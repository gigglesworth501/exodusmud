Plan  Born in the wintery town of Elder's Gap, Jenifer was always called
princess by her mother and grandmother.  They always said to her that they
hope that one day, Jenifer would become a real princess and would fall in
love with a man who would not rape her.  Her grandmother had been raped by
Lord Vryce's uncle.  Her mom had been raped by a thief on the way home from
market.  And so, Jenifer was born of that sick consumation.  Jenifer has
forever been on a journey of her heart to find the man that would forever be
her soulmate.  There is a darker side to her though, she is also questing to
find the man known as Squire Dark.  Altavarin LeDarks' father was the man
who had raped her mother, unbeknownst to her, he had killed his father
following Altavarin'sOC "treason" at Blackmorre Castle for the murder of his
beloved sorceress.
