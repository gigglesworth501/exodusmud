Desc Standing here is a young man. He stands about 5'5, and has a slender, wiry build.
He has light brown hair, and crystal blue eyes. His armor is well kept, but looks
ill-fitting, as though he is outgrowing it faster than he can find replacements.
His eyes are almost constantly in motion, as though he's trying to look at
everything at once.

Bcry  jumps high into the air, wielding his deadly throwing dagger!~
Plan  My earliest memory is that of my mother dying by the hands of Vro'ath.  I
remember little else for some time.  I counted 10 winters that I served them
as slave.  They instilled into me that I was a slave every day, taking
enjoyment in my suffering.  It was in my 3rd year with them that I made my
first attempt at escape.  When I was caught, a guard beat me to near death. 
When I recovered, I had lost my hearing.  A year later, a band of humans
raided the Vro'ath camp.  From my cage where I was kept, I cried out, hoping
for rescue.  Whoever the humans were, they died quickly under Vro'ath blade.
I remember well the face of the man who had actually reached my cage, and
although I could not hear what he was saying as the sword struck him from
behind, I knew that I belonged free.  Even to die was more free than to live
within a cage.  After the battle was over, the Vro'Ath decided to feast upon
the would-be rescuers.  They made a stew of them, and to teach me a lesson,
my tongue was cut out of my mouth and added to the pot.  I was not fed
again, until I had eaten some of the stew.  It was at that moment that I
began planning.  It was not until 6 years later that I finally got my
chance.  I managed to fool them that I was beaten, and eventually my guard
laxed over the years.  One night I snuck away while the camp slept.  I ran
for weeks, hiding during the day, foraging as best I could.  Eventually, I
came to a town called Thesden.  I had nothing but the ragged clothes on my
back.  I wandered the streets cautiously for days, begging for money and
food--stealing it when begging was slim.  It was a female Dwarf named Serena
that brought me out of the streets.  She must have taken pity on me..  For
what reason I still do not fathom.  She gave me fighting equipment, and took
me out to the prarie, and taught me to survive.  I still look over my
shoulder, knowing that eventually I will have to face my captors again... 
And hoping I will have enough cunning to take their lives...  Or enough
strength to take my own...  For some time I grew.  I fought side by side
with those that I learned to call friend, my skills slowly getting sharper. 
One such time, we were fighting in the western forrest, we took on another
that sought to sharpen their skills.  As this had happened many times in the
past, I thought little of this at the time.  When I saw her for the first
time, I was amazed at her beauty.  She introduced herself as Helenium, and
although I was unable to hear her voice, I knew simply by the way she moved
that it must be as lovely as she.  She began singing and her words moved me.
I could not hear the words, but the spirit of them lifted our hearts and
focused our minds for battle.  I was in awe at such a power.  During our
travels, out of jest, she stole a kiss from me, and inadvertantly stole my
heart as well...
