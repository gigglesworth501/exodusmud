Plan  `iJuliana Demiez `owas born in the city of `dThesden`o, but leftabandoned by her parents before she could truly learned anything about themor their ways of life.  She was never taught right or wrong, good or evil,so she slowly but surely spiraled into t he ways of evil.  In the company of`jTuli `oor `jSigurd`o, she would merciless attack and kill.  No guilt foundher conscious, she was lost to evil and it's demonic ways.  Before long shegrew into her strength and power, aquiring the skills of a powerfulSorceress.  `iJuliana `odid not know of her destiny, of the blood thatflowed through her veins, nor of what she represented. ----- `iJuliana `odidnot think of her parents until the day she bumped into a man named `gCliveEvenstar`o.  He was sitting in `kDevon Square Center `oexplaining to thetownspeople they didn't need to fear any longer, `nBrotherhood `owas back toprotect them.  `iJuliana `opaused her passing, listening to this man'sstrong and confident words.  His eyes caught hers and he smiled at her, shewalked over and touched his hand, but the image that filled her mind madeher jerk away, screaming at the sight only she saw."  Who are you?"  ,`iJuliana `ospat at the man.  He explained he was the leader of`nBrotherhood`o, bringing the clan back in order to protect the town of`dThesden`o.  `iJuliana `oshook her head accusingly, not understanding whatthe vision completely.  Why had she seen her parents next to this man?  Whyhad she seen them die?  `gClive `omust have recognize the pain and confusionon her face, because he sat down next to her and asked her who she was. When she said her name he smiled, a bitter-sweet smile.  "Your parents weregreat."  `iJuliana `olooked up at him and tilted her head, silently askinghim for more information.  He continued on to explain that her parents weremembers of the `nBrotherhood Clan `oin their youth and adult lives.  He knewthem only by name, for they were rarely in `dThesden`o, usually off fightinga greater fight in other areas, but still loyal clan members.  The one timehe had the pleasure of meeting them, it involved no conversation, unless youcounted the soothing sounds of a powerful sorceress' spells hitting theirtarget, or the cracking sounds of a strong warriors' weapons against anotherbody.  He continued to explain that it was the last fight `iJuliana's`oparents ever fought, giving their lives in the process of protecting`mKing Athanmere`o.  ----- The days after aquiring this knowledge were noteasy for `iJuliana`o,instead of embracing her destiny of fighting the good`dThesden`o, she retreated further into the ways of evil.Collecting an enslaved warrior to do her bidding when others were not aroundto help her kill the residents of Abbey.  She rarely saw `hClive Evenstar`o,and when their pathes did cross she made sure they uncossed, and quickly. She felt guilty, his eyes watching her every move, as if she were betrayingher parents.  `iJuliana `odidn't have very many worries, and she loved toexplore, so the `jShale Peaks `owas her favorite place to go, dodging thecreatures who attempting to attack her and bring her down.  Her quickreflexes helped her greatly, but one day she wasn't quick enough, and the`kPatriach`o caught her.  She screamed in pain, needing help, attempting tofend him off with her balls of acid and draconion breaths, but to no avail. She was near death, when someone made a loud sound and the `kPatriach `oflewacross the room landing hard on the ground.  `gClive `otook her hand andhelped her up, pulling her quickly from the `kPatriach `oas possible.  Oncethey reached the forest `gClive `oslowed down, and `iJuliana `ofell onto theground.  `iJuliana `olooked at him, curious to why he saved her, what madehim save her when she was killing the innocents of `dThesden`o.  He looked`iJuliana `ostraight into the eyes and said gently, "because withoutforgiveness, there is no life."  ----- `iJuliana's `odays of evil were nomore.  She quit killing in Abbey, released her enslaved warrior, and vowedto join the ranks of `nBrotherhood `owhen the time was right.  She went to`gClive `oas often as she could, seeking his advice and guidence.  He becamea close friend, one that could never be sacrificed, as she continued on herpath, in hopes to fufill her destiny.  `` ~
