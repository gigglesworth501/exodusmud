Vers 7
Desc `cAloreth is a taller elf, about five and a half feet in height.  His hair is``
`ablack`c, but shines a `brusty red`c in `kbright sunlight`c.  His eyes are `edeep blue`c like``
`cthe `esky`c overhead after the `ksun`c has just set.  His skin is the `hchalky grey`c of``
`cthe `hdarker spots`c on the `omoon`c, which seem to `og`hl`oo`hw `cwith their own `ol`hi`og`hh`ot`c, though``
`cit is only reflection.  He looks relaxed as he stands, yet he appears ready to``
`ctake action with little warning.  His confidence is betrayed only by his `eeyes`c,``
`cwhich search out signs of danger, slowly, but thoroughly.``

Plan  `eAloreth came from a small nomadic community of elves in the `cForest Fierense`e.``
`eHis father was a `cranger`e, and his mother an `lenchantress`e.  While his father``
`espent most of each day or night in the woods, keeping the community `ahidden``
`efrom non-elves, his mother spent time crafting `lmagics`e to improve the tools``
`eof the community, things such as chests which weigh less than the items in``
`ethem, chairs which fold up into a compact box, or unfold into a chair when``
`ea command word is spoken.  As a boy, Aloreth learned a few `lspells`e from his``
`emother.  One enabled him to fix his toys if the broke.  Another gave him``
`egeneral and approximate information about the function of any item he held.``
`eSoon Aloreth knew he would not be content living in his community for the``
`erest of his life.  So, shortly after his `bceremony of manhood`e, he set out``
`efor the city of Thesden, east of his `cforest`e.  Upon arrival, he got a job``
`ewith an `cherbalist`e, which he worked for a time while studying `lmagic`e in his``
`eevenings.  While many young `images`e were studying spells of `bwar`e, `jdetection`e,``
`eand other specific `lspells`e, Aloreth studied the principles of `lmagic`e, and``
`efound his knowledge and insight growing as quickly as his capacity for``
`ecasting `lspells`e.  Soon Aloreth practiced his first `nreal`l spell`e, `aarmor`e.  It``
`ehelped him in his travels in the `deastern prairie`e.  He also spent much time``
`ebringing his body into good physical condition, and learned the use of the``
`dstaff`e.  Soon he met `aWyvern`e, a syvin who seemed at first to be a `cranger`e, but``
`eturned out to have a few `hskeletons`e in his `dwardrobe`e.  Their friendship formed``
`eas they adventured together.  Aloreth learned enough to be self sufficient,``
`eneeding neither to return to town for `ifood`e nor for `lwater`e.  He worked on one``
`ecombat spell, `nlightning bolt`e, but found it to be disappointing.  Soon he``
`ewill learn the powerful `mcharm person`e spell.  Yes, the falatus will soon have``
`eplenty of work.``
