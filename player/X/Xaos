Plan  -----Once every thousand years a day comes to pass whence there is a day with
no sun, and anight with no moon. This day has come to be known as the Day of
POWER. Upon this day there is an artificial light, created by the unification 
of the three great spheres that support the entire universe as we know it. 
It is upon this day that all life on earth is regenerated, all plant life is
refreshed and the world returns to the ethereal vision it was upon it's
creation by the great God himself, Chaos.
   
-----The last Day of POWER was an especially great one. For besides 
commemorating the passing of a thousand years, it was also the Day of the 
Hero which only occurs once every fifty thousand years. It is believed in 
myths commonly sung by bards across the realm, and printed in story books
read to children by their attendants and mothers, that on the Day of the 
Hero a great warrior is brought into this world to do the bidding of the 
great Chaos himself. Never in history had these two great days ever coincided
so the outcome was never even considered and such a connection was never 
made or ever thought to exist, and was henceforth known as the Day of
Junction. This is the the story of what happened when this great joining
of power and a hero became injucted with one another.
     
-----On the great Day of Junction, a man by the name of Lord Delacroix 
Tyraken was sauntering pensively through his enormous expanse of beautiful
roling fields and surverying all that he owned with great happiness. He was
married to a beautiful woman by the name of Lily who was from another country
and Delacroix has fell in love with during his tour of duty in the royal 
Armada. Delacroix was an very honorable, noble, hard-working, self-made
man. He had not started out a rich noble, yet through loyal service and hard
work he had amassed enough money to buy himself a mediocre plot of land under
which he discovered an expanse of gold while plowing in preparation for 
the spring crops. Delacroix promptly invested this money into the 
international spice trade and in turn reaped in a handsome profit. The skill
that he showed was so impressive that the king himself appointed him the 
Royal Treasurer, putting him in charge of of the royal fortune. Within the 
next four years he had tripled the royal fortune and quadrupled his own. The
King being very pleased, awarded Delacroix with the largest plot of land ever
to be owned by anyone in that realm besides the King himself. There was only
one thing that marred the Tyraken home. This was the lack of children. After
many years  of trying, many visits  to the best doctors across the globe,
Delacroix and Lily were not blessed with any children.
     
-----As Delacroix was meandering across his fields, his mind occupied with 
affairs of state, he was suddenly frightened by a powerful bolt of red 
lightning that struck the ground not ten feet away from him. It struck with
such a furious strength that the ground beneath him trembled violently upon
impact. It was with much agility that Delacroix managed to stay on his feet,
only to be hurled to the ground by the crashing blast caused by a mix of 
mighty thunder and high velocity winds. As Delacroix was curled up in a fetus
position waiting for it all to end a LOUD chanting came down from the sky,
spoken in an ancient language that Delacroix could not understand.
As the chanting got louder and LOUDER, all around him there started to drop
bounce off the ground and emit a blinding flash, only to dissapear a moment
later. After about twenty minutes of chanting everything stopped and silence 
once again reigned in these peaceful fields. Slowly arising from the ground,
Delacroix looked around too see nothing but small grassy mounds. He gazed
up at the sky in awe and saw a bright star twinkle brightly as if blinking 
concerning some deeply shared secret. Thinking it was all just some strange
hallucination due to his recent lack of sleep, Delacroix started to head home
to his sumptuous palace to catch up on some missed sleep.
     
-----After taking two steps Delacroix froze, thinking that he had heard the
crying of the baby. Shaking his head he thought it to be another 
hallucination until he heard it again, only louder this time. He promptly did
an about face and headed towards the sound of the crying, which was emenating
from the exact spot that the lightning bolt made it's fateful manifestation.
There lay, heavily wrappedin the husk of the vegetable corn, a large, crying
