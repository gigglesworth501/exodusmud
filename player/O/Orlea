Plan  A tiny mage sits on a hilltop in the Eastern prairie looking out over
the town of Thesden.  Hearing your approach she turns toward you 
and for a moment you catch a rare glimpse of something very sad
and vulnerable in her eyes.  She smiles warmly at you and says softly, 
"So you would like to know my tale young one?  Sit here next to me 
and I will tell you of a love greater then the stars in the sky." 
.
Slowly she begins to tell her tale, "It all happened a very long time
ago you see.  I was once Immortal.  Now, now don't look at me that way,
tis the truth I tell.  Now sit still and let me finish." 
"I came into being many, many years ago.  A fledging Immortal, over-confident
and full of myself.  It all came easy to me, my immortality that is," she says
softly.  "I never had to work for it, it was handed to me by the gods for
some unknown reason, maybe it was my test.  In any case, here I was a 
powerful being, with no sense of purpose."
.
"It was about that time that another immortal was created by the gods. His
name is Moonlyte," she says in a sad voice. "Yes, I do mean /that/ Moonlyte.
Now close your mouth, your gonna swallow a fly."  "Anyway, it was love at 
first sight for me.  He was so strong, the power radiated from his very being.
But in spite of his strength, there was also a gentleness."  Sighing softly
she continues.  "We had a wonderful time in those early days, learning the
land, teasing the mortals and just slowly falling in love.  But you see, it
wasn't enough for me.  I grew jealous of the mortals, punishing them without
reason, bringing my wrath upon them, just simply because they were taking
my love from me, wasting his time with their silly requests and petty
arguments."  She looks out over the town, her eyes filled with tears,
"I thought they were taking him from me.  I was too self involved to 
realise that though we had love, we still needed this world to exist,
for without it, we would be no more."
"Being the self centered god that I was, I wanted him all to myself.
The other gods took notice of our quarrels and of my mistreatment
of the mortals.  They brought us before a council and demanded
we make a choice, to serve this world as an immortal and forsake
our love, or to exist no more."
.
"Statis, led the council...some say he was in love with me.  I 
really don't know, thats neither here nor there," she says shaking her
head, "Moonlyte spoke first, his voice bringing shivers to my soul.
Looking straight into my eyes he softly told me he loved me, then 
he turned to the council and said that he chose to serve the mortals
of this land.  I remember screaming, crying that I would never give
him up that before I would do that all of the mortals of this land
would perish. After that there was nothing but darkness."
.
"I awoke on this hill, not knowing where I was or how much time
had passed.  Summoning my power I attempted to transport myself to
town. I failed, somehow my power was not working. I walked to town,
stopping to speak to some farmers on the road. They told me of Moonlyte's
greatness, his love of the people. He had become a great god, the 
highest rank.  It seems that many years had passed, how many I do not
know.  But here I was, mortal...destined to live in a world where
my love was torn from me."  Smiling she says, "A few years have passed
since then. I am learning to be humble, living for those few
prescious moments when our great god is among us.  As for the
mortals I once mistreated...I have sworn my life to them, helping 
them to learn this wonderful land, an just maybe...they will grow
to love it, as I have."
