Vers 8
Desc `gHere stands a tall, lithe Canthi with long, flowing `hwhite `ghair. 
His pale bluish-green skin `gseems to glisten in the morning sun, though he
has been dry for quite some time.  The sheer beauty `gof such a creature is
stifling, and at first glance, one might question his gender.  As he turns
to `gface you, you notice something rather odd.  Unlike and other Canthi you
have ever see, his eyes are a `g deep, shimmering `bruby `gin color.  As he
stares unblinking at you, a slight chill runs down your `gspine.  Even so,
you find yourself not being able to look away.  His simple garb, though
`gseeming to consist of little more than fine `dleather `gand `eb`llu`ee `gcloth, it looks
as if the sharpest sword would be a mere twig against it.  He breathes in
slightly, and then an eerie tone escapes his delicate gills.  `gHe then
pulls a small, humble clay ocarina out of his pocket, and beings to play. 
`gAs the notes sound out, a small celestial symbol `i(`e(`d*`e)`i) `gbegins to glow
upon the clay instrument.  You suddenly feel at peace with life, with
the world, and that this man is your oldest and dearest friend ... His eyes.
Look at his beautiful, warm, inviting eyes.  Yes, you can trust this man
with your life ... He is your ...

Plan  `dYour standing within a mildly spacious room that seems to have
been built out from underneath the `cr`do`oo`dt`cs `dof a gigantic oak. Huge, tendril like roots
snake down from the ceiling down into the ground beneath your feet, acting as a support
for the imposing weight of the earth above. Even though this cave like structure is deep under the
ground, the soft lighting from the `bg`il`ko`bw`ki`in`bg `bb`ira`kzi`ier`bs `dand `dw`ki`ock`ke`dr l`ka`om`kp`ds hanging from some
of the roots give it a soft, almost comforting sort of presence. The ground seems to have been patted
or pressed down long ago, giving it a hard, almost clay like substance, making it relatively free of 
actual loose dirt. There is a bookshelf built 
into the wall on the far side of the cave, its many shelves spilling over
with books and journals from the occupants journeys and travels. There is a statue of a man on the
opposite wall of the bookshelf. He stands tall and firm, being made out of carved `cw`doo`cd`d. Resting in his
hands is a large bowl where `om`hil`ok `drests, constantly `nf`gr`oe`gs`nh `dand `nc`goo`nl`d. To the left of the statue sits a several 
very large `bcu`is`ohi`io`bns `dthat look very fluffy and soft, they seem to have several nicely cured `dh`ai`dd`ae`ds draped
across them -- the tough, but extremely soft for of a `dm`aou`dnt`aai`dn `db`aea`dr cub from the `hW`oil`hd N`oo`ar`ot`hh`d.``
