Desc Epona is impeccably dressed in the finest silks and armors, in an 
unusual but striking combination of mauve and orange.  Who could have
known how well those colors could be used together if the lovely Epona had 
not tried the combination?  The puce is really the finishing touch.
With the figure of a houri and the delicate, elven face of an angel, 
Epona is definitely worth a second, third, and fourth look.  The wintry 
darkness of her eyes and the unsteady glow of lunacy contained within
carries the unmistakeable warning not to touch.

Plan  It is whispered that those of extraordinary power either learn to control
their power or go mad.  Epona went mad.  Sort of.  Some days, she is lucid,
and other days, well, the words "stark raving loonie" would be best used to
describe her.  How or why she went insane is not known.  When she is lucid,
she will not speak of her past -- only that sometimes even evil will
sacrifice all for the greater good.  Whatever it is that broke her mind,
also made her unreservedly evil, likely to kill things even in her lucid
moments (which grow increasingly shorter) for pure self-interest.  When she
is not lucid, she speaks of a great elven city, more lovely than any other,
with tones of love and hate as only the truly insane can hate.  It is also
when she is insane that she is the most dangerous, for then she may spend
all day hunting mice in Thesden to teleport them so they may explore...  Or
killing herself for words spoken in jest (sometimes speaking of the elven
city sets her off) by attacking much larger mobs.  Those mobs grow slowly
fewer as she rises in power.

ExDe papermsg~ The Oceanic Geographer By Tempest Fornguard
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
- The world of Exodus is covered with over three quarters water.  The
majority of this great body of water is the Great Ocean, surrounding both
continents, Ividia and the Great Continent.  The second major body of water
is the Sea of Fate, a strange and mysterious waterway to the west of the
Fierness Forest.  Within these bodies of water are many forms of life, and
the lands they reach are far and varied.  I have written this humble
offering in the hopes that it will aid you in your journeys across these
watery expanses. 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------Tempest-Fornguard-----------------------------------
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Chapter I : Descriptions of Regions
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
- The Sea of Fate : The Sea of Fate has within it two island groups and can
be reached by three methods.  There is an Inlet opening into the sea of fate
on the easternmost point of the Sea of Fate in the Fierness Forest's western
border.  Farther to the south in Bayou Laforge is found another enterance,
also in that swamps western border.  Finally, on the southern border of the
Sea of Fate is found a enterance to the Great Ocean.  This opening is found
to the North/Northwest of Freeport.  The two islands found in the Sea of
Fate are Telkion Isle and the Silver Coast.  Telkion Isle is a fell and evil
place.  Upon landind upon this island I saw sights of death and ill omen. 
Those who venture here would be cautioned to be prepared for the worst.  The
Silver Coast is a jungle paradise, inhabited by monkeys, exotic birds, and
various other jungle creatures.  When searching inland, I found fresh water.
I also found the tracks of a great jungle cat.  Knowing that these beasts
often track and attack their prey without warning, I ended my survey until I
could bring a larger exploration party. 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Great Ocean : The Great Ocean contains a variety of creatures on the
Northern Coast.  The northern coast region refers to the area on the coast
of the Great Continent, north of the Sea of Fate on the Continents Western
coast and north of the Eastern Prairie on the Great Continents eastern
coast.  This area is home to a variety of large see creatures, including
sharks, whales and giant squid.  Also to be found in this area are giant sea
horses, who some have told me can be tamed, though I have never seen it
myself. 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Areas of Note : The areas of note which can be found in or around the
Great Ocean are (from West to East, the meridian being Thesden): The Ruined
Underwater City, The Sea of Fate, Freeport, Ebon Downs, Dead Man's Cave,
Colwyn Bay (and Thesden), The Eastern Prairie and The Continent of Ividia. 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Under Water City : The ruined underwater city is found to the west and
south of the Sea of Fate.  It contains Marid Djinns, Locathat, Dragon
Turtles, and a variety of creatures foul and fair Caution is advised for
those adventuring here.  The means of both access and egress to this city is
a stupendous whirlpool spanning almost 30 miles in diameter.  One need now
worry of one's ship being swallowed by this titan, for the currents at it's
surface are very mild. 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Freeport : The city of Freeport is a merchants city, known for a modest
ship building industry.  It can be located on the southern most point of the
great continent, south of the Macocamp Outlands, 160 miles or so due
south/southwest of Thesden as the crow flies.  It is surrounded by ocean at
all points except the north, which is bordered by a narrow river estuary. 
Protecting Freeport from the inhavitants of the Macocamp Outlands to the
north.
