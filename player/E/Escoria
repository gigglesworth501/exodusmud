ExDe quest~ `dThere is a legend of a magical `istone`d that glows and flickers with light.  It is
said that this stone originally belonged to the `kGoddess of the Enternal Flame`d,
who kept it within a magical `bstone box`d that only she possessed the key to open.
This box was very precious to her because the box itself contained some of her
life essence.  In time, the `ibox`d was stolen by a jealous `kfire spirit`d who was
convinced he could unlock the `bbox`d and possess the `istone`d.  The `kspirit`d stole
the `bbox`d from the `kGoddess`d and fled and has hidden himself in an ancient tomb,
locked away for eons in a distant desert.  Only one `jkey`d is said to have the
ability to open the tomb where the `kfire spirit`d is hidden.  For centuries, this
key was lost, and the story faded into legend.  Then, only a few decades ago,
the `jkey`d was uncovered by a great hero named Armanos.
`d
Armanos was a mighty warrior who fought for Lord Eyunel in the years before
the great Vro'ath seige upon his castle.  Eyunel had dispatched Armanos on a
quest to return the `istone`d to the `kGoddess`d to win her favor.  Armanos searched
for years for the `jkey`d to the tomb, finally locating it.  As he returned to
tell Lord Eyunel of his discovery, he was ambushed by a garrison of Vro'ath
warriors, who would become the vanguard of the seige against Eyunel's castle.
When Armanos was laid to rest, the ancient `jkey`d was never recovered, but his
ghost is said to haunt his gravesite even now.  Supposedly, with his dying
breath, Armanos swore a curse upon the `jkey`d that if anyone else tried to claim
it, the `jkey`d could quickly srumble to dust, so that anyone who took the `jkey`d in
search of treasure would only have a few days at the most to unlock the tomb.
`d

`o
[OOC Note]
When you have returned the box to the Goddess, say that you have her box.
Then she will be able to reward you for the quest.
`o
If you get turned around or confused while dealign with the Goddess, just say
"start over" when you are in the room and you can begin your conversation again.``
``
`oThis quest is only for characters level 75 or lower.``
