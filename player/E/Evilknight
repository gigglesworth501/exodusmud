Plan  ``Class:      Dark Knights
Races:      Human, Canthi Elf, Syvin, Dwarf, Vro'ath
Alignment:  Evil only (penalty for going above 0)
``
(This idea is not mine.  I borrowed HEAVILY from a guild in another mud I once
played.  However, this guild has not existed in that mud for over 8 years, so
I don't mind suggesting it here.)
``
Dark Knights are a group who have devoted their lives to the worship of evil
and the mastery of the dark blade, their God has cursed them with.  They can
wield no other weapon than this blade and it grows with the knight.  Knights
who are starting out have a weak weapon and it is up to the knight to make it
more powerful by killing the forces of good around him.  Should the knight be
so foolish as to stray from the path of evil, his sword will be confiscated
by the God of evil until the knight has redeemed himself and returned to the
dark ways of his craft.
``
When the knight takes a life, he can steal the soul of his victim by claiming
it with his sword.  The more powerful the victim, the more essence the corpse
contains.  This energy is stored in the sword and can be used to improve the
blade at the Dark Knight guild hall.
``
The sword is a part of the knight and it cannot be removed or disarmed.  If
the knight is killed, the sword rots, but can be summoned later with a spell.
If the weapon is someone gotten away from the knight, (should be impossible)
no other guild may wield it, nor may any other knight, nor any mob.
``
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ideally, I would like this to be a remort-only class, meaning that it is
available only to players who have reached level 90 in another class.  An imm
would have to set the player to this class and then demote him to level 1 so
he can start anew.  This would also give some of the bored 90's something to do.
``
Dark Knights require the blood of the innocent to satisfy their God and to
advance within their own ranks.  For this reason, to advance to the next level,
the knight must increase his kill count by 100.  Therefore, a level 10 knight
would need a kc of 900 and a level 90 would need 8900.  This is designed to
prevent anyone from rising quickly through the ranks.  This guild is very strong
and as a result, will require patience, hard work, and TIME.
``
The knights are similar in many respects to the Paladin guild and should have
roughly the same hitpoints and spellpoints as a Paladin.  This guild should NOT
be as sturdy as the Rangers or Warriors, but it is capable of doing more damage
in combat than either of these.
``
The knights should have the following warrior-type skills:  Sword, Second attack,
Third Attack, Enhanced Damage, Fast Heal, Shield Block, Bash, Kick, Trip, Disarm,
Dodge, Parry, Riding, Door Bash, Rescue.
``
The knights should NOT have the following warrior-type skills:  Dual Wield, Charge,
Butcher, Berserk, Throwing.  These skills would unfairly take away from the other
fighting classes.
``
Enhancing the sword are sword spells, which can give the sword temporary flags.
Flaming Blade, Frost Blade, Shocking Blade, Vorpal Blade, and Vampiric Blade are
all spells that can be learned at HIGHER levels, allowing the knight to inflict
even greater damage upon his enemies.  Certain "burst" spells can also be cast,
which affect everyone in the room who is not evil.  Flame Burst, Frost Burst,
and Lightning Burst are spells that are available at HIGHER levels.  These
spells come at a great cost to the knight.
``
These are the only spells/prayers the knight should have.  One option might
be to have a 'call evil mount' skill and give the swords the LANCE flag.
``
Level 1 knights have a sword that does 1d1 damage.  As the knight kills things,
he can buy improvements to the sword by spending energy points (ep) which are
determined by the level of the kill.  A level 1 kill has 1 ep and a level 100
kill has 100.  The knight MUST be the one who strikes the killing blow or else
the corpse is worthless.  Eight is the magic number for the Dark Knights and
you will see why.

ExDe papermsg~ `lWelcome to the realms of `nExodus`h.  Upon entering our world,
you will notice that there is no traditional mud school or newbie zone.
It is our intention to immerse players immediately, the world around you being
your entire 'newbie area'.  Thus, reading this `bNeophyte Manifesto`h becomes
monumentally important to your prosperity and survival here.  Note that   
everything covered in this document is pursued at greater length in the  
help files. Please also type story to read something of Exodus history.

The manifesto is divided into several categories.  
To read the different parts, just type look `kkeyword`h.

`o[`kYou`o] [`hThe `kworld `haround you`o] [`hOther `kplayers`o] [`hYour `kplace`h in the world`o]`h               
~
ExDe you~ `o[`iYou`o]`h                                                                 
You are the center of your universe.  There are many ways in which you        
can make your character unique, aside from the customization you have         
already undertaken in choosing your skills and attributes.  You can           
change your title [help title], give yourself a description [help description],
formulate a battlecry [help battlecry]  -- and you can do it all in color    
[help color].                                                   
               
When your character is born, he/she/it receives a set of low level
equipment. To see what you are wearing, type equipment.  To see what you are 
holding, type inventory.  Exodus supports full abbreviation, so if you don't 
want to type out these full commands, you can use 'eq' and 'i', respectively. 
If you should ever lose your newbie gear, you can type outfit to re-eq.      

Your character's attributes and nuances are important to your evolution as     
you rise in power and knowledge.  To see your character's score sheet,        
type score.  To see quickly how wealthy your character is, or how much        
experience you require to level, type worth.  The experience you receive      
from killing non-player-characters (NPCs), exploring the world, or            
participating in both built-in area and immortal run quests determines        
your level. [help experience, help level]                                     
~
ExDe world~ `o[`iThe world around you`o]`h     
There are many things in the world that you will become aware of as you       
wander about.  The world of Exodus is vast, comprised of many mystical        
lands.  [help areas]    
A few commands are necessary to master if you want to experience the    
full impact of Exodus: look, where, and who. [help look] [help where] &       
[help who] have extensive information concerning these important commands.    
    
`o[`hobjects`o]`h                                                              
Mundane and arcane items alike can be found, bought, or battled for in    
the realms of Exodus.  Although you may discover a proliferation of
telluric items within its sprawls, the luckiest adventurers may sometimes     
come across fabled treasures, rare beyond description.                        
                                                                              
`o[`hmobiles`o]`h                                                              
Unlike many other foriegn environments, the extensive lands of Exodus are   
inhabited by both intelligent players, and...intelligent monsters.          
Instinctual animals may not offer much of a challenge, but cognizant           
creatures with actual aspects of sentience (for example, city guards,       
farmers, or soldiers) may just surprise you -- look at them, talk to them,  
do what you deem to be wise around them to see how they react.  And should  
you choose to engage in combat with them and find yourself over your head,  
you may just find that enraged farmer or cityguard hunting you down to      
finish the job.                                                                
~
ExDe player players~ `o[`iother players`o]`h                                                        
Although most of the inhabitants of Exodus may appear to be friendly,          
it is always advisable to take everything with a grain of salt and             
view the world through a cynic's eyes -- even the most harmless-looking      
player can evolve into a vicious enemy in the span of a few seconds.           
Exploring the large universe that Exodus provides is a very good way          
to avoid messy conflicts with other violent players, and is strongly          
encouraged, especially to new players.                                        
                                                                             
This advice does not directly apply to players level 1 - 8 (as these        
lower-level players are protected by immortal intervention), but it           
is advisable that you begin exploring the planet early on, to get a            
grasp of the terrain and places to adventure.                                
   
Player-killing outside of the 10-level range established by the               
creators of the lands of Exodus will result in the garnering of a              
wanted flag, and possibly a trial [help justice, help laws].                   
~
ExDe place~ [Your place in the world]
After establishing your persona within the Realms of Exodus, you will
most likely be tempted to exercise your freedom and broaden your 
horizens by taking advantage of the many built-in features of the world:
  
[Clans]
Clans are groups of like-minded players that have both the willpower and
the manpower to organize themselves in objectives that may include
conquering areas, warring with other clans, and/or promoting 
a specific goal or cause. See [help clan and clan war].
  
[Homes]
You can establish private sectors for yourself, your clan, or your loved
one(s) in certain areas in the world of Exodus, for a price. This is best
done after you have become an experienced adventurer and amassed
some money. Refer to [help homes] for more information.
  
[Transportation]
The forms of transport in the Realm of Exodus are many and varied.
Elevator mechanisms coupled with moving battle machines, boats,
mounts, and magical means of transport are ways to move yourself 
around all kinds of terrain. For traditionalists, you can also walk to 
most places. Please read the following files:
[help boat, help mount, help transportation].
  
[Good places to go]
A good place for newbies to start is the Thesden Animal Exhibition 
Gardens, informally called the zoo. It is located on Welford Road,
on the far east side of Thesden. Once the pleasures of the Zoo have 
begun to pall, you can explore, hunt wabbits!, or satisfy your 
bloodthirst at Ashton Gardens (near the center of Thesden), or 
in the Eastern Plains or Sarrendale Farms (outside of the East
Gate of Thesden).
