Plan  `aTuruk winced slightly as he heard the words his father spoke.  "My child is
dead.  A ghost stands before me."  Turuk calmed his nerves and turned around,
not saying a word, according to ritual.  He began walking without turning back.
An axe, some bloodbread, a small container of water, and enough clothing to keep
warm at night, were all that he carried.  He stopped by his favorite stream
and pulled a pouch out from under a rock on the streambed.  It contained a hand-
ful of silver pennies... not enough to exchange for a gold coin, but enough to
be worth stopping for.  He knew he would be unable to spend it, though.  The
ritual prohibited him from speaking to any of Ne'Shajh's people unless he first
killed the proper number of non-vro'ath.
``
`jLeagues later, as he had just ran out of food, he spied smoke rising out of the
trees.  Another hour's travel and he came to a large farming area.  He stayed
away from the farmhouses where workers with scythes and sickles were apparently
eating something that came from large kettles and smelled awful, even from many
rods away.  Occasionally he found a mole, rat, duck, goose, or other small
animal he could kill and eat.  As he had been taught, he sacrificed the inedible
remains to Ne'Shajh and watched as the bones melted and coalesced into coins of
silver.  He continued southward, until he came to a road leading east and west.
It was morning, so he went west, away from the sun.  On the way he found a stash
of discarded clothing and armor.  He took it and wore it.  In the evening, he
came to the gate of a city.
``
`dTuruk waited until nightfall, then pulled his cloaks around him, and entered the
gate.  To his luck there wasn't a guard.  He reached an intersection and heard
the sounds of animals to the south.  He found the source of the sound... a zoo.
This zoo seemed to be open at all hours of the day.  Turuk bought a ticket and
entered.  The first thing he noticed were the other visitors to the zoo.  They
made terrible noises at the animals, and seemed like they should be the ones in
cages.  Turuk made sure he was alone with one, and attacked her.  She tried to
fight Turuk by hitting him, but his axe and his brutal strength were too much
for her.  Her warm heart was the most delicious thing Turuk had eaten in days.
He took several coins from her corpse, and moved on, killing more zoo patrons
and some of the zoo staff.  When they were dead he killed animals, eating
severed body parts as he went.  Soon he was tired and realized the death he had
caused would be noticed with the rising sun.  He left the zoo and hid in a
meeting room of the Argent Lance guild, which he found further to the south.
When he entered, with his hood up and his axe hanging at his belt, nobody
questioned his right to be there.  For all anybody was concerned, he was just
another soldier down on his luck and unable to afford a room at an inn.
``
`iIn the morning, Turuk found a weapon shop nearby, and purchased an axe made of
bright polished steel.  Its quality surpassed the axe he had been using, though
it seemed made more for chopping through trees than flesh and bone.  He left the
city then, and travelled east on the road.  Soon he came to an isolated farm.
Turuk entered, and killed everything he found, including the farmers.  He went
further east, and came to a farmhouse, where the lazy old farmer was smoking a
pipe of foul weeds on his porch.  Turuk attacked the old farmer, but almost
regretted it, for it seemed the man had once been a soldier.  As he was checking
the corpse for valuables, the farmer's wife came down from the loft wielding
a set of nasty looking knitting needles, which were rusty and covered with
filth.  Turuk slew her, but not without getting sick from the needles' wounds.
He made camp in the farmhouse and healed his wounds, then proceeded north along
a dirt road which led to a village.  Many of the peasants in the village were
sickeningly easy to kill, but the troupe of performers stationed there were
wiser to the ways of battle.  Turuk slew two of them, but another two escaped.
He proceeded to a manor and killed some of the pathetic servants there.  One had
