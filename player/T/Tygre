Desc before you stands a slim, disheavled looking creature. Course, perhaps
Creature is the wrong world, for when you look closer you see that
it is really a Canthi! But, this canthi seems to have fallen on some
strange times. The hair that sprouts from his forearms and ankles seems
to have been dyed in rainbows of colors, with no pattern at all!
The hair on his head seems even worse! The hair is spiked up in random
directions, with each spike dyed a differnt color of the rainbow. The
Spike dead center of his head seems to have been dyed white, and is 
almost invisible, as if by magic. This strange Canthi seems to be
muttering to himself... yet his conversation is directed to the thin
air all about him. You keep hearing the word 'elephant' said over and
over. Looking in his eyes you relize that this one's mind must be far
gone, for only insanity seems to be lurking in those depths. As you 
watch the eyes change color, every shade of the rainbow, just like his
hair. This trully looks to be a creature of Chaos....

Bcry  cry says "The VOICES told me to do it!"~
Plan  `fI am Tygre, a bard of clan Fools.  It is a clan that seems to be 
dedicated to nothing more than a good time.. to nothing more then 
being fools and dunderheads and what not.  But hidden beneath 
that could be something more...
   
`fBut anyways, off to my history!
   
`fI was born as a Canthi, and seem to have spent most of my life 
as one.  my parents were both very strict, the only allowed me to 
do whatever I wanted as long as I never bothered then.  One day I 
made the grave mistake of bothering them and found that in the 
seats normally occupied by my parents was nothing more than 
thier clothes stuffed full of straw!  Someone must have abducted 
my parents!
   
`fI knew that this must be true, of course.  The ransom note was a 
very puzzleing piece of paper, it read as follows:
   
`hTygre,
   
If you have found this note it means you finally relized that we have 
left you. We would be sorry about this but your brother (whom you 
have never met) has found a small fortune and we have left with 
him. Good luck, and good bye!
   
-Mom and Dad
   
`fYou see, my parents would never have left me, and I know I did 
not have a brother. So, I set out to go find my parents, no matter 
how long it takes!
   
`fBut I have found something that puzzles me further! In all my 
searches I have not found my parents. Oh, I found those who 
resembled them, but they turned out to be scarecrows.  So, I 
turned to the great `hDuhdah `ffor guidance. You see, Duhdah is 
this great big, somewhat overweight guy with an elephants head 
and a dozen arms each holding something. One hand has 
cheese, one has wisdom, one has golf clubs, another holds the 
world (this is a rather small hand, for the world is not that 
important) and so on. He taught to me that I must stop looking for 
my parents in the outside world and start looking within. I told him 
he was full of it. He bonked me on the head a few times and I 
apologized. The bonking also showed me what I was to look for! 
These three little elephants appeared and started to talk to me! I 
mean, this is a real godly thing! Never see this kinda stuff outa the 
other boring gods like Neshajh or whoever those goody goodys 
follow. I mean, real life hallucinations! I hit the jack pot this time! 
Heck, these little guys could even posses my hands and stomach 
whenever they wanted to talk. I mean like tottally awesome! 
Course, Duhdah also gave me his wisdom and his holy aura and 
even offered me a few magazine subscriptions. I passed on the 
subscriptions, nothing that interesin in them. 
   
`eSo now I wander the realms, me little elephant buddies keeping 
me company as I walk. Things couldnt be more cool, cept that 
Duhdah keeps on possesing me to talk to the rest of the people, 
and that the hands seem out to kill me.. and my stomach just 
keeps grumbling. But hey, it could be worse.. right?``
