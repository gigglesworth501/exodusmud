Vers 5
Desc This human has a medium build. He has shoulder-length blonde hair and
gentle blue eyes. His face is almost elfin and is unscarred by lines of
age or battle.A smile is always on his face, reflecting the smile in his eyes.
Still, Talin's  persona seems almost artificial, as if something lay far
beneath the surface.

Plan  The story of Talin Dametraz
Cecil Davonshire was born in the small hamlet of Freedale. He had a
healthy childhood, full of bumps, bruises, and fun. He displayed a certain
knack for fighting early on, and spent many a day training with a wooden sword
made for him by his father. When Cecil was a yong man, a paladin from the Order
of Paladine passed through the village, stopping to stay at the local inn.
Cecil's father owned the inn where the paladin stayed. Cecil spent the day
listening to the paladin tell stories. The next morning, Cecil packed travelling
clothes, kissed his parents goodbye, and set off with the paladin to
enter the order.
Cecil trained long and hard, devoting many years to not only physical
perfection, but spiritual as well. Eventually he became a palad and married
a girl from his hometown. He was made Lord of a few acres of land in Caer
Darrow. 
Some years later, the High Priest of the Order died. A new priest was
appointed after the old one was burned on a pyre. The new priest was corrupt,
though no one knew it.
Cecil's wife, Lucrecia, was called in to give confession one night,
not the usual night for confession. He hypnotized her and seduced her.
Cecil returned home that night and found a note from Lucrecia, saying
that she had gone to the High Priest for confession. He set out to find her.
What he found was the High Priest, deep in the throas of passion with a
hypnotized Lucrecia. In righteous rage, he drew his holy avenger and slew the
corrupt priest. By chance, some of the other knights had stopped by the Temple
that night and heard the terrifying death scream of the priest.  They burst
through the door and found the priest dead and Cecil's sword wet with his
blood. Cecil gave himself up, telling the whole story.
Lucrecia related how she had come to the Temple and the priest had hypnotized
her. Cecil's story had been proved true. Still, the others knew that if the
common folk found out that the High Priest had been corrupt and evil, that
they would lose faith in the Order of Paladine. They needed a lamb, a
scapegoat. Someone to punish to keep up appearances. They found Cecil.
Cecil was tried by his other knights in a public trial and found
guilty. He was sentenced to execution. He was enclosed in the Temple the
night before his execution to pray to Paladine.
Cecil Davonshire, Paladin, went into the Temple. Talin Dametraz,
Bard, came out. At first the knights suspected that Cecil had escaped, but
Talin's face was the same as Cecil's, just ten years younger. None of the
knights could understand what had happened. They questioned Talin at length
about Cecil, but he could never recall knowing any Cecil, "though my travels
have taken me far and wide!". The Temple was locked and guarded. How could
Cecil have escaped and this bard gotten in? Had Cecil gone mad and turned
into this foolish bard? The knights were faced with a sobering realization.
Divine Intervention! To protect Cecil from persecution, Paladine must have
buried the real Cecil deep within his own mind and released Cecil's hidden
consciousness, his other self..The person each of us truly wants to be,
even as we are someone else. A strong arguement for Divine Intervention was
that Cecil's eyes were green, and Talin's were blue!
Lucrecia went mad shortly after. The Order of Paladine, shamed by the
knowledge of what they jad done, and how they had angered Paladine, released
TAlin, pointing him away, far away, to the distant city of Thesden. Talin,
happy as could be, with no knowledge of who he really was, began his long
journey to Thesden, whistling a tune as he went.
