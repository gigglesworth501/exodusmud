Bcry  uglieness always wins~
Plan  Once a long time ago there was a child who was born of dwarven heritage
p,pride and dwarven humor.  Of course the one thing he prides himself on is
the helping of others and he humors himself on being the ugliest dwarf alive
but all in all he is ussally helping people.  Sadly there are player killers
and thiefs who he does not much like.  He believes the only fair way to pk
is in a arena and thies should only attack mobs and steal from monsters.  So
in the future he hopes to help people and find more of his kind.
