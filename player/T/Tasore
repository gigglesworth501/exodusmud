Plan  A few years back, when Tasore and his twin sister Lisara were still
young, they were seperated from each when there family was slaughtered by
Vro'ath slave traders.  It was a terrible tradgedy, for only Lisara escaped
unharmed and Tasore was left for dead after being struck on the head. 
Fortunatly an old monk happened along and found tasore, half dead and
unconcious.  The priest was a kind old man and took Tasore to his monestary
where he nursed Tasore back to health.  After his recovery Tasore remained
at the monestary, assuming all of his family was dead and gone.  There he
learned the ways of peace and the ways of God.  To the monks there, Vro'ath
raids were constant, so many of these weaponless monks practiced the art of
unarmed combat which they also taught to tasore.  As Tasore reached
adult-hood he grew restless and adventuresome, so the monks granted him
permission to leave the abbey and possible explore and gather knowledge of
the surrounding land.  Tasore wandered far indeed, and finally came to
Thesden where he was reunited with his sister Lisara, and has now taken up
residency.
