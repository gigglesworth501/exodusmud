Vers 8
Desc Hovering before you, you see a youthful Sprite, probably in his mid 20's. His
face appears expressionless, showing no emotion, only his eyes mirror his true
soul. They mirror a sense of peace, understanding and a deep, heart-felt sor-
row.  He shows no signs of anger like most of his brethen, and only seeks 
solitude and understanding.  His close are simple, and shows no sign of wealth,
they hang about his thin, fragile frame showing as much emotion as his face.

Pass TeceaEYiUmBPc~
Plan  Traveling upon the long road back to Thesden, many thoughts ran through
Teclis's mind.  He thought about the way things were and the way things are,
but mainly he thought about the way things will be.  He was returning home
from a journey north where he had passed the once fair city of Eunyuel which
now lays in ruin conquored by Vro'ath shock troops.  He saw them and pitied
them, seeing how wrong they were to destroy in the names of false gods and
fought pointlessly to no real cause or end.  He had hoped to find peace and
calm back at his home, but only found as much chaos as he did in the north,
only it was by his own clan.  He recalled the words of Auvyron and how their
goal to enlighten not to destroy.  Amounst his clan he found many of the
followers had deserted the the faith, and those who remained now only seeked
personal gain at the cost of others.  Though his people were not a
charitable people it was not their way to thoughtlessly kill as he saw his
own clan doing.  He knew this pointless slaughter against others only drove
them further away from the true path and the word of Auvyron...

ExDe gloves~ These gloves have been made from the finest and smoothest satin material,
a beautiful feeling on the hands.  They do not look like they were made for
very difficult labor, they are showpieces to be sure.
