Vers 8
Desc `cYou gaze upon Pontius, a dwarf from a far off land. He looks at the `gsky`c,
`calmost as if he is lost in thought. You sense he is different from any 
`cother dwarf you have met. The `jcloak `cwrapped around him gives no detail into 
`chis figure. As you look up toward his head, you notice a kindness in his 
`cface. His mouth is curved in a small smile. When he notices you looking at 
`chim, he turns his head to face you, his smile widening. You then notice his 
`cstrange eyes. The c`bo`el`ko`gr``s `cslowly changing like the movement of the seasons. 
`cThe look of tangled emotions reside in those foreign eyes. You are about to 
`cspeak when his focus turns back to the `gsky`c.

Bcry  screams, '`cFor honor and goodness``'~
Plan  `cTickling winds from afar
Dancing, singing songs anew.
Joy unending lifts from the ground
To those who would know it too.
There is so much growth and light
Here around those who would not know it
Because they think too much of what they like.
`c
It is a hope beyond the dreams of material men.
It is a Light too great to comprehend.
It is a joy, a pain, an everylasting drain
Upon the hearts of whom it reaches.
It is more than what is expected.
It is greater than what is needed.
But it only comes to those who are waiting.
`c
Look out young adventurers
Who seek treasures of gold and silver.
For the true richness in life lies not in these
But in greater upon greater things.
More pure than the purest of gold.
More bright than the most polished of rings.
It is beyond the thoughts of mortal men
But rather lies in the souls of those who wait.

ExDe cloak~ This cloak is a deep forest green that flows loosely inside its frame of
golden trimmings.  A small emblem has been weaved into the cloak, a series
of diagonal and vertical slashes that are meaningless to you.
