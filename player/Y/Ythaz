Vers 5
Desc Ythaz looks abnormally tall for a dwarf.  Also, his beard is kind of thin,
despite his youthful appearance.  He also seems more comfortable around
humans and elves than most dwarves you have met.

He has steely-blue eyes, sandy-brown hair, a few scars on his face, arms,
and legs, and large calloused hands.  He walks with a slight limp.

Bcry  wearily raises his weapon to kill another living thing.~
Plan  Ythaz is not your typical dwarf.  Killing makes him sad.  After all, what is
the point of ending another creature's life just to become a better killer?
Sometimes for no explicable reason he may encounter a bout of sadness.  He
may need a bit of support from his friends during this time, but he does get
over it.  Usually when he is feeling this way, a small incident may set him off.
There are often signs he is feeling down.  Sometimes you can tell by looking at
him.  Other times he may stare at his feet abnormally.  Or he may treat combat
like a punishment, ignoring his abilities to overbear and kick
his opponents.  Maybe it is just too lonely for him, always killing.
Perhaps more wisdom and experience will give Ythaz the means to deal with this
conflict he feels within himself, but perhaps not.  Only time will tell.
