Vers 7
Desc A tall elven female stands before you.  She is about 7' 6" with more than
1/2 of her height being her legs.  She has many oddities for even an elf. 
One being she has catlike ears utop her head.  Another is that her peircing
blue eyes have a vertical pupil, looking very catlike.  She has blue hair
arranged into a long, thick braid going down to her ankles.  At the end of
the braid is a thick golden hoop.  She also has a tail covered in black fur
protruding from her.  She is very thin and her fingernails have black nail
polish on them.  Her knuckles are enlarged as if she might have claws too...
She is very cute, beautiful even.  She has three swords buckled in an
asterisk pattern in sheaths on her back.
