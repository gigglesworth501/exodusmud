Plan  Once there was a very young boy, who was taken from his parents at
an early age. The townspeople took him to the Asylum on the hill
to make sure the boy could not damage anyone. He was put in a straightjacket
and put into a darkened cellar with only a small, barred window high above
him and the rats to keep him company. If the boy was not CrAzY when he entered
the Asylum, then he was surely being tortured. The screams at night, from the
other "patients" in this place would have been punishing on a young mind.
As time grew on, the "doctors" gave him new types of medicine that they thought
may help his young mind from becoming aggrivated, but the medicines were not
tested on anything, just given straight to the boy. Now, if you stop and think
about this, medicines that have not been proven safe, given to an already fractured
mind.. This would compromise the integrity of the mind.. These "doctors" kept trying
new medicines, gradually increasing the dosage. They found the boy had started talking
to himself too.. They listened and observed they boy as he talked about plans of
getting out of 'this hellhole' with himself. The doctors gave him more and more of
these new medicines, gradually, they boys mind was weakening.. The boy was in the
cellar for 12 years, until the age of 19.. One day, the doctors came to talk to
him, and he seemed so normal to them, they released him. The young man then travelled
far far away from that place, to accross the seas. On his way, the ship he was
travelling on, got caught in a terrible storm and he was shipwrecked. He hit his
head off a rock while in the water, and started being dillusional. The young man
would never be cured of his ailment, he was destined to see and talk to things that
are not there.. Or are they? He also believed that there was another, living in his
own body... The story does not end here though, he lives out his life in his new home
where he occasionally talks to the other inside him.. And the young man's name?
Well... you should know... You're looking at him right now...
