Bcry  shortly draws his short dagger.~
Plan  `jShorty comes from a short line of short lived humans.  Rumors that a
dwarf impregnated his ancestry have plagued his entire life.  He does seem
to have more constitution than your average human bard.  Anyway, after years
of living in exile on a small island in the deepest uncharted part of the
ocean he decided to take a stab at civilization.  For fear of the ridicule
he had known all of his life, Shorty trained in the art of entertainment,
and became a very charismatic and likeable guy.  He essentially left his
shameful heritage behind and turned his back on all that he had known.  This
experience has taught him to embrace change and always seek a better way of
life.  This causes him to have a very short attention span, and many short
lived friends.  Shorty will help you out if you need it, but don't expect
any loyalty or undying friendship.  Maybe Shorty is a fool, or maybe a thief
at heart, but essentially, he is just an outcast.  His lack of conviction
and dedicated neutrality make him one who can do anything but really wants
to do nothing He has no Pride, and as an outcast, that characteristic
isolates him from all.  Pity Shorty!
