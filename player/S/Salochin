Plan  Salochin was once a young bard, but as the relm grew dumber, he grew older.
He didn't get dumber, he didn't get better, he just got older.  Perhaps it was while
he was sitting around picking his nose and listening to the other useless arguments
held between other people, or maybe it was because there was nothing else better for
him to do than just sit around and watch the sun go UP... and then down.  As Salochin
grew older, things began to change.  At first Salochin tried to change with them, but
then he got lazy of course, cause he was too interested in picking his nose.  Salochin
has now realized that he is not so young anymore, so he needs to get some fun while
he still can.  Fortunately, his idea of fun is different than most others, so that
gives him even more pleasure as he constantly annoys the other characters of the world.
He has decided he feels the most pleasure from death, so he has made it his
goal to kill everyone on the mud at least once.
