Bcry  flys into to battle to kill the monkey-haters.~
Plan  Schlinko comes from a world unto to everyone except those in it. He was living 
peacefully in his home town with the rest of the Flying Monkey's when he woke up one
day in the realm of Exodus.  Some freak mage had summoned him here, but ran away in
fright for having done so, so that mage is still at large.  Schlinko stood up and 
looked at his new surroundings.  He knew he would have to change his life dramatically
to survive.  He decided to train as a Warrior, but he kept the knowledge from his past
adventures as a flying monkey, which made him an even better warrior.  He one day 
hopes to seek out the incompetent mage who accidently summoned him to Exodus and force
that mage to send him back to his home land with the other flying monkeys.  Right now,
as he is gaining the skills necesarry to seek out that mage, he yearns to have a group
to belong to that will help him in his quest.  Others shun him for being a flying 
monkey.  He asks for help, and no one answers.  He tries to give help, and others only
poke at him or roll around on the ground laughing hysterically.  Other come and steal
his kills, or cast Quiet Mountain Lake on him like he is transluscent, yet he is
really here.  He yearns for a group of similar people who will understand his
feelings, and help him along the way.  He yearns for others to help him gain Pride.
`kHe walks around town, and the commoners ignore him or toss him a coin like he is a
filthy beggar.  He feels hurt and dejected, needing a group of friends to cheer him up
and give him Pride.
