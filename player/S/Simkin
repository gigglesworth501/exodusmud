Bcry  disappears, and suddenly a broom appears, whacking his foe upon t~
Plan  This cherry man in front of you is a complete mystery.  He is, for the
moment, clad in loud silks that, you must admit, are quite fashionable.  At
a moments notice however, he could snap his fingers and change his entire
attire.  Or, he might simply disappear and be replaced by a simple object,
like a teapot or a broom.  He rambles on about some place you've never heard
about, called Merlion, and about a few adventures with some Prince of
Darkness that he and a few friends had.  His story always ends with the
tragic fulfillment of a bizarre prophacy of some kind, and of his vain
attempt to flee the land before it was fulfilled.  You hear, as he prattles
on, forever adjusting the white lace at his blouse cuffs, about a man called
the Executioner, and how Simkin supposedly died by his hands.  You doubt
this however, since this annoying, know-it-all is right in front of you now,
relating a tale of how the Third Dutchess of Braxmillion was dreadfully
hauled off by the Emperor for yelling "Fire!"  In the middle of the crowded
town square.  Terrible story, very sad.  But Simkin seems not to mind,
snapping his fingers and again changing his attire, and skipping off to
another end of the world.

ExDe cheating~ `l* DO NOT multiplay.  You may have multiple characters, but in NO WAY
may they be on at the same time or assist one another in any way.  This
includes leaving eq or money for your alternate or summoning someone so your
alter may kill them.  * DO NOT use a client in a fashion that gives a player
an undue advantage.  Use of a client is not illegal, but the creation of
"Bots" is illegal.  * DO NOT lie to the immortal staff.  If you are found to
be lying, you will be punished.  * DO NOT abuse bugs.  If you find a bug,
report it immediately.  * DO NOT EVER mess with arena gear in any way,
shape, or form.  Wear it for the duration of your duel, do not experiment on
it.  * DO NOT store personal items in a store.  If you don't want to sell
it, don't keep it there.  * DO NOT use stores to sell or store runes.  This
can result in loss of all stock and/or deletion.  * DO NOT mask "spoofs" or
variations on a storekeeper's name while you are in that store.  This
includes both mob and player storekeepers.  Spoofs on player names are
allowed outside of this instance provided that the first two letters of the
spoof-name are different from the real name of the player.  Immortals are
not to be spoofed without their permission.  Pet names must also follow
these rules.  * Do not steal from the persons or corpses of noclans or
newbies.  This includes using charm and making them drop everything.  It is
LEGAL to steal from noclan homes, however, as there is nothing to indicate
noclan status.  If they catch you or can prove you did it, a noclan can sue
for harassment to get their stuff back.  Clanned or loner characters cannot
do so.  * DO NOT accept or ask for favors from immortals.  The immortal
staff will assist you in many ways, but they may not help in a manner that
is not available to other players.  Favors include requests for information
that would not normally be available to you, requests for experience or
equipment, requests for special reimbs of prohibited items (runes, enchants,
etc) and so on.  * DO NOT use inherent world characteristics in order to
directly kill or rob anyone.  You also may not use them to kill mobs.  * DO
NOT use character actions (such as charm) to force players to use their
player level commands, such as alias, save, etc or to change a player's
characteristics, such as align, against their will.  * DO NOT claim that
linkdead means you have their permission to do anything to them.  It
doesn't.  * If you are punished by an immortal do not attempt to evade your
punishment.  You may appeal a judgment you feel is unfair, however, if your
appeal is turned down, that is the end of the matter.  Talk to staff to find
out who to appeal to.  If you escape from the wanted flag caused by
autojailing, that is OK.  Once you are in jail, escaping is illegal.  *
Vro'ath may not group with anyone other than other Vro'ath, and evil or
neutral humans or dwarves.  
~
ExDe harrassment~ `l* DO NOT social or emote characters that have asked you to stop.  * DO
NOT lock Sidhe in combat spam.  * DO NOT send repeated tells or telepaths to
players who do not wish to speak with you.  * DO NOT continue to argue with
an immortal after they have said their judgement is final You may appeal
through the correct channels, but if you are turned down, you may not
continue to harass staff with the issue.  DO NOT social the immortal staff
without clear permission, especially not with insulting or sexually oriented
socials.  DO NOT attempt to kill them, steal from them, charm them, bardsong
or cast spells upon them without that immortal's specific permission. 
`iHarrassment based on race, creed, nationality, religion, sexual
preference, or gender of any player will be punished severely.  `lIf you are
in someone's private rooms and they ask you to leave, do so or they can
charge you with trespassing (a form of harassment) in court.  `` 
~
ExDe overview~ `n&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&
`hThere are four major categories of offense that will get you in trouble in
the Realm of Exodus.  These are enforced directly by an immortal or through
a court of law in cases when an immortal has not made a judgment on the
matter.  If you are charged with any of the following, you may hire an
attorney to defend you if it goes to court (see HELP COURTS).  While `iyou
MUST read all the rules and obey them`h they have been separated into
different sections based on the type of offense.  These categories are :
`kIllegal Player Killing (LOOK PK), Harrassment (LOOK HARRASSMENT), Cheating
(LOOK CHEATING), and Channel Abuse (LOOK CHANNEL).  `n
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%IMMORTALS%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
`hThe immortal staff is here to help maintain a quality mud.  If it is not
in direct violation of a clearly stated rule, you are expected to comply
with their request.  Not all rules are explicitly stated in this rule list,
and they may be enforcing a rule not listed here.  If you have a problem
with that request or with a punishment you have been given, discuss the
matter privately with that immortal or another immortal staff member.  Imm
staff will also listen to your ideas for change here at the mud, and you are
encouraged also to talk to player council members about proposed changes. 
If you suspect an immortal of wrongdoing, privately talk to that immortal or
another immortal about the issue.  Have some kind of proof (ie at least an
example).  Public allegations waste everyone's time.  
~
ExDe pk~ `hPK OUTSIDE OF CLANS`l Player murder outside of the realm of clans or
guilds is frowned upon in the lands of Exodus, and killing a person who is
not a/a loner or b/in a clan and c/equal to or over level 9 is illegal. 
Losing your temper because the noclan or newbie was annoying is not
considered an acceptable defense.  `iNote:`lIf you are not in a clan or are
not already marked loner, you will receive the loner distinction if you kill
somebody or attempt to steal from other players.  Other offenses that will
earn you a loner flag are charming (spell or song), sleeping, or teleporting
other players or looting their corpses.  A good rule of thumb is to only
talk to other players in the game, and not use your abilities on them unless
a/you are aiding them at their request or b/you want to become a loner. 
Spelling up group members for a battle is acceptable, but otherwise you
should not sing, pray, enspell, or in any way use your abilities to affect
other players unless they so request it.  If you are a noclan, make sure
your autoassist is mob only or you WILL retain your loner flag if you kill
another player. 
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< `lPK
`oIN A CLAN OR AS A LONER `lIf you are in a clan or are a loner, there is no
such thing as an Out of Level (OOL) kill down with the exception of newbies,
but note that if you kill someone more than 8 levels OOL, you will lose a
tremendous amount of experience - the greater the level difference, the
greater your loss.  Players grouped with you at the time of your murder will
also be punished in the same fashion, though they may or may not be able to
appeal that.  Murdering a player who is participating in an immortal run
quest is forbidden, even in times of clan war, unless otherwise directly
specified by the immortal in charge of the quest.  Attacking a player
participating in such a quest who is marked as being part of a quest group
("quest" in title) will be punished.  Use of the quest immunity to abuse
other players will result in the usual punishment plus loss of quest prizes.
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
`oNEWBIE PROTECTION`l Do NOT attack or pk any level 8 or lower, FOR ANY
REASON.  Even if the level 8 or lower is in a clan or loner, they are NOT TO
BE ATTACKED.  Noclan rules apply to even clanned or loner newbies.  If a
newbie abuses this protection, let the imms know and/or sue for
harassment.???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????? 
- ??????  `oINDIRECT PK `lKilling players using summon, aggressive monsters,
or any other indirect means is a very severe offense and punishable by
freezing, in most cases.  Because they may kill noclans or newbies, plague,
Good Vibrations, and earthquake may not be used within Thesden or any other
area designated as a starting city should there be some in the future.  No
charming (spell or song), sleeping, or teleporting, or using your abilities
on the persons or corpses of noclans or newbies in any manner other than
with the consent of the noclan or newbie. 
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
`oMultikilling`l Killing another player several times in succession without
an adequate time lapse between kills is illegal.  Typically, an adequate
time lapse means enough time for them to recover their items and
health/mana.  
~
ExDe channel~ ****************************CHANNEL ABUSE*******************************
`lDo NOT spam on any channel (repeating the same action to cause scroll). 
This includes emotes and actions in the same room, or forcing another player
to spam themselves.  Spells are included: Feeding yourself is ok, but
spamming create food 30 times is not, if you are in devon square or another
room with players.  DO NOT use channels for purposes other than those for
which they were designed.  This includes using OOC for in-character
communications or to berate other players.  None of our public channels are
to be used as forums for personal arguments or prolonged discussions.  `hDo
not use any public channel for insults, epithets, or profanity.  `lDO NOT
make public private conversations between yourself and an immortal.
