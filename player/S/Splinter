ExDe papermsg~ `bOver my numerous years of playing here, and being banned here ive broken a few rules in my time. This is just a book about them, its not meant for people to use to learn how to cheat..
`bNo.. not at all, this is so that people can learn from my mistakes.
`o 1. Ok well if there is anything that you should know about cheating, the first thing you do before you try any of this is to ask for an imm OOC, if no imm answers your possibly in the clear, this isnt guaranteed, but it works atleast 70% of the time.
`o 2. `bTricky Spamming `k- `oNow this ia little trick ive learned over the years, its not spamming per say, atleast its not illegal, you see spamming is when you use a spell or skill 10 times in a row, without having any meaning for it besides getting t
`ohe percentage of it up, now if you use one skill 10 times, say hide, instead of hiding 10 more times, use sneak 10 times. then hide 10 more times.. etc. therefore making it not illegal
`o 3. `bAngering an Immortal `k- `oHere is a little something that ive picked up over the years, the imms here just like in greek times arent perfect, they have human characteristics, and are actually more liable to anger then say me or you, perhaps due 
`o to the stress of being an immortal, make a list of extremely long and hard words you will use in the conversation that the imm probaly wont understand, this always gets a rise from an immortal, prove the immortal wrong, 
`onothing gets under a immortals skin more then proving him wrong, they think that they are the gods they should always be correct, lastly do something illegal and find a trick for getting around it, like picking your own alts eq up from donations. which
`o i will explain later in this journal
`o 4. `bGetting your own EQ from donations when Jailed `k- `oThis is a tricky little loophole ive concocted lately since ive been in jail so much, once you get jailed, switch alts and get your own eq from donations. When stopped by an immortal
`ojust calmly state that eq in donations is anyones equipment and that your not planning on giving the eq back to your jailed alt, so therefore making it not illegal, then on ooc ask a friend you trust if he would like to buy some cheap eq
`oHe says yes, so you sell him your alts eq, then you log on your alt, and ask if anyone has any eq for sell, cause someone looted yours, your friend says yes and sells your own eq back to you, but in a legal way, nice huh?
`o 5. `bDouble Killing `k- `oOk this one really seems to anger the imms, so its a good one to do, what you do is get a alt that can summon and a friend to go into a room with no exits, summon someone and let your friend kill them, make sure you dont atta
`ock him, then ask if he needs a summon back to his EQ.. if he says yes then he agrees that you can summon him back to his corpse, and then since you havent attacked him, you can kill him, non illegaly. 
`o 6. `bIndirect Pk `k- `oHere is a little interesting loophole ive discovered, if a newbie annoys you start being nice to him, and tell him you want to show him a really cool leveling spot, he of course says yes, you ask him to follow you, quickly walk 
`oing to a place like.. shale or even into the ocean, then apologize on OOC, now this isnt illegal because you were going to take him to say.. linden, someplace a newbie can really go to level
`ohis eq is "lost" in the ocean, because you kept walking.. no harm no foul, except to the dead newbie.
`o 7. `bFree Restrings `k- `oI love this one, its totally invented by me, and i have done it quite a few times... ok its this easy, get an imm to do you a restring, then type this *emote gives you 600 gold* the imm thinks he gets the money, and you get a
`o free restrings, everyones happy
`o*`kThis also works for player rooms, and ale fountains etc`o*
`o8. `bRune Hunting `k- `oNow this one I unfortunately havent had a chance to try, but ive seen a few success stories with it, the first thing you do, is get a low level immortal to vnum runes, when you find one on a player you log on your decent mage al
`ot kill the person, and steal his rune, although this has been a bit more limited after nopk protection, i have no doubt some imms still practice this today, gee my eyes are getting dry `b*`kBlink`b*
`o 9. `bPaladin Ownage `k- `oNow im not sure this is really cheating, but this really is the ultimate revenge on a paladin you hate, all you need is 10 deconsecrate/deconsecrate parchies and your character needs the skill scrolls

ExDe papermsg~ `oNow just wait for the unsuspecting paladin to go afk, walk into his room and recite all the scrolls on him, now guess what, the paladin has lost all of his prayers for good.. sucks for him huh? the best thing about this is that you can even screw over 
`o no-pk shit talkers with it, and it isnt even illegal yet. nice eyy?
`o 10. `bCrashing and Duping `k- `oThis seems to be a really touchy subject to imms, I still am not sure why heh, I still have alts banned from 6 months ago when i did this, but its a fairly simple thing to do
`oyou have to find a bug on exodus that crashes the mud, this is the hard part, make sure no imms are on when attempting this, when you finally find one, you go to a room with a box
`ofirst thing you do is save, then you remove all and spam put 1. box then you use your bug you found to crash the mud, when the mud comes back up you should have two copies of your eq, one on you and one in the box.
`oNow you have to be careful with your duped eq, if an imm all the sudden sees that the mud has crashed 5 times, and you have 30 paladin lances (an real example from me) they get suspicios, and then your screwed
`oand another thing, duping runes is bad, runes all have a certain vnum, to prevent them from being copied, if you get lots of runes, cash them all in asap! or put them in a store. so you dont get caught
