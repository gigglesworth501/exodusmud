Vers 7
Desc Stryke is a disturbed young man.
He mostly keeps to himself
he observes his society in a philosophical way.
A very thin man with a sickly white complexion.
Perhaps not as mischievous as other thieves, but takes other risks to earn his stereotype.
 His short flowing rich brown hair hangs over one eye and he stays mostly to the walls with his chin tilted slightly down.
 Obviously, he does not look like a man that is looking for a friendly 'hello.'
It would take a witty icebreaker to get him to talk.
He walks around this world as an alternative to suicide.
