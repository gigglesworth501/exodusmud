Vers 7
Desc `aDressed in a black robe edged in`k gold`a, runic writing, Stormchild watches
`ayou through skeptical, distrustful, red eyes.  She holds a non-descript staff
in her long-nailed hand, and although at first it does not appear that she could
do much damage with it, a second glance at the rippling muscles of her forearms
buldging out of the sleeves of her clerical robe tell another story.
Finally deciding to smile at you at last, she shows off her set of small, 
evenly spaced`o ivory colored fangs`a.

`i At an early age, it was realized in my village that I was a gifted child in that the
great God Ne'Shajh, may He reign supreme over all of the other lesser gods for all
eternity, blessed me with the gift of answering my prayers.  The elders of the
village recognized this and I was sent to the caves in the mountains to learn
more about the Almighty Ne'Shajh, may all honor His greatness.  Through the years
I became further adept in my prayers.  At last, one fateful day, I was approached
by the leader of our group and was told that I must go out on my own into the
world and seek out Ne'Shajh, to whom the heavens sing eternal praises, so that He
might take my life as a blood sacrifice in His great name.  My quest to further
inspire my mighty people in the devotion of Ne'Shajh, of whom I can never be
worth, has just begun in addition to my search to give myself over to the Almighty
and Supreme.``
