Vers 8
Desc Thick waves of blue-black hair have been pulled back into an
artfully woven braid, held in place by a thin strap of black
leather.  Only a thin stripe of white hair, which stands in
shocking contrast, reveals that this woman may be older than
she appears at first glance.  A slight point to her small ears
and an exotic tilt to her deep violet eyes, indicate a distant
strain of elven heritage.  Her lips are full and slightly wide,
giving her the appearance of someone who smiles often.  The 
kiss of the sun has left a light smattering of freckles over
her small, slightly upturned nose, and given her skin a healthy
radiant glow.

Plan  I can barely remember my early days in Thesden, so long ago it was when I
arrived within the city walls.  It was my first time in an actual city, as I
recall, having spent my earlier years being raised within the woodlands.  My
father was a ranger, and passed down his knowledge to me.  I never met my
mother, though my father spoke of her often.  She had given me to my father
to raise, fearing the scandal that a half-elven child would bring to her
people and to her daughter, my half sister, Cenairre.  And so my father
raised me as best as he could, though there were times when I know he looked
at me and saw my mother's eyes.  I knew it must have hurt him greatly.  When
I was merely 17, my father was slain by a group of Vro'ath slavers who had
attempted to abduct me while I was out gathering fruits and herbs near our
small cabin.  I fled quickly through the Fiernese, until I came to the
western gates of Thesden.  It was certainly overwhelming to me, but with the
help of some friends, I learned to adjust.  I met a group of people, who as
a group were known as 'GreenWood', and I joined their number.  After a few
years of growing and learning and befriending many people, I married another
member of the GreenWood clan.  He was a handsome man who treated me kindly,
though he was much more powerful than I.  I attribute our divorce to my
youth and impetuous nature.  I became angry with him over something -- I was
abducted by Morghiel, a Vro'ath and the leader of Varruk at the time.  I
knew that his intention was to sell me into slavery.  I was terrified.  I
waited for days, knowing that my husband would rescue me.  Days passed, and
nothing.  I was to be 'auctioned' off to the highest bidder, and I by the
time I had discovered this, I had no hope left.  Within the slave pen, I
befriended a strange half-vro'ath named Draven.  I could tell that he wished
to hate me, to harm me...  But he did not.  Instead, his curiosity of me got
the better of him, and he learned to accept me, and eventually love me.  He
freed me from his brother Morghiel's grasp by being the highest bidder at
auction, and perhaps the strangest love story of Thesden's history
commenced.  We were ridiculed and despised by many...  And though we became
the parents of a lovely son, Andraste, we never married.  I suppose even the
greatest love has difficulty withstanding the prejudice of others, and for
reasons that only the gods are aware of, we drifted apart.  I left Thesden,
confused and very much heartbroken.  I felt as if I had failed in so many
ways in my life.  I had failed Loric and Draven and Andraste and myself,
most of all.  I found the old abandoned cottage in the Fiernese, the one I
had shared with my father, restored it and lived there for many years,
contemplating constantly my life in Thesden, wondering how I might have done
things better.  I spent some time with my sister, who found that though I
had little talent with magic, that I was actually a fair musician and poet. 
It took some time to get up the nerve to find a tutor, but I did so, and
poured my heart and soul into music.  I poured all the anger and failure and
disappointment into the music, and found it to be a wonderous elixir for all
my ills.  And so now, I return to Thesden -- many of the people I once knew
and loved have moved on, though I hope that I have learned well from the
lessons taught to me in my adventures, and that this time around I will do
things the right way.  Denarra RavenWing, Woodland LoreSeeker.
