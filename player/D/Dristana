Bcry  `ohops around `jshouting `iPlay with me!!!!``~
Plan  `aEvery day, she would look more haggard.  She wasn't eating, she wasn't 
sleeping.  I could hear her heart beating slower and slower.  Finally, 
she walked out into the prairie, and just gave up.  I watched her lie 
down, and so badly did I want to go to her and tell her I was there.  
But she wouldn't have known me, she would have rejected me, so I 
couldn't do it.  I closed my eyes against the tears, and when I opened 
them, there was someone standing over her.  Someone that I didn't know. 
And suddenly, all I could smell was her blood.  Furious, I couldn't 
hold myself back anymore.  I ran to her, tearing the man who slit her 
throat into pieces.  I heard Verlayne crashing through the brush in her 
usual manner, swearing at me the whole time.  "FIX HER!" I screamed.  
She knelt over Lissi, praying.  I knelt on the other side of her, the 
tears no longer willing to be held back.  What had I done?
 
Verlayne's healing powers couldn't bring her back.  She was slipping 
even farther.  Verlayne started shouting at me, blaming this on me.  
And I knew she was right.  If only I hadn't gone with Yaohan... If 
only...  Verlayne wrenched Lissiana's body away from me, holding her 
twin tightly to her, sobbing.  I stood up, looking down at the 
beautiful woman that I had let die.  I felt useless, murderous, 
lethargic, empty.  What had I done?!
 
As I sat there cursing myself, and trying to figure out how I was 
supposed to live without her, her whole body grew rigid, then her head 
slammed back.  I saw the skin on her throat grow together, I heard her 
take a breath.  All I could do was stare.  Were my eyes playing tricks 
on me? When she cried out and sat up, my heart stopped beating.  I had 
heard tales of people being sent back from the other side.  I never 
thought I would see this... And the - things - growing out of her back.  
I couldn't tell what they were, but I knew it hurt.  Tears welled in 
her eyes as she writhed in pain.  Praying for mercy for her, I knelt 
down next to her, unable to do anything but stare... She was alive!
 
After she passed out, I picked her up and carried her home, Verlayne 
using every foul word in every language known to man on this earth.  I 
think there were a few in there I had never heard before.  I knew I 
deserved it, but I also vowed that never again would I leave her side.  
Not for any reason.  I sat down next to her on the bed, and there I 
stayed for 3 days and nights, not taking my eyes off of her beautiful 
face, except to look at the huge wings that were growing out of her 
back.  They were as black as her hair, and beautiful.
 
When she woke up, I was unprepared for what happened next.  The short, 
petite woman that I loved KNOCKED ME DOWN.  Kneeling over top of me, 
she slapped me so hard I could taste blood.  Then her lips pressed 
against mine...  
 
When we were both finally able to speak again, I explained to her what 
I was, what had happened to me.  I told her that I was always in the 
shadows, watching her. I could tell she was still furious with me, but 
at least she was alive.
 
After that, I never left her side again.  Never gone away from her for 
longer than an hour.  I can't stand it.  We have a beautiful daughter 
now.  She got my bloodlust and her Mother's good looks.  She's a better 
killer than I am, and that says a lot.  Verlayne is still around, but 
she spends most of her time out with Fyer.  Life is good.
