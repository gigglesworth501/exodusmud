ShD  Andrew~
LnD  Andrew, the squire to David Knight of Alliant stands here.~
Desc An elderly man appearing to be about the age of fifty or so stands here. 
Dispite the aged appearance of this knight he still seems as though he would
be a formitable opponant, for he looks as though he has grown very strong
under the teachings of his lord.  This man is also adorned in the vestments
of a Grand Knight in the noble Order of Alliant and you also notice that he
is adorning the robes of deputyship, and you realize that who you are
looking at is much more than he appears to be.

Bcry  yells "Prepare to meet my blade and thy maker!~
Plan  Hi.  I am David Cameron, Regent of Ebbon Downs, Deputy, and Grand Knight
of the Allinat order.  My story is a long and sorted one, which is too long
to complete tell to you in this discussion, but one that I would be glad to
tell to you if you are interested..  My life may not have been as difficult
as many of the other men and women who chose to follow the Order of the
Alliant.  I grew up in my father's castle, being trained to follow in his
footsteps, as a mighty lord and of a businessman.  My father never had me
learn the arts of war, but instead had me learn latin, greek, and
mathematics.  He never thought that I would ever have any use for such
'barbaric' things.  Oh, how he was wrong....  My life was one of gleeful
bliss until one cold wintery night.  I remember it like it was yesterday. 
My father had planed a banquet for all the othernobility, and even the king
and queen were supposed to join us.  As the guest's carraages arrived, and
the banquet hall filled, the castle came alive with people running around
making sure everything was in place.  I was in the kitchen talking with my
nanny, I was only six or seven years aof age at the time.  I was attempting
to help her with dinner, but I am affraid that I was more of a nusance than
anything else, though she never treated me as one.  All of a sudden we heard
the warning bell, it was a deep and hollow, it was a sound I had never heard
before, yet it still scared me.  I ran out of the kitchen, across the court
yard, and up the guard tower, to the top of the outside wall.  As I looked
down, over the wall, I saw these figures clad in all black, riding atop
black horses, grouped around this evil looking contraption.  This machine
looked as if it could lay siege to the castle all on it's own.  Black smoke
billowed from this machine, and we felt the wall tremble as it drove
through the castle gates as though they were not even there.  The men in all
black, flowed through the wound in the castle's frount.  This made me even
more scared, the little boy that I was, I ran and hid under my parent's bed.
I could hear the sound of horse's hooves as they trampled through the
castle, and I could hear the screams of people all around.  Then all of a
sudden the screaming stopped, and finally the sound of the horses died away,
though it was not until the next morning that I crawled my teary eyed body
out from under the bed.  As I looked aroung the castle, I saw dismembered
bodies everywhere, and it sickened me, but I had to continue looking, half
hoping I would find my parents, and half hoping I would not.  Sure enough, I
found them all right, in the banquet room, my father had been beheaded, and
my mother gored.  I knelt and cried.  That was the last time I ever remember
crying.  That night I left the castle, never to return, I wanted to forget
the entire incodent, putting that tragic memory behind me.  I hitchhiked
through the country, trying to come as far and as fast as I could.  I
eventually found my way to Thesden where I grew up as a rouge, and petty
thief.  Until one day, I was waiting right off the trade route, when I saw
it.  It was the same machine that had sieged the castle that fateful night. 
I was instantly filled with hatred, I had to know who and what these things
were, and I wanted to distroy every last one of them.  Through my endless
search for knoweledge, I learned of the Varruk, and their plan to distroy
the nobility of my land, take it's riches as spoils of war and the people as
slaves.  This search also led me to learn more about the eviler aspects of
life, and the more I learned the sicker, and more enraged I became.  Because
of this I turned my life around, and joined the noble Order of the Alliant,
where I vowed to stomp out evil where ever it may raise it's foul head. 
Since joining Alliant, I have grown powerful in the force of good, raising
in the ranks, and have even taken the pursuit of eradicating evil through
becomming a registered barrister of the lands.  Since joinint Alliant, I
have also prospered, as God and his angel Amber, look favoribly upon those
who chose the narrow path.  And finally, that brings us up to date.  Sorry
if my story was long but I couldn't have made it any shorter for you. 
Farewell, and Godspead....
