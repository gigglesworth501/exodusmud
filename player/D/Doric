Plan  Once there was a bard who spent his days and nights wandering around the
streets of Thesden, playing his songs for the people. Over the course of
several years, the people grew more and more hostile toward him as a sidhe.
They cursed him for his color and beliefs. They booed his music. As much as
he tried to impress them and win their favor, their cruelty would increase.
At first they started throwing chunks of meat at him. Then eventually they
began throwing stilettoes. The poor bard had to flee Thesden's limits. Many
grudges lingered in him. He travelled around the continent, developing his
fighting abilities. And every once in a while, he strikes swiftly at the
heart of Thesden, taking out his revenge on those who drove him away.
