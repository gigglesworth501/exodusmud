Vers 8
Desc A puzzle of a man stands here watching you.  His gaze seems friendly but
guarded.  He is taller than most men but not of too much note.  He is clean
shaven and well kempt, as if expecting some important encounter.  His
muscular stature betrays his work as a blade smith.  The holy symbol at his
belt shows his belief in a higher power.  The oddest thing about him is that
his right arm never swings when he moves it remains in place.  Almost like
an undrawn sword.  Dangerous but sheathed.  Maybe it has something to do
with the edges of the markings that can be seen peeking out from his glove.

Plan  THE ENIGMA CALLED DAX Born to a fanged-one mother and a religious human
father, his childhood was harsh.  But through the taunts and jeers of his
peers he stood fast with the support of his loving family.  When he became
able he started work in his father smith.  He learned the ways of creation
under the careful loving watch of his father.  He learned how to reveal the
beauty that lies within a mask of raw material.  He grew closer to his
father as they worked side by side.  Silent, but speaking a language that
never needed to be spoken.  As close as he was to his father he was closer
to his mother.  Though she born the marks of an accursed she was more human
than most.  Her love for her son was able to allow him to endure the
constant sting of the disapprovement of the world.  When he came of age and
was ready to accept the position that was awaiting him in life, it all
changed.  The elders demanded that he not accept the position that was to be
his.  That he would pervert the station with his birth and heritage. 
Something flared in his being.  An anger greater than any he had ever known.
An anger of outrage.  An anger of resentment.  An anger of righteousness. 
Who were they to question his heritage?  His lifestyle?  His birth?  His
family had given the most to them to try to gain acceptance.  And this is
what they recieved?  His sword, crafted over 16 years by his father for this
day, glowed white as he raised it to strike down the elders.  But he was
stopped by a single gaze.  The gaze of her.  The one who understood.  The
one who knew.  The one who was waiting.  And then it was over.  He gave the
elders their life that day, but gained and lost so much more.  He lost the
feeling of acceptance he had strived so long for.  But he knows that she is
out there.  She is waiting for him.  Ever since she left that day, he has
And then it was over.  He gave the elders their life that day, but gained
and lost so much more.  He lost the feeling of acceptance he had strived so
long for.  But he knows that she is out there.  She is waiting for him. 
Ever since she left that day, he has searched the world for her.  Maybe
someday soon he will find her.  Before his destiny finds him....
