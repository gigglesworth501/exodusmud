Vers 8
Desc A winged being of ectoplasm stands tall clutching his sword.  A slight
shade of silver-blue, Flar's height is almost that of a normal human
female, possibly making him the tallest sidhe ever to have lived.  He
is well equipped for battle, and his constant grinning shows how excited
he is to be the first sidhe reaver.  As he grins, his teeth that he's
filed to a sharp point tend to scare even the bravest souls, though
they are simply for show.  He has no use for his teeth in battle, for
the dexterity and mastery with which he wields his sword have yielded him
triumph after triumph over even the greatest of foes.

Plan  `jFlar`` began as a simple thought.  Many `aSidhe`` had begun wishing for a
special warrior `aSidhe`` to be born.  While the suppossed "gods" of the land
prohibited sidhe from becoming warriors, these few sidhe still hoped for it.
They knew that these so-called gods did not have as much power as they
thought, so they tried to think of other ways to realize their dream.
They began following the teachings of `iAuvyron``, the heretic mage, 
in secret to prevent persecution.  One particular `aSidhe``, `kAenima``,
took it upon himself to ask `iAuvyron`` for help in creating this special
warrior `aSidhe``.  `iAuvyron`` was insulted, thinking `kAenima`` too weak to
even bother listening to, so he attacked `kAenima``.  `kAenima``, having
learned a lot, both from his guildmaster and the teachings of `iAuvyron``,
killed `iAuvyron`` not once, but 10 times, in order to try and prove his
true worth.  `iAuvyron``, embarrassed at having been defeated so easily
so many times, finally listened to `kAenima's`` pleas.  `iAuvyron`` still
did not wish to help `kAenima``, so `iAuvyron`` gave him a quest to 
complete before he would offer his help.  `iAuvyron``, angry at the rumors
of `bKrathe`` insulting him, and unable to harm `bKrathe`` himself (due
in part to the long distance of `bKrathen`` from `iHell``, and in part
to the handmaiden's protection of `bKrathe``), devised this quest as a
way to rid himself of `kAenima``, and hopefully extract revenge upon
`bKrathe``.  `iAuvyron`` told `kAenima`` that if he managed to kill
`bKrathe`` 30 times, he would honor `kAenima's`` request.  `kAenima``,
unable to believe his good fortune in getting a true offer of help from
`iAuvyron``, quickly left to repeatedly slay `bKrathe``.  `kAenima`` got into
the rhythm of killing `bKrathe`` so much that he actually killed `bKrathe``
40 times before he stopped and went back to talk to `iAuvyron``.
`iAuvyron``, astounded by `kAenima's`` success, had no choice but to grant
the promise he made to `kAenima``.  In fact, `iAuvyron`` was so impressed
he created an entire class of warriors for `aSidhe``, giving them the option
for powerful spells also, and named his new class `eReavers``.  `kAenima``
was estatic about `iAuvyron's`` work, but apparently so were the so-called
"gods".  These "gods" noiced the superiority of this new `eReaver`` class, so
they allowed some of the inferior races the chance to also become `eReavers``,
but `kAenima`` did not care, for he knew `aSidhe``, as the chosen race, would
always make the best `eReavers``.  Thus `jFlar`` materialized, and became the
first `aSidhe`` to take advantage of this new class, thus making himself
the first official `aSidhe `eReaver``.
`jFlar's`` life went great..at first.  He quickly raised in both rank
and status among the `eReavers`` to become the top in the race to the
ultimate prestige.  Others noticed his glory, and many `aSidhe `eReavers
``were created in an attempt to become as powerful as `jFlar``.
Unfortunately for `jFlar``, he had become too powerful, too fast.  The
so-called "gods" took notice of `jFlar's`` greatness, and they deemed
him too powerful for this realm.  They devised a scheme not only to
destroy `jFlar``, but to destroy all `aSidhe `eReavers``, for all time.
`kAenima ``volunteered to go beg `iAuvyron`` for help, but `jFlar`` knew
there was nothing even `iAuvyron`` could do now, for it was too late.
The gods, in a pitiful attempt to appease the remaining `aSidhe``, gave
`jFlar`` a week before they would use their powers to destroy him.  What does
one do when they have but a week left to live?  `jFlar`` had few friends,
for `aSidhe`` tend to be solitary, and no family - in essence, `jFlar
``had no one to spend his remaining days with, and little to live for.
`jFlar`` became depressed, ignoring everyone else and refusing to talk
to anyone.  `jFlar`` decided he would make a last ditch effort to stay
on top of the other `eReavers``.  He spends his remaining days killing,
trying to regain the glory of his extremely brief past, but his heart
died the day his countdown to extinction began.
