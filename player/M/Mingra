Vers 6
Desc Mingra smiles at you, showing delicate fangs.  She is one of the very
few Vro'ath women to walk the realms.  Unlike male Vro'ath, her skin
is relatively smooth and her scent strangely pleasing.  Like most other
Vro'ath women, she is unconscious of or enjoys the the typical scent that the
male of her kind exudes.  A glinting medallion of Ne'Shajh hangs 
about her neck comfortably.  As she brushes a long, dark strand of hair
from in front of her eyes, your smile fades.  You somehow doubt that 
it would be a good idea to tell that Ne'Shajh joke in her presence, for it
has been said that the female is fiercer than the male ... and when
you met her eyes, you saw nothing of yourself or of Mingra reflected
in that darkness...only the burning flame of a reflection of Ne'Shajh.
You look away, before you can see more...or feel more of that scorching, 
frightening pain the shamaness bears proudly for her god.

Plan  A cool wind blows thick, dark hair over her eyes for a moment, and the
shamaness pauses to move it before she gives you her attention.  When her
eyes meet yours, you shiver, for no sign of Mingra can be seen there, only a
reflection of Ne'Shajh.  The Vro'ath woman has the strength and height of
her people, but she has an eerie presence, something about her that tells
you she cares little for this world.  Your question must have been reflected
in your eyes, and the Shamaness nods in silent understanding.  Darkness
begins with her voice as she tells a short story....  Once in the darkness
of our world, a young Vro'ath was born to a priestess of the great and
glorious evil that is Ne'Shajh.  The priestess offered the child, a
daughter, to Ne'Shajh, to be done with as the Evil pleased.  It was of great
amusement to the evil god to see how a mortal child would handle the strange
nether realms where he dwelt, and so he took the child, and a few others, to
that horrible place in which he dwelt..  Only one survived, and she was so
changed that she was no longer like the the others of her kind that walked
the mortal realms.  Honed and defined to the essential of her self, she is
Vro'ath and not-Vro'ath, her soul subsumed in the total willing and
delighted sacrifice of her soul to her god.  In the strange and distant
demonic plane she lived on, she was a zealot and fervent devotee' of
Ne'Shajh, who pretended her efforts were not amusing..  It was only after
the young shamaness ripped her own heart out and offered it as she died to
the evil god that he deigned to show his pleasure in her.  Resurrecting the
soul that attempted, even in the torment of the damned, to sacrifice to him,
he dropped her back on the plane where she was from, to win more to serve
him..  So it was that Mingra the Shamaness came to Thesden, and joined the
holy clan Teluk.  Although the clan has fallen, she continues on.  Those
that know the shamaness, however, know that her heart remains with
Ne'Shajh...
