ExDe papermsg~ `h[`kUse of Charmed Mobs`h]``
`eYou may use charmed mobs to kill other players. But keep in mind that at``
`eall times you are responsible for the actions of your charmies. This``
`emeans that if you avoid some kind of punishment by using a charmie to``
`ekill for you, you will be given the appropriate punishment by an `kImmortal`e.``
`hFurthermore, you are responsible for the actions of your mounts, pets and``
`hany charmed players to whom you have given orders.``
`eAlso, please do not bring or leave aggressive mobs within the city limits``
`eof `kThesden`e. If a player is killed by an aggressive mob which you left``
`ein `kThesden`e, you may be punished for indirect playerkilling.``
`h[`kCheating`h]``
`eCheating is the premeditated use of an imperfection or error in the game,``
`ea 'bug,' in order to gain some kind of undeserved benefit. If something``
`eseems too good to be true, it might be a 'bug,' and you should report it``
`eto an `kImmortal`e. 'Bug' abuse is a serious offense. If you are caught``
`eabusing a 'bug,' your punishment may be as severe as deletion or site-ban``
`efor a worst case scenario.``
`eThe following is a list of rules to help you avoid the use of 'bugs':``
`h*`eNever use a skill which you do not have to initiate a battle.``
`h*`eDo not use arena gear for anything other than fighting inside the arena.``
`h*`eDo not drag players into clan-flagged rooms.``

`h::::::::::::::::::::::: `kThe Rules of Exodus`h :::::::::::::::::::::::::``
`h---------------------------------------------------------------------``
`eWithin the realm of `kExodus`e, there are some rules which you need to``
`eknow and follow. Everyone is welcome to join in the excitement, as long``
`eas you do not break any of the rules. If you are caught breaking a rule,``
`eyou may be punished by an `kImmortal`e. 'Ignorance' is not an acceptable``
`eexcuse for breaking a rule. If you are uncertain whether an action is``
`eagainst the rules, feel free to ask an `kImmortal`e about it.``
`h[`kIllegal Player Attacks`h]``
`ePlayers that are not clanned and not lonered have a special protection.``
`eUnder `iNO `ecircumstance are you allowed to initiate an attack on a``
`enon-clanned, non-lonered player. Also, unless they ask you, it is``
`eagainst the rules to use any skill/spell/prayer/song on them.``
`eAnd if you kill the non-clanned, non-lonered player after having``
`einitiated the combat, your punishment will be greater than if you had``
`eonly attacked and did not kill.``
`cMembers of Greenwood also have this special protection. You may not attack``
`cmembers of this clan. And Greenwood members may not attack other players.``
`eIn order to maintain this special protection, non-clanned, non-lonered``
`eplayers are forbidden to attack clanned and lonered players, and may``
`enot involve themselves in clan affairs. They are encouraged to roleplay,``
`ebut not to help one clan over another.``
`eAll characters, including clanned and lonered, who are level 8 or less``
`eare not allowed to be attacked. And, likewise, all players who are level``
`e8 or less, including members of clans and loners, are not allowed to``
`eattack other players.``
`iYou may not attack or use spells/prayers/songs on linkdead players.``
`h[`kIllegal Player Kills`h]``
`eOnly players that are in a clan or are a loner may attack and kill players``
`eoutside of the arena. `hA loner is marked with a `f[`h*`f] `hflag beside their``
`hname. To see a list of clan symbols type 'clan list.'``
`eIt is illegal to attack and kill a non-clanned, non-lonered player.``
`eAlso, you may not indirectly kill any player that is out of level, more``
`ethan eight levels above or below your level.``
`cIndirect playerkilling is the killing of another player without striking``
`cthe fatal blow yourself, or with one of your charmed mobs or mounts, during a``
`ccombat round. For the purpose of determining culpability in playerkilling``
`ccases, lethal actions have been divided into combat round actions and``
`cnon-combat round actions. Combat round actions are actions which occur``
`cduring a face to face battle, in which blows are exchanged, or, in the``
`ccase of throwing from another room, involve a weapon striking a victim.``
`cNon-combat round actions are actions which do not involve a battle or any``
`cblows being exchanged. These actions do not initiate combat.``
`eIn all cases, it is illegal to indirectly kill a player by means of any``
`enon-combat round action. An example of this is sleeping a player and``
`eletting them starve, or summoning to an ambush and not attacking them yourself.``
`eIndirect playerkilling is legal, however, if it is done by means of a``
`ecombat round action and the victim is in level, within eight levels above``
`eor below your level. An example of this is if you poison a player during``
`ecombat, and they later die as a result of being poisoned.``
`eKeep in mind that if you kill a player that is more than eight levels``
`ebelow your level, you will receive an experience loss.``
`iYou may not directly or indirectly kill linkdead players.``
`h[`kMultiKilling`h]``
`eIn order to give players time to recover from being playerkilled, it is``
`eillegal to kill the same player twice in one 12 real-hour period. However,``
`eonce a player initiates any sort of aggresive action towards another``
`eplayer, they can no longer claim protection from multikilling.``
`h[`kMultiLooting`h]``
`eIn order to give players time to recover from being looted, it is illegal``
`eto loot a player by means of charm twice in a 12 real-hour period. Unlike``
`eprotection from multikilling, protection from being charmed and looted is``
`eonly reversible if the victim states on a public channel that he/she does``
`enot want the protection.``

`eto an `kImmortal`e. 'Bug' abuse is a serious offense. If you are caught``
`eabusing a 'bug,' your punishment may be as severe as deletion or site-ban``
`efor a worst case scenario.``
`eThe following is a list of rules to help you avoid the use of 'bugs':``

`hYears of research and testing by Dr. Gero has produced an``
`heven greater creation than Cell. His new robotic monster is``
`hknown as Transistor. His reflexes are lightning-quick.``
`hHis brain parts have been selected from various intellectuals``
`hwho have recently and mysteriously died. One might mistake him``
`hfor human, as long as they don't see the control panel in the``
`hsmall of his back.``
`hUnfortunately, as with Dr. Gero's other creations, Transistor``
`hlacks a sense of loyalty to Gero, or anyone or anything for that``
`hmatter. Transistor has proclaimed his lordship over the Halls of``
`hthe Heroes. He has been at war with Cell and Gero's other creations``
`hfor many days now. Being robots, having no need for sleep, they``
`hdo battle all day and all night. Transistor has killed several of``
`hGero's creations already. Now he is quickly approaching the lair``
`hof Cell. If Cell is defeated, who knows how far Transistor will``
`hget. Perhaps he will venture into the realm of gods.``
`hCell has offered a huge bounty for the head of Transistor. Seek``
`hout and kill Transistor, and you shall be esteemed by gods and``
`hheroes.``

`h::::::::::::::::::::::: `kThe Rules of Exodus`h :::::::::::::::::::::::::``
`h---------------------------------------------------------------------``
`eWithin the realm of `kExodus`e, there are some rules which you need to``
`eknow and follow. Everyone is welcome to join in the excitement, as long``
`eas you do not break any of the rules. If you are caught breaking a rule,``
`eyou may be punished by an `kImmortal`e. 'Ignorance' is not an acceptable``
`eexcuse for breaking a rule. If you are uncertain whether an action is``
`eagainst the rules, feel free to ask an `kImmortal`e about it.``
`h[`kIllegal Player Attacks`h]``
`ePlayers that are not clanned and not lonered have a special protection.``
`eUnder `iNO `ecircumstance are you allowed to initiate an attack on a``
`enon-clanned, non-lonered player. Also, unless they ask you, it is``
`eagainst the rules to use any skill/spell/prayer/song on them.``
`eAnd if you kill the non-clanned, non-lonered player after having``
`einitiated the combat, your punishment will be greater than if you had``
`eonly attacked and did not kill.``
`cMembers of Greenwood also have this special protection. You may not attack``
`cmembers of this clan. And Greenwood members may not attack other players.``
`eIn order to maintain this special protection, non-clanned, non-lonered``
`eplayers are forbidden to attack clanned and lonered players, and may``
`enot involve themselves in clan affairs. They are encouraged to roleplay,``
`ebut not to help one clan over another.``
`eAll characters, including clanned and lonered, who are level 8 or less``
`eare not allowed to be attacked. And, likewise, all players who are level``
`e8 or less, including members of clans and loners, are not allowed to``
`eattack other players.``
`iYou may not attack or use spells/prayers/songs on linkdead players.``
`h[`kIllegal Player Kills`h]``
`eOnly players that are in a clan or are a loner may attack and kill players``
`eoutside of the arena. `hA loner is marked with a `f[`h*`f] `hflag beside their``
`hname. To see a list of clan symbols type 'clan list.'``
`eIt is illegal to attack and kill a non-clanned, non-lonered player.``
`eAlso, you may not indirectly kill any player that is out of level, more``
`ethan eight levels above or below your level.``
`cIndirect playerkilling is the killing of another player without striking``
`cthe fatal blow yourself, or with one of your charmed mobs or mounts, during a``
`ccombat round. For the purpose of determining culpability in playerkilling``
`ccases, lethal actions have been divided into combat round actions and``
`cnon-combat round actions. Combat round actions are actions which occur``
`cduring a face to face battle, in which blows are exchanged, or, in the``
`ccase of throwing from another room, involve a weapon striking a victim.``
`cNon-combat round actions are actions which do not involve a battle or any``
`cblows being exchanged. These actions do not initiate combat.``
`eIn all cases, it is illegal to indirectly kill a player by means of any``
`enon-combat round action. An example of this is sleeping a player and``
`eletting them starve, or summoning to an ambush and not attacking them yourself.``
`eIndirect playerkilling is legal, however, if it is done by means of a``
`ecombat round action and the victim is in level, within eight levels above``
`eor below your level. An example of this is if you poison a player during``
`ecombat, and they later die as a result of being poisoned.``
`eKeep in mind that if you kill a player that is more than eight levels``
`ebelow your level, you will receive an experience loss.``
`iYou may not directly or indirectly kill linkdead players.``
`h[`kMultiKilling`h]``
`eIn order to give players time to recover from being playerkilled, it is``
`eillegal to kill the same player twice in one 12 real-hour period. However,``
`eonce a player initiates any sort of aggresive action towards another``
`eplayer, they can no longer claim protection from multikilling.``
`h[`kMultiLooting`h]``
`eIn order to give players time to recover from being looted, it is illegal``
`eto loot a player by means of charm twice in a 12 real-hour period. Unlike``
`eprotection from multikilling, protection from being charmed and looted is``
`eonly reversible if the victim states on a public channel that he/she does``
`enot want the protection.``

ExDe papermsg~ Dijo
 The rules and laws of Exodus are essential for establishing and maintaining order in
the realm.  They help keep the fun environment of the realm active while providing
each character with the opportunity to excel in many ways, including that of a noclan
and that of a clanned character.  Rules and laws are always needed to keep a realm
from anarchy, and since Exodus is no different from any other realm these laws and
rules are necessary for order.  The laws were properly chosen by the immortals to
balance all the elements of the realm to provide the highest standards of excellence
for the realm.  The rules and laws also help prevent people from exploiting errors or
bugs in the code for their own personal pleasure in an attempt to balance the realm
like it should be balanced.  When the rules and laws are absent, chaos does erupt, as
was seen when the machine was moved about 2 years ago and for a couple days chars
were allowed to roam free with no rules, as the data would not be saved to the new
machine.  Chaos broke, everyone was angry at each other, hate enveloped all in the
realm.  The only reason people still played after that is because they knew that when
the new machine came, their old lives would be restored.  These lives are not
destroyed because of the rules and laws, making them as essential to Exodus as the
immortals who help regulate them.
Dijo - Part I Question 2
Harrassment is usually not a problem in Exodus, because the rules and laws are
properly upheld, but there are many times that it does occur.  Harrassment can occur
when a mage constantly changes the sex of another character even after being told
to stop.  Harassment can also occur if you wander into someone's personal room and
refuse to leave even after they persistantly ask you to.  Harassment can also occur
if a character repeatedly tells someone after being asked to stop, usually done to
annoy another character.
Dijo - Part I Question 3
Indirect PKing has sometimes been a problem with Exodus, but not since the new
immortals began properly changing and upholding the law.  One example is a mage
sleeping a person then blinding and teleporting another char so the char is stuck and
eventually starves to death because they cannot wake.  Another example is if a char
summons another character to the berserker, who proptly annihilates the summoned char.

      Personally I have had a hard time getting adjusted to life here in this realm.
I began my career fine, but then i joined Jhereg thinking it would help me.  Then I
realized what a bunch of cheaters they were, and that their lives were devoted to
annoying the immortals in any way possible.  I personally did not see the fun in that.
    During my brief initial period with Jhereg I did have many brushes with the law,
both from the guards and immortals, but I learned from my experiences.  I then
decided to try joining divergent, for they were the other sidhe clan and immensily
more respectable than Jhereg.  This went fine until the infamous Harris, who cheated
worse than the Jhereg had, became leader of divergent.  I quickly abandoned ship, for
I had learned well that cheaters never prosper.  I then noticed Jhereg had changed.
The infamous Morian and his minions had left, Paarshad had mellowed out considerable,
and due to cheating from clans and no clans grouping to kill me i desperately needed
some association to help me survive, so i rejoined Jhereg.  Then for over a year and a
half, i just lost track of time.  All of the sudden i woke up some day, with vaguer
memories of the past, although they were still there, and the world around me had
changed greatly.  Fewer inhabitants existed in the realm, and few sidhe ever appeared.
I noticed that all those who had ever had brushes with the law seem to be gone, and
the realm was very peaceful, so I decided to continue my quest.
     Now that i have returned (although it seems like i never left) I realized that
eventually more sidhe may return, and since we sidhe seem to get unfairly treated by
the immortals (simply because we are more uncaring about the laws because we're evil)
I realized that a sidhe lawyer would be needed to help protect those sidhe from the
unfair accusations of others.  I am evil, I admit that, but even evil characters need
help in the law department, they cannot fight all their own battles alone.  That is

survive in a world where few sidhe exist, and those that do are discriminated against.
The sidhe will rise again, and we will conquer the ignorants, but we will do it

Part I, Question 1:
The general purpose of the rules and laws of Exodus is to ensure 
relatively fair, safe, and enjoyable MUD / RP environment for
all, while respecting the rights of others. As all rules and laws,
it is an attempt to allow most players here to interact with certain
expectations on the conduct of others.
The rules are to prevent cheating and harassment, and as such are
enforced by the Immortal staff.  The laws, on the other hand, are
local, IC regulations (such as PK in Thesden), and are enforced by
IC authorities, such as the Thesden guards.
   
Part I, Question 2:
Harassment is behavior with the intent not to kill, but to OOCly
annoy or bother another player.  One example would be to repeatedly
spam the player with tells, thereby making it impossible for him
to see his screen, or in cases of telnet, force him offline. A
second example would be OOC insults to the player, particularly
those based on race, creed, nationality, or sexual preference.
A third type of harassment on Exodus would be following someone
into their personal rooms and remaining where while they wish you
to leave, if the harasser is not there with intent to steal, or
PK (ie, is just there to annoy).
     
Part I, Question 3:
Indirect player killing is when a player (or creature under that
player's control) causes a player character to die without
actually making a killing blow in that round.  While there are
exceptions for cases where a negative status (poison or plague)
was gained during combat, in general Indirect PK is causing someone
to die without actually killing them yourself.  One example of this
would be summoning a loner (or clanned player under level 70, eg)
to a high level aggy area, where you know they will be attacked
and killed by the resident mobs. Another example would be casting
sleep on a player and then letting them starve, or dragging them
into the ocean to drown. In all cases, the offender caused
their target to die without actually killing their target 
themselves, and so indirect PK occurred.
   
   
Part II, Question 1:
True.  Immortals are the final arbitors of what constitutes 
illegal activities on Exodus, not the rule boards.
    
Part II, Question 2:
False.  Players are responsible for the actions of their charmies,
abandoned or no. This extends to aggy mobs that a charmer may
remove from their proper area.
    
Part II, Question 3.
False. The loner symbol is [*]
   
Part II, Question 4:
True. It is illegal to spread plague in Thesden.
    
Part II, Question 5:
False. Players level 8 and lower may not be attacked regardless
of clan status. Not level 10.
     
Part II, Question 6:
True. It is illegal to use foul language on any public channel.
   
Part III, Question 1: c
Part III, Question 2: b
Part III, Question 3: d
Part III, Question 4: c
    
Part IV
I arrived in Thesden at a very young age for an Elf.  With only 
18 summers to my credit, I was barely out of infancy as my people
reckon years.  Why I left Ilewyn, I would rather not say; but rest
assured that it was not by choice.  A great injustice was done
to me that day, but I will not dwell on that now.
The most appealing thing to me about Thesden, is its strong
regard for the rule of law.  Guards patrol the streets regularly,
and the worst offenders are indeed jailed.  This impressed me
greatly: it seems to be a good system, and I would help to support it.
I have led Clan Advocation for perhaps two decades now, and
my motivations for it now are as strong as ever: to help the
unfortunate and downtrodden.  As a Barrister, I would only wish
to do more of the same, either by defending the innocent, or
helping prosecute the guilty to that the innocent might not be
troubled.  I hate like the gates of Hell those who would abuse
the rights of others, or gain advantage through cracks they may
find in the reality of Exodus.  Those who would do such things
break the laws of the gods themselves, and must be punished.
Likewise, those who are unjustly accused need to be exonerated ...
and I feel strongly about doing both.
Above all, I have no wish - none whatsoever - to see the type of
injustice that was done to me, be done to anyone else.  Without
laws and justice, society becomes anarchy where the weak are
preyed upon. I will do everything in my power to see that this does
not happen in Thesden, or any of the lands of Exodus.  Becomming a
Barrister is one step to accomplishing this, but it is an
important one.
