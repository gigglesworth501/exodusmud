Desc Mirinara wears an assortment of `iclothes`` and `aarmor.``  She obviously cares little
for `kfashion.``  She looks `htired,`` but her `jgreen`` eyes seem to notice everything as
she looks around.  Her long `dgolden`` hair is tied back so as to be out of her way.

Bcry  enters and forces you to eat a meal of stale bread and rusty wate~
Plan  `iUntil I am able to share more of my life's story, know this:``
`f I was born into slavery.  My family came from a barren land of`` `ihot`` `fand
```drocky`` `fhills and dunes.  My people could run nearly as fast as horses and
silent both in moving, and in word.  But soon the evil slavers came, and forced
my people to leave their homeland and began working for a crazed mage who was
digging up ruins searching for something.  I was born after my parents had
worked for two years.  I grew up among my people in perhaps their sorriest
state.  My parents taught me our history.  But my mother died when I was 10
and my father when I was 14.  Meanwhile, the mage's underlings brought in more
and more slaves.  Finally, when I was 16, I was freed.  One `kbright sunny day``
`fA rumor spread around that a large group of riders was spotted in the
mountains surrounding the ruins.  Sure enough, later that day a large group
of soldiers led by a young band of adventurers calling themselves the `bblood
riders`` `fattacked.  But it seemed there were too few of them to overcome the
tyrant mage and his cronies and importantly his legions of undead slaves.  But
the `bblood riders`` `fwere more clever than that.  Somehow the and hudreds of
soldiers sprung out from a ruined temple that had been unearthed, and soon
wild and senseless slaughter broke out.  Some of the slaves (including me)
were able to take weapons of the falled and fight along side the soldiers.
Many died that day, but many more lived.  The `bblood riders`` `fset us free but
also gave us a choice.  We could go our own way, or come to help them build a
new nation, supported by their patron `lKarlos`` `falso known as `ethe jackal``
`fwho was rumored to be a great captain of oceanworthy ships.  I decided to join
in the building of this new nation and joined the army of `lKarlos```f.  We sailed
to this new nation (called `gKarlosia```f) and were surprised to see more ruins.
But most of the structures were in excellent shape, as if they had been
deserted thousands of years before.  We were each allowed to choose a small
stone building as a home, and were only required to clean it out.  The `bblood
riders`` `fhad enough money to provide food until we we learned to find food in
the surrounding jungle.  A couple of druids seemed interest in this small
"nation" because they put a lot of effort into teaching us how to grow food
without clearing trees.  Meanwhile, our population continued to grow, mostly
from slaves freed by the `bblood riders`` `fbut also from some travelers and
curious adventurers.  In this way I met Shirakul.  I began to find that I had
potential as a spellcaster, so I began studying with one of the mages working
for the `bblood riders```f.  After about a year I was ready to join in the slave-
freeing missions.  A sizeable group of warriors, clerics, rangers, and mages
got on one of the ships (formerly a slaveship, but now coincidentally called
the Exodus) and set out for a group of islands where slavers were known to
capture natives.  About 2 days into our voyage, our lookout became agitated and
began warning of a large wave approaching.  In the distance, it appeared to be
perhaps a 20 foot wave.  Large, but not dangerous for a warship like ours.  But
as it came closer, we could see that it was more than twice as high as our
ship!  Some jumped overboard, others went into the hold, Shirakul and I quickly
tied ourselves in the riggings.  The wave hit and broke the ship into pieces.
Miraculously, both Shirakul and I survived, and untangled ourselves from the
remains of the ship.  We found some floating barrels of food and tied them
together to make a crude raft.  We used our clothing as sails and hoped we'd
find land so we could make our way back.  Exhausted, we fell asleep on our 
raft.  The next thing I knew I woke up to a peculiar scratching sound.  It was
Shirakul pulling the raft onto a beach!  We had drifted for hours and he had
just been awakened by bad dreams of our shipwreck.  We pulled the raft ashore
and made camp near the coast.  In the morning we figured by the sun that the
coast we were on was on the southeast of whatever island or continent it was
a part of.  So we decided to head northwest.  And that's how we found Thesden.
Thesden is an enjoyable place, but I'd like someday to see `gKarlosia`` `fagain.
So my goal is to learn enough of magic to someday be able to come and go as I
please.``
