Vers 8
Desc Before you stands a 7 1/2 foot tall hulking Vro'ath warrior.  From the
mass of scars covering his body, it's obvious he's seen many battles The
battles have aged him.  What used to be jet black hair is now streaked with
grey.  However, the thick muscles of his arms and legs show no signs of
weakness.  On his forehead you notice a set of scars that are different from
the rest, a series of jagged slashes, the first 3 stained red, the last 2
stained yellow.  Tied around one wrist is a leather thong, caked with long
dried blood.  On his right hip he carries a huge sword, on his left a
menacing whip.  Both look like toys next to his huge frame.  He looks back
at you appraisingly, perhaps sizing up your skill in battle or your value on
the auction block.

Plan  As the huge, old, scarred Vro'ath begins to look you over, you feel your
blood turn cold. You see his left hand resting on his hip, near the handle
of the slaver's whip there, and realize that one too-swift move could mean
the end of your life. So you force yourself to stay calm and sit back and
wait for the aging warrior to start his tale. He seems to sense your
discomfort and he pauses again, relishing the chilling fear that is spreading
through your body. At length he begins..
...
"I was born about 50 years ago, in the Vro'ath city of Nre'yth.
from an early age i was taught to fight and use a sword at the
Academy and i excelled at these things. 10 years later my..
brother, Draven, was born. There was some question about his
birth. Many whispered that he was really the son of a human
slave my father enjoyed and not my mother, but if he was, that
was kept hidden. Draven was a small Vro'ath.. strong but frail
He fought reasonably well, but was clumsy with a sword and tired
easily. He was often a target for his classmates at the Academy
because of his weakness, his questionable birth, and his attitude.
Often I would have to come to his defense, but he only resented
me for it. Meanwhile, I continued to excell at the Academy and
when I'd learned all that the Academy could teach me, I left
Nre'yth in search of new challenges, wealth, and slaves. I settled
in Thesden. There, I found Varruk, a group of Vro'aths and evil
dwarves, dedicated to Ne'shajh and the enslavement of the weaker
races. Some time later, Draven came to Thesden. He had changed.
He had given up the life of a warrior, and instead turned to
magic. Not the magic grant to the clergy by Ne'shajh through prayer,
but a different sort of magic, gained from old books, strange words
of power, and powerful demons. It was also clear that he despised me.
He would say nothing to me except that I had made him weak and he
had made himself strong. Strangely he joined Varruk and serves the clan
well, although to this day he will have nothing to do with me. 
 I met a fierce Vro'ath warrioress named J'zara, who I later wed.
Many have come to know the fear that is a Vro'ath and his mate
charging into battle. As the strongest warrior, eventually I came
to lead Varruk. I led Varruk into many battles for the glory of
Ne'shajh, great victories and stunning defeats. At one point I
thought to retire, but I know now I have many more battles left
ahead of me. One day I will retire and become that old Vro'ath
sitting and telling war stories to the litlens ringed around me.
But Varruk will live on, and one day the Vro'ath will achieve their
destiny as Ne'shajh has commanded and Varruk and the Vro'ath race
reign supreme.
