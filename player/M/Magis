Desc Glaring into his deep black cold eyes, you can almost see your own
reflection bouncing back to you.  He has long blue hair,
and soft pale skin that has burn marks from his encounters with
Lavos and his minions.  His hand holds a staff of Time
and in his other hand he holds a crystal ball, silky silver
and shining in the light.  He sends a stern half bent smile towards
you, greeting you with a ceremonius tip of his long pointed
hat. As you look again trying to decipher just how old or young he is
He says a few mumbled words and disappears into thin air.

Plan  Born in the times of the Ice Age, Magis was brought up as son of the Queen of
Enhansa, the City of Sleep.  During this period there arose an evil force,
 by the name of Lavos, which means big fire.  He was pure evil and did nothing
but steal the souls from those who slept.  He took over the body of the Queen
and tricked her into making a shrine for him.  Magis who at this time saw what
 it did to his mother and his sister was filled with rage and fury, he vowed to
revenge what had happened to his mother and sister by destroying the evil being
Lavos.  Magis ran from enhanse and took up his studying in a little town called
Durasi, a place of pure meditation and complete silence and magic studying.
During this time of complete solitude Magis showed signs of improving and later
destined to find a way to vanquish Lavos, and restore peace to the wonderful
way it was.
Then Lavos got tired of waiting for the entire kingdom to fall into his grasp.
He took up all who were followers and decided it was time to crush Magis and his
puny force.  Magis knowing he was overcomed by Lavos and his army, took refuge
in a small cave on the mainland not floating in the sky.  The people on this
could not use magic, so they worked for the Queen in the underwater palace,
was the shrine for Lavos.  In this big shrine in the center was a spectacular
sight called the Mammon Machine.  This was what Lavos used to transfer people's
souls into energy.  The more people slept and dreamt the more energy Lavos made.
It got to be so bad that people never woke up and therefor Lavos always grew in
power.
Magis tired of this crap pulled together all his studying and opened a gate
leading to a place he could never fortell.
As Magis took one last look upon his destroyed kingdom and past a glance
at the once beautiful floating palace of Enhansa, he stepped through hoping
to one day find a way to call upon Lavos and destroy him for good.
