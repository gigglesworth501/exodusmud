Desc A ruggish looking treehugger with no sign of intellectual power.
He looks over you with his sap covered face.
Do you see something that he is missing? Maybe he didn't comb his hair?
Well anyways he has blue eyes, blondish-dirt covered hair, and can't sing
worth crap.  If you look closely you can see that he doesn't shave much either.
He has a grown beard with nothing to show for a mustache but peach fuzz.
He talks with a very errr gayish i mean soft petalled voice.
He asks you how the weather is and all that.  He is almost friendly looking
when you stare long enuff (which might be bad for you).
Talk to me if you see fit, for i do nothing but watch over others level.

Bcry  screams, FOR MY MOTHER'S DANDELION PETALS!~
Plan  Abandoned by his parents when he was a baby, MrRose ended up in a patch full of roses.
He is raised by a giant dandelion, in hopes that he might learn the ways of the 
treehugger.  He walked around the garden for a bout 15 years, wondering why his
mother dandelion had died so fast.  Without a sense in the world he ventured out
into the vast beyond.  Stumbling upon a rock with strange writing on it.
He decided to pick it up.  Underneath was a beautiful picutre of a female bard.
This bard was very beautiful.  She had a figure to die for!  MrRose filled with
...err umm Dignity thats it...decided to meet this wonderful lady.
Running into the forest he found the pool of transendence of which allowed him
to wonder deep into other realms.
He plugged his nose and jumped into the pool, in hopes of showing this lovely
bard just what he had errr could give her...anyways.  As the story goes
he finds himself madly in love with this woman and decides to propose to her.
Later did he find out that this was no woman at all!  But a transvestite, lost
in the world of reality.  He thought to himself that love might not be his best
part of him.  So he later ran into the forest and lived with the molting petals
 of his mother dandelion.
