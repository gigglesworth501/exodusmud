Vers 8
Desc A large vro'ath towers before you.  He is clad in black robes, adorned with
ceremonial runes, and about his neck dangles an onyx pendant inscribed with the
symbol of the mighty god Ne'Shajh.  He walks with dignity, his head held high, and
seemingly oblivious to your presence.  Yet he moves with a purpose, as though he's
following something.  Suddenly a chill runs down your spine, and for an instant
you see a ghostly image of the largest vro'ath warrior you have ever seen, standing
in front of the robed figure.  The ghostly warrior slowly turns its head and points
a long clawed finger at you, and then vanishes.  The robed vro'ath stops for a second
and you swear you hear the sound of a quiet sinister laughter.

Plan  In the deep north where the vro'ath tribes still control the land, a young vro'ath
by the name of Nrek was born to the tribe Da'tuk.  As a child, Nrek grew up hearing
the stories of the glorious battles in the south, and of great vro'ath generals
battling against the infidels and enslaving the weak races.  Stories of a city
named Thesden reached Nrek's ears, and how the mighty vro'ath hosts had been
unsuccessful in their conquests there, and how their numbers had been dwindling
there for some time, and soon the battle would be lost.  In the following years
Nrek trained as a warrior, as was the tradition in his tribe, determined to go
south and gain glory, but by the time Nrek was of age, it was said that the battle
was nearly lost, and that hopes of conquest there might be doomed.  Rage welled
up in Nrek, and he vowed to succeed where the other had failed.  At first he
traveled from tribe to tribe, trying to gather an army, but without a reputation
he was only able to gather a small handful of young, unseasoned warriors.
Unsuccesful in his attempts to raise the army, Nrek took the few warriors he had
been able to gather and headed south towards thesden.  On the journey south, his
band was ambushed by a Dwarven patrol, and after a long battle, only Nrek had
survived.  Badly wounded, and in an unfamiliar land, Nrek wandered in the Mountains
for days.  As Nrek traveled, a freak storm appeared, and it soon turned into a
blizzard.  Nrek trudged onward, but he was greatly weakened by his wounds, and
collapsed, doomed to die in in the mountains.  Before lapsing into unconsiousness
Nrek said a prayer to Ne'Shajh, asking him to help carry on the fight.
     Nrek awoke to find himself in small cave, beside a small campfire.  Then a
voice spoke to him:  '`k`b"Arise young warrior, it is not your time.  You have been
chosen to bring victory to the vro'ath nation, and death to the infidels.  Now, come
and follow me to glory."``
    `hNrek stood up, and before him, he saw the ghostly image of Ne'Shajh, clad in
blackened armor, and wielding a mighty axe.  Ne'Shajh placed his hand on Nrek's
shoulder, and into him poured a new strength, the strength and fury of Ne'Shajh.
`b"Now, you will follow me to Thesden for I have many things to teach you."``
