Plan  This is the story of one of the richest, most spoiled little children
ever to have been born.  It is said that right after his birth, 
his parents caught him stealing pea pods from his siblings and then selling
back the empty pods for a silver each.
His parents were at a loss as to what to do, so they sent him to visit the
Abbey in the east in hopes that it would bring more charity to his spirit.
Instead, he became worse and worse, till the point when he was caught selling
the farmers who visited the Abbey 50 silver for a gold piece, convincing them 
that the greater quantity was indeed more than they had started with!
He was expelled from the Abbey and sent back home to less than recieving
parents who decided that they would just sell him to a travelling show and
be done with him.  But to their suprise, he managed to convince the troupe
master that his parents were worth more in the long run and managed to have 
them sold into slavery along with the rest of his family. He was quite pleased
with his handiwork, and decided to go traveling to someone more spoiled and
devious than he.  To this day he still wanders the lands in search the the
ultimate spoiled brat.
