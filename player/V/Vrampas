Desc A short, gaunt dwarf stands before you. Hair of `aonyx`` strangles down from his heavily scarred face. His beard and mustache although not unkept are very long and braided dangling down his chest.

Bcry  `iFOR THE LITTLE PEOPLE!!!!``~
Plan  Born in the Dwarven City of Dobluth Kyor, I was raised by my uncle, 
a human cleric called Iltud. One day on the outskirts or the Kyor, 
I was taken by a Vroath raiding party to be sol into slavery
After hearing my master tell me many times that he would sell me tomarrow. 
He soon taught me to fight in the manner of the Vroath, Bloodthirsty 
and unforgiving. It seems he taught me to well as I challanged him to 
combat and slayed him on my 16th birthday.
I was free. I ran in the direction of the Kyor and was befriend on the way by one called Sir Kryn of the Clan Brotherhood and to this day have fought with my 
brothers in the defense of the free and for the name of justice.
