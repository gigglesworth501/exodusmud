Plan  `hI have loved ships for as long as I can remember.  My father, `cVedric`h, was a
master shipbuilder, as was his father before him.  Not surprisingly, I was one
too.  Oh, don't feel sorry for me.  I'm retired now.  More on that later.
`h
I grew up in `dThesden`h, specifically near the docks.  My father built and sold
ships from a shop just off of Dock Street.  It remains there today, although
the name on the sign has changed.  My father would craft beautiful ships of
all sizes that sprang from his creativity and months of meticulous design.
Only when he felt he could not improve upon it any more, would he buy lumber
taken from the nearby `cForest Fierense`h, fresh from the lumbermill near the
stream.  I apprenticed under my father, later becoming a journeyman shipwright
and eventually, a master, with the retiring of my father.
`h
During the time I ran the shop, many things changed in `dThesden`h, mostly for the
better.  The city's continued expansion, brought greater demand for ships, as
trade to `eEbon Downs`h and `gFreeport`h increased, and explorers began requesting
smaller faster and less-expensive ships to chart the `nwaters`h far from `nColwyn
Bay`h.  Times were good and business increased to the point where I took on an
apprentice of my own, a young man named `iAsrac`h.  `iAsrac`h has a great technical
mind and is very skilled with his hands, although his confidence was badly
shaken after a shipbuilder was killed by a fallen mast.  It was no fault of
`iAsrac's`h design, but he blamed himself nonetheless.  Still, as time goes by,
his many successes will push this tragedy into the past.
`h
Recently, I noticed the docks have been taking on a new kind of trade--one
which I am not too fond of.  Pirates (though they call themselves Privateers)
are becoming a permanent fixture in the city's wharf district.  Some years
ago, the `vS.S. Ragnar`h came to port and has been moored as a sort of permanent
base of operations for a clan of pirates led by a `lCanthi`h who calls himself
`iP`jo`ks`ls`mu`nm`h.  `iP`jo`ks`ls`mu`nm`h doesn't seem the evil sort, and he has brought me plenty of
business, but he consorts with a crowd I would rather not be around.  The
change in the environment of the docks as well as `iAsrac's`h obvious readiness
to become a master shipwright himself, along with my own age, have led me to
decide that retirement is the way to go.  Besides, I have longed to travel to
so many of these places I hear about on the docks.
`h
Far to the southwest, there supposedly exists a `kCity of the Sun`h.  Maybe some
day I will find out if this story is true...

ExDe papermsg~ `lWelcome to the realms of `nExodus`h.  Upon entering our world,
you will notice that there is no traditional mud school or newbie zone.
It is our intention to immerse players immediately, the world around you being
your entire 'newbie area'.  Thus, reading this `bNeophyte Manifesto`h becomes
monumentally important to your prosperity and survival here.  Note that   
everything covered in this document is pursued at greater length in the  
help files. Please also type story to read something of Exodus history.

The manifesto is divided into several categories.  
To read the different parts, just type look `kkeyword`h.

`o[`kYou`o] [`hThe `kworld `haround you`o] [`hOther `kplayers`o] [`hYour `kplace`h in the world`o]`h               
~
ExDe you~ `o[`iYou`o]`h                                                                 
You are the center of your universe.  There are many ways in which you        
can make your character unique, aside from the customization you have         
already undertaken in choosing your skills and attributes.  You can           
change your title [help title], give yourself a description [help description],
formulate a battlecry [help battlecry]  -- and you can do it all in color    
[help color].                                                   
               
When your character is born, he/she/it receives a set of low level
equipment. To see what you are wearing, type equipment.  To see what you are 
holding, type inventory.  Exodus supports full abbreviation, so if you don't 
want to type out these full commands, you can use 'eq' and 'i', respectively. 
If you should ever lose your newbie gear, you can type outfit to re-eq.      

Your character's attributes and nuances are important to your evolution as     
you rise in power and knowledge.  To see your character's score sheet,        
type score.  To see quickly how wealthy your character is, or how much        
experience you require to level, type worth.  The experience you receive      
from killing non-player-characters (NPCs), exploring the world, or            
participating in both built-in area and immortal run quests determines        
your level. [help experience, help level]                                     
~
ExDe world~ `o[`iThe world around you`o]`h     
There are many things in the world that you will become aware of as you       
wander about.  The world of Exodus is vast, comprised of many mystical        
lands.  [help areas]    
A few commands are necessary to master if you want to experience the    
full impact of Exodus: look, where, and who. [help look] [help where] &       
[help who] have extensive information concerning these important commands.    
    
`o[`hobjects`o]`h                                                              
Mundane and arcane items alike can be found, bought, or battled for in    
the realms of Exodus.  Although you may discover a proliferation of
telluric items within its sprawls, the luckiest adventurers may sometimes     
come across fabled treasures, rare beyond description.                        
                                                                              
`o[`hmobiles`o]`h                                                              
Unlike many other foriegn environments, the extensive lands of Exodus are   
inhabited by both intelligent players, and...intelligent monsters.          
Instinctual animals may not offer much of a challenge, but cognizant           
creatures with actual aspects of sentience (for example, city guards,       
farmers, or soldiers) may just surprise you -- look at them, talk to them,  
do what you deem to be wise around them to see how they react.  And should  
you choose to engage in combat with them and find yourself over your head,  
you may just find that enraged farmer or cityguard hunting you down to      
finish the job.                                                                
~
ExDe player players~ `o[`iother players`o]`h                                                        
Although most of the inhabitants of Exodus may appear to be friendly,          
it is always advisable to take everything with a grain of salt and             
view the world through a cynic's eyes -- even the most harmless-looking      
player can evolve into a vicious enemy in the span of a few seconds.           
Exploring the large universe that Exodus provides is a very good way          
to avoid messy conflicts with other violent players, and is strongly          
encouraged, especially to new players.                                        
                                                                             
This advice does not directly apply to players level 1 - 8 (as these        
lower-level players are protected by immortal intervention), but it           
is advisable that you begin exploring the planet early on, to get a            
grasp of the terrain and places to adventure.                                
   
Player-killing outside of the 10-level range established by the               
creators of the lands of Exodus will result in the garnering of a              
wanted flag, and possibly a trial [help justice, help laws].                   
~
ExDe place~ [Your place in the world]
After establishing your persona within the Realms of Exodus, you will
most likely be tempted to exercise your freedom and broaden your 
horizens by taking advantage of the many built-in features of the world:
  
[Clans]
Clans are groups of like-minded players that have both the willpower and
the manpower to organize themselves in objectives that may include
conquering areas, warring with other clans, and/or promoting 
a specific goal or cause. See [help clan and clan war].
  
[Homes]
You can establish private sectors for yourself, your clan, or your loved
one(s) in certain areas in the world of Exodus, for a price. This is best
done after you have become an experienced adventurer and amassed
some money. Refer to [help homes] for more information.
  
[Transportation]
The forms of transport in the Realm of Exodus are many and varied.
Elevator mechanisms coupled with moving battle machines, boats,
mounts, and magical means of transport are ways to move yourself 
around all kinds of terrain. For traditionalists, you can also walk to 
most places. Please read the following files:
[help boat, help mount, help transportation].
  
[Good places to go]
A good place for newbies to start is the Thesden Animal Exhibition 
Gardens, informally called the zoo. It is located on Welford Road,
on the far east side of Thesden. Once the pleasures of the Zoo have 
begun to pall, you can explore, hunt wabbits!, or satisfy your 
bloodthirst at Ashton Gardens (near the center of Thesden), or 
in the Eastern Plains or Sarrendale Farms (outside of the East
Gate of Thesden).
