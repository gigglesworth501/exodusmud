`5                                                                   
`5                                                                   
`5  The Judgement                                                    
`5     The Receptive brings about sublime success,                   
`5     Furthering through the perseverance of a mare.                
`5     If the superior man undertakes something and tries to lead,   
`5     He goes astray;                                               
`5     But if he follows, he finds guidance                          
`5     It is favorable to find friends in the west and south,        
`5     To forego friends in the east and north                       
`5     Quiet perseverance brings good fortune.                       
`5                                                                   
`5  The Image                                                        
`5     The earth's condition is receptive devotion                   
`5     Thus the superior man who has breadth of character            
`5     Carries the outer world.                                      
`5                                                                   
`5
