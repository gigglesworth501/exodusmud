ExDe book~ A magical force keeps you from opening this tattered book,
and the arcane words etched upon its leather cover  are of 
a language you have never seen before, a language you cannot read.
You can still feel the magic emanating from inside its covers,
probably possessing hidden secrets that only Old Man Torun can
decrypt.
