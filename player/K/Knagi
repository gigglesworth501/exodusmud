Vers 8
Desc A grizzled old elf's green eyes look wistfully off into the distance. His
long brown hair hangs down to his back, contrasting with the shimmering red
cloak that adorns his back. He carries an ordinary looking blackthorn staff
with a chunk of amber on the end. As you look him up and down, you can tell
he does not ascribe to any mode of fashion.
 
He wears a grey, loose fitting shirt with a picture of the famous bard
Catriana painted upon it, but he wears no pants. His boots have wicked blades
upon them, however, which look a little out of place considering how skinny
his legs are. On his right hand (the hand that holds the staff), he wears 
two white-gold rings that glow with a soft white light, and on his left, he
wears a sock-puppet with a canthi face. On his wrists, he wears a pair of
bracers that seem to draw your gaze towards them and hold it. His arms bear
His arms bear an eagle's insignia, next to which a skull made of the finest
crystal floats.
 
As you turn your gaze away from him, the skull turns towards you and winks.

Plan  His past can be read in any well-stocked library, his exploits, his faults, his
successes and his failures. Those things have been discussed and detailed in
other places, and it does us no good to dwell upon them here. As the wars of
old change from history to a far off myth, one would think that one who lives
in the heat of chaos (such as Knagi), would find himself out of place. Instead,
he has taken a new lease on life. From his mansion in WeinCloudstan, Knagi 
manages his holdings across the realms. From Castle Dunluce, where King
Athanmere remembers his faithful (if erratic) service, to the Palace of
WeinCloudStan, where the Empress has given him title and estates, to the City
of the Sun, where he owns a market, Knagi has spread his influence across the
realms.
 
Though he often leaves the realms, he always returns, madder than ever.
Lately, he has begun to spread tales of a fiery apocalypse, a sundering of
everything that Exodus has ever held dear. In his vision, nothing will emerge
unscathed, not even the chaos that has always haunted the realm. As with any
apocolypse, even this one tells of a rebirth, and a great renewal. Thesden's
ashes will be covered by an even greater city, whose spires will be seen
around the world.
