Desc You see a relatively average looking elf, blue eyes, blond hair and fair
skin; all seems normal exept for his behavior.  He has an edgy look about
him.  His eyes are always glancing about, and he is talking constantly,
though not to anyone in particular, mainly just himself.  Ask him a question
and your likely to get an earful about his opinions on gods, which mainly
focus' on him, since he is one.  Without a doubt, you have just found
yourself in the presense of a madman.

Plan  A story copied down by a bard who happened to be in the room:
`6``
Many many years ago, not to long after the dawn of time, but not so recently that
it would have taken place after the great cataclysm, mainly because the story
itself is about something that directly relates to the cause of the cataclysm, so
having it take place afterwords wouldn't make much sense because if it did, then
it couldn't be true at all, even though it is.  So shortly prior to the great
cataclysm, a mighty god ruled over the heavens.  He was all powerful, as most
gods are, but he was far far more all powerful than any other god who was a god,
and this all powerful god was the feared and hated by the other gods because they 
were jealous of his power.  They were all evil and twisted, and their anger was
so great that they all went insane and crazy and lost their minds.  Their
insanity made them jealous, so jealous they wanted to take the mighty gods power
and take make it their own.  But they confronted the mighty god, and they
couldn't beat him because he was too powerful, so they had to leave.  But they
didn't stop, they kept plotting against the god, and then they started fighting
over who was to get the power when they got it, so they started killing each
other.  When the gods started dieing bad bad things happened, and people died.
Lots and lots of people died, and got sick, and got plauges, so the mighty god
decided he had to stop them, so he gave them each a bit of his sanity.  Then the
other gods got right in the head, but they didn't get right in the heart, so they
were still evil, but now the mighty god was insane.  So the evil sane gods
overthrem him and shattered his essance.  The mighty gods essance fell to earth
and his spirit now roams the mortal realm in pieces.  And thats why I'm here.
You mean thats why "We're" here.  Yes because we are the divine essance of the
mightiest of the gods, and I must find my brothers and join with them so we can
once again rise to the heavens.  Yes we must rise to the heavens again.  Thats
what I said. Well, we have joined three... er... two of us now, and soon I shall
be whole again.  It will take time but at least I have my sanity again.
`6``
So goes the story of Glorfindel.  All of it is true, just ask him.

Those who are very new to the city should attempt to venture towards
the east gate (east of the fountain down Cumberland), and south of
Farmer's Square, until they reach Welford Road.  Travelling south down
Welford, watch for signs indicating an Animal Exhibition (check your
map if you get lost), and venture inside  -  the zoo is a nice place
for adventurers to have fun and explore in before attempting to take
their quests out of the city.
 
`o[`cThe Eastern Prairie`o]``                 
After finding your bearings in the city of Thesden, travel east down
Cumberland until you find yourself in Farmer's Square.  From there,
go one south and east, and you will find yourself in the Eastern
Prairie, an excellent place for newcomers to explore and adventure
in.
