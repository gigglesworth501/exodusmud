Vers 8
Desc `aBefore you stands all that you fear in the world.  Hatred, pain, and
fear are `aall embodied in this twisted beast.  The face, elongated like a
dragons, still resembles a dwarves features, but the teeth are designed for
tearing, and `a no dwarf you've ever seen had smoking `ired `aeyes.  If you
dare reach out `aand touch this beast, its skin, black and shiny like
obsidian, is ice cold to `athe touch.  Towering over you, leathery black
tattered wings spread, casting `athier shadow over you.  And as your heart
leaps in your throat, you close your `aeyes.  A low growl, deep enough to
cause your bones to shake, rumbles through the `a air, and you open your
eyes, to see nothing.  You look to the sky, praying to your weak `agods,
hoping to live through the day, and quickly leave, walking as fast as `a
your legs will carry you.  But the day is still young, and the beast is
still near...

Bcry  has so many ways to show you how your Dogma has abandoned you.~
Plan  For years after my first encounter with the elders, and with Erion, I was confused.
  And for months after my second encounter, I was angry.  Frustrated and fed up with
the gods being bold enough to think that they could control me, and that I was a 
simple toy with which to wage their wars.
  Finally, that tiny seed of darkness grew into a shining black diamond of hate.
I could feel it spread through me like a cancer, and at first I was afraid.
  I was scared and afraid, because I was once again dealing with a part of me that I
rarely let shine through, a dark half of my soul that I kept locked up like a 
prisoner inside myself.  I was concerned that the gods themselves would come down 
from their thrones on the highest peaks, and smite me.
But still the darkness grew.  The tiny jem of my hate became like the most brilliant
of diamonds, and the black light that pulsed from within shone itself on every aspect
of my being.  I discovered the most powerful of all emotions, and I reveled in my
hate.  Slowly, I became aware of the sheer pleasure I took out of killing my enemies,
and my contempt of all things living grew like a cancer inside me, until I was no longer
recognizable by those close to me.  I'm not sure when I began to change physically,
at first it was so gradual as to be almost unnoticeable, but as the days and weeks 
progressed, the transformation picked up pace, as if the gifts the gods have given me
were turning on me.  Wracked with physical agony, I screamed to the heavens, and cursed
the god who had created me.  And he cursed me back.  His voice, clearer than any bell
and sharper than any blade, spoke down from the heavens to me.  "You have lost your way,
young dwarf.  You have let yourself become corrupted by those you were sent to destroy
and have let the seed within you grow.  Your body, filled with the holiest of light,
has become a temple of blackness.  You will exist, no more".  And with those words,
all that I was became nothingness.  I fell to my knees, weak and unable to hold myself
up from the great weight that my armor put on my shoulders.  I fell to my side, 
hitting my head upon the fountain at the center of town.  as my life blood flowed and 
tinted the water like red smoke, I lost conciousness.
  The voice called faintly to me at first, like a wave from a long distance.
slowly, it grew louder, calling my name with a silken tounge.  I never saw the speaker,
nor do I believe I ever wanted to.  But I know the name.  Ne'Shajh.  I know the name 
very well.  The great dark beast called to me, and told me of a greater plan than the
ones the elders had held, one of a much greater and darker scale.  The dark beast told me
of my true destiny, and of the reasons why the elders had tried so desperately to control
me, and finally, Ne'Shajh gave me the gift, and how my gift was much greater than anything
the ignorant gods of men and elves could ever give me.  I was evil incarnate, the thing
that children were told stories of at bed time, in order to frighten them into submission.
I was the thing that lurked in mens hearts, and made them run from the dark places.
I was Fear.
  
I awoke, writhing in agony.  Screaming aloud, great black wings burst from my back,
and the pale whiteness of my skin turned a shiny obsidian black.  Razor sharp spikes
erupted from my shouders and elbows, and my muscles cracked like whips as they reshaped
themselves in my true creators image.  and I stood.
No longer truly dwarf, I had become an avatar of evil, I had become death.
And I liked it.
