Desc `aYou see a dwarf hunched over, holding his black coat closed with one
hand as if he were warding off a chill.  His pallid yellow skin
appears to have been draped over his bones, giving the impression that
there is no flesh beneath.  His head is down, but his feverish eyes
peer up from under a knitted brow as his breath rasps in his chest.  A
small polished `osilver`a cross hangs on a chain around his neck,
looking totally out of place.``

Plan  `a  He was born away in a cornfield in the middle of the night, the
bastard son of Lust and Greed.  Lust looked upon her newly-born child
and gasped at the ugly deformation that squirmed in her arms.  Disgust
and Terror touched her then and caused her to drop her bawling child
and run away screaming through the night until Insanity found her and
calmed her.
  Evil sensed what had been brought into the world and immediately
went to the child as he lay abandoned in the tall cornfield.  The
child looked upon Evil's dark face and Love caused him to reach out
for Evil with his deformed arms.
  "Ahh", said Evil as he picked the child up and held him, "You are
truly my Son."
  
`o  He was reborn in Thesden just before dawn, with the lifeless
bodies of innocents strewn around him and blood dripping from his
fingers.  About to slaughter another, he raised his sword and looked
into his prey's eyes, expecting to see Fear.  But what he saw was not
Fear but Sadness and Pity, and for a moment he faltered.  God then
took him in hand and placed within him the burning white fire of
Truth.  Truth opened his eyes and he saw himself with the eyes of his
his prey.  Overcome with the vision he was sent, he dropped to his
knees, raised his hands to the Heavens and cried out, "NO MORE!"``
