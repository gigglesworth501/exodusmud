Desc Wow.  You knew dwarves tend to be ugly, but you think his mother wouldn't even
be seen with Balakir.  He looks like he'll leave you alone, or even group with
you (if you can stand looking at him) but he glares at the nobles he sees, 
maybe he envies their wealth?  No, knowing Balakir, it probably has to do with
a business deal.  Yeah, those damn nobles probably tried to cheat
Balakir.

Bcry  prepares for even more senseless slaughter.~
Plan  Balakir came from a long line of miners.  Tradition among the Hearthglow clan
was for the second sons to become either metalsmiths or gemcutters, and thirdor subsequent sons to become merchants who would sell the finished wares.  Some
of those merchants would be jewelers, others might be armorers or weaponsmiths
who would craft the valuable metals and gems into their wares.  Balakir was one
such weaponsmith.  He enjoyed his work, and eventually was chosen to sell his
wares in the mostly human settlement of Thesden.  However, the council of nobles
decided that he would have to pay high taxes because they said the money was
being sent back to the dwarves.  This was not wholly true; clan Hearthglow was
only receiving about one part in twenty of Balakir's income.  He protested
against this obviously unfair taxation, and soon "Balakir's Blades" was the
target of many burglaries.  One night Balakir hid in his shop and waited, and
sure enough, he heard a scratching sound at his lock.  About five minutes later,
as the thief was quietly laying swords and axes into a sack, Balakir jumped
at the dark clad figure with his finest sword.  The battle was fierce, but
Balakir had the element of surprise, and slew the thief with only a few
minor wounds to show for it.  The city watch came within minutes, just as
Balakir had finished bandaging himself.  The promptly dragged him off to jail.
Eventually he was released, but when he returned, he found his shop completely
looted.  He sold his shop (what little was left) fter making one more sword, and set out for revenge.
