Vers 7
Desc `gA laughing, singing ocean chick.  She has long blue hair and a``
`gwicked smile that can often scare even her friends.  She has been``
`gspotted near the Thesden area, trying to persuade the locals into``
`ggiving her some cash or gear in exchange for some horrid``
`gperformances.  Hopefully her abilities will improve or that she``
`gwill manage to get people to pay her just to go away.  Only time``
`gwill tell.``

Plan  `gLike a screaming siren out on the rocks, Bluenote has come to Thesdan
to`` `grob men of their hearts and money.  She sings loudly and badly, but
she will`` `gdefinately grab your attention if nothing else.  When she isn't
running around`` `gthinking up new schemes, she can be found in Thesden
square mumbling about`` `ghow lonely and scared she is.  Don't be fooled
though, she will use you and`` `gleave you at the drop of a hat, and knowing
her nature is the only thing that`` `gshe is really frightened of.  ``

ExDe gloves~ These gloves have been made from the finest and smoothest satin material,
a beautiful feeling on the hands.  They do not look like they were made for
very difficult labor, they are showpieces to be sure.
