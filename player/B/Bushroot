Vers 7
Desc You see a massive dwarf standing in front of you.  Standing 5'6" and weighing close to 300lbs with
bulging muscles and the scars of many battles.  His armor, although it is very abused, is some  
of the finest youve seen collected from the far corners of Exodus, taken from enemies, or as 
gifts from friends.  He greets his friends with a tip of his hat saying "How goes it today?"
He greets his enemies with drawn weapons and a wicked grin.  Even if you are not a friend or foe
do not be afraid to approach this man because he has the knowledge of many years behind him.
Overall you feel as if you have met the man and you have a overwhelming desire to be like him.
`i Long Live the Brotherhood.  Woe to those who cross our Path, for our wrath will strike you down.``

Plan  Bushroot was born in a small dwarven mining village in the far northern
reaches of Exodus.  Born to Zuel Rockbreaker and his wife Rensa when they
were very young.  He was the pride and joy of his father.  When he was very
young a shortage of food struck the village a terrible blow.  Many people
moved away from the village when this happened but his father was too proud
to leave his homeland.  His family resorted to feeding on roots and berries.
Bushroot loved stewed roots and berries and that is how he received his
name.  Well eventually the hard times passed and when he was old enough he
went to work in the mines with his father.  Although he loved his work, he
longed for the danger and combat that some of the older dwarves talked
about.  So in his spare time he spent time learning how to be a warrior.  He
also grew to an immense size for a dwarf and towered over the others in his
clan.  Some did not like him, because of his abilities and his size.  One
day some travelers from Thesden happened to pass through his village.  He
was in awe.  One of the warriors was Stratis who convinced him to return to
Thesden with him.  He said his goodbyes with a tearful eye to his parents
and relatives.  He arrived in Thesden and soon paired with a dwarf named
Sark who had similar aspirations of joining the Clan Brotherhood.  He
advanced quickly in level and rank in this new society.  Soon he joined the
Brotherhood and attained the highest mortal level possible.  But yet he was
still not satisfied.  After a long battle with enemies he realised that he
was not strong enough yet.  So he prayed to his gods and asked to be reborn
into a new body.  His wish was granted and was reborn.  Full of his wisdom
from his former life he soon was on his way once again.  But it felt as if
something was missing from his life.  Gorstag, whom he had known in his
former life, helped to fill the void that was there by extending the
membership and rank that he had when he was in Clan Brotherhood.  When he
rejoined he was also bestowed Deputyship to recruit and have a more active
role in the clan.  Bushroot has other plans when he gets older but for now
is perfectly happy defending Thesden from the scum and ilk that tries to
infect this great city
