Vers 8
Desc `a'     `eA mighty warrior clad in `adark-steel armor `etowers before you, an aging Vro'ath bearing the `bscars `eof countless battles.  Among these scars you can make out 4 prominent ones on his forehead `a<`b///`k//`a> `esymbolizing a position of 
`egreat leadership among the Varruk Clan.
`ePouches and bags overflowing with strange trinkets and other varrious items tied all about him, and strange looking `gweapons `eand pieces of `harmor `edangle from his belt and shoulders.
`eOddly enough, he seems to be in a good mood (for a Vro'ath that is), and sppears to be unperturbed as you look at him.   But even with his somewhat mild temper, you can see the `klight of battle `ein his eyes.
`eYou can also see the `b"Trophies" `eof previous challengers hanging next to the pouches on his belt.

Plan  He arrived on Thesden on a story night, long ago, when the realm of
exodus was new and the Vro'ath were still few.  He came without purpose,
without religion, and without without any companions.  Then he met Stratis,
a young dwarf warrior, who like himself, was seeking a purpose.  The two set
off on adventures seeking fame and glory.  With Stratis, LightsBane
developed a strong sense of honor and justice.  So when Stratis founded the
Vanguards, LightsBane jumped at the chance to join.  To his dismay, even
with all of his deeds, LightsBane was shunned by the population of Thesden. 
Later, when the Vanguards disbanded he lost his faith in good and turned t
To his dismay, even with all of his deeds, LightsBane was shunned by the he
kept when the Vanguards disbanded.  Having lost his faith in kindness, he
turned to wandering, and eventualy found sanctuary with Takhisis, the
goddess of evil.  Along with Takhisis he found the Dark Warriors, the
Knights of Takhisis.  A gropu of Warriors with the same sense of honor as
Lightsbane, but here, he didnt suffer the predjudice of the other members of
the clan as he did in the Vanguards.  Here, he remained content.  That is
until the Brotherhood arrived in Thesden.  When the Brotherhood arrived,
they brought with them a new god.  A god of kindess and law.  When they
arrived, the Knights of Tekhisis abandoned there god and took refuge under
the god of the Brotherhood.  Feeling betrayed by his fellows, LightsBane
turned again to wandering, and met up with a troublesome fellow name Bane. 
He traveled with Bane for many years, and one day they returned to Thesden. 
Upon their arrival LightsBane noticed somethin different, their were many
more Vro'ath then before.  A group of slavers and warriors named Varruk had
entered the area.  In Varruk he found a new god, THE god.  It was what he
had been searching for his entire life.  He also found that many of his
fellow Vro'ath from the Knights of Takhisis had already found their way
here.  And the god he found was Ne'shajh, the god of the Vro'ath.  Here in
Varruk his honor and courage he found in the long lost clans from which he
came has served him well, and LightsBane has ascended high in the ranks of
the Varruk because of it.  Now, as time has passed, he is one of the longest
standing members of the Varruk.  Unfortunatly, his history has give him a
great deal of patience when dealing with other races, and a more rational
attitude towarads them; though he usually only speaks with them formeans of
trading and parleying.
And as it has always been with him, his word is his bond.
Oh, and as usual, he is still looking for things to kill, and is also looking for any interesting or rare trinkets you might wish to sell him.
