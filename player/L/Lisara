Vers 8
Desc `oLong light `bred`` `ohair spills down this womans back to her waist. 
It accents her light `mpurple`` `oeyes and unblemished ivory skin.  `oHeight
being her disadvantage she stand only 5 foot 3 inches tall.  Quiet and
keeping to herself she just watches the people around her sometimes smiling
softly.  `oYou notice the mark on her left ring finger that can only be left
by wearing a `kring`` `ofor many years.  `oHer `meyes`` `otells of the
sadness and triumph she has hade in her life.  The idea of approaching her
fleetingly crosses your mind but is dismissed just as quickly.  `oYou are
more content to watch her quietly without disturbing her thoughts``

Bcry  `kIn the name of the ALMIGHTY!!``~
Plan  My birth name is Lisara Mandine Liwellan.  I am unsure of the place of my
birth.  I do know my family had a small farm outside of a beautiful city
many weeks travel from Thesden.  My mother and father were nothing
remarkable.  Just a man Erkai Liwellan and his wife Theatana trying to
survive.  I was born a twin.  My brothers name is Tasore Liwellan.  We lived
in ignorant happiness , my brother and I , for 13 years of our lives.  Just
before spring began to fade our farm was raided by slave traders.  I was
hidden inside of a hollow oak tree.  I cried as I listened to them slaughter
my family When they began to search and loot one found me.  I was yanked out
by my hair put in shackles and thrown on the back of one of their horses.  I
lived with them in slavery for 3 years.  Through out that time I refused to
speak.  They believed me mute and stupid.  When I turned 16 I was sold.  A
human man bought me and took me to his grandfather Mekriel.  The grandson
lived far away and could not care for his grandfather's farm as well as his
own.  I was left there to take care of the outside work and the housework. 
The old man just watched me without saying anything.  His eyes sent a
message of understanding and sympathy for me.  It took me over a year to
speak to Mekriel.  He would just speak as though to himself.  When I spoke
out and answered him one day he just smiled and kept on going as though
nothing had happened.  Mekriel was my new family and the farm had begun to
feel like home.  Until the day Mekriel walked with me to the barn and took
out two short swords from a hidden room in the floor.  He threw one at my
feet and asked me if I knew how to fight.  When I shook my head silently my
training began.  Mekriel taught me the art of swordplay and drilled it in to
my head and my heart.  He also taught me about the Almighty and the meaning
of fighting for the good of all people and the erradication of evil. 
Mekriel died in his sleep when I was 21 after only five short years
together.  I buried my mentor and soon grew restless at the farm with only
his spirit for company.  So I packed up my sword and sold the farm.  With
the money I got a horse and supplies and struck out.  My travels evetually
brought me here to Thesden where I joined Alliant.  I soon fell deeply in
love with Warren Augustus Reiger.  He was then the leader of Alliant and I
only a brand new Knight.  We were married and soon gave birth to a son whom
we named Justice.  Very soon after that our marriage began to fall apart. 
One or the other was always away and we began to fight bitterly.  We were
seperated a long time before we got a divorce.  Alliant was disbanned
because many people were gone.  Abandoning our clan and our cause.  I left
myself but returned a year later to find Xeroth a Knight of Alliant still
here.  Together we began to rebuild Alliant.  While doing so we have come to
believe all the events that had taken place were meant to be.  Our clan may
be small but it is beginning to become strong once again.  Myself and Xeroth
are going slow but I love him very much.  I believe that his feelings are
the same.  Although there are times when I miss Warren's gentle smile and
laughing blue eyes I know that we shall never reconcile our differences. 
Although I still love him and always will.
