ExDe papermsg~ `h[`kUse of Charmed Mobs`h]``
`eYou may use charmed mobs to kill other players. But keep in mind that at``
`eall times you are responsible for the actions of your charmies. This``
`emeans that if you avoid some kind of punishment by using a charmie to``
`ekill for you, you will be given the appropriate punishment by an `kImmortal`e.``
`hFurthermore, you are responsible for the actions of your mounts, pets and``
`hany charmed players to whom you have given orders.``
`eAlso, please do not bring or leave aggressive mobs within the city limits``
`eof `kThesden`e. If a player is killed by an aggressive mob which you left``
`ein `kThesden`e, you may be punished for indirect playerkilling.``
`h[`kCheating`h]``
`eCheating is the premeditated use of an imperfection or error in the game,``
`ea 'bug,' in order to gain some kind of undeserved benefit. If something``
`eseems too good to be true, it might be a 'bug,' and you should report it``
`eto an `kImmortal`e. 'Bug' abuse is a serious offense. If you are caught``
`eabusing a 'bug,' your punishment may be as severe as deletion or site-ban``
`efor a worst case scenario.``
`eThe following is a list of rules to help you avoid the use of 'bugs':``
`h*`eNever use a skill which you do not have to initiate a battle.``
`h*`eDo not use arena gear for anything other than fighting inside the arena.``
`h*`eDo not drag players into clan-flagged rooms.``
`h*`eDo not drag mobs or players through closed doors.``
`h*`eDo not group with anyone who is the opposite alignment as you.``
`h*`eVro'aths may only group with vro'aths, humans and dwarves.``
`h*`eSidhe may only group with other sidhe.``
`h*`eDo not use a skill repeatedly (spam) in an abnormal manner.``
`h*`eDo not order charmed players to use commands such as ooc and alias,``
`ewhich have nothing to do with roleplay.``
`h*`eDo not order charmed players to change their alignment.``
`h*`eDo not stock runes in personal stores.``
`h*`eDo not mask or name your pet with the same first two letters as another``
`eplayer.``
`h*`eDo not use inherent world characteristics to kill or wound mobs.``
`h*`eOnce in jail, do not escape or evade serving your sentence.``
`h[`kHarrassment and Misconduct`h]``
`eHarrassment is abusive and/or repetitious action towards another player.``
`eIt is illegal to harrass another player by sending unwanted messages over``
`eany channel. You must obey the request of any mortal if they ask you to``
`ecease communication with them through any private channel like 'tells.'``
`eIf you use a public channel like 'gossip' to harrass a player, you may``
`ebe asked to stop by an `kImmortal`e.``
`eAlso, do not harrass another player using 'emotes' or 'socials.'``
`eIf you are asked to leave a player's private room, please do so, or you``
`emay be punished for harrassment. You do not have to leave however, if``
`eyou are initiating a battle with the owner of the private room, or taking``
`esome kind of aggresive action.``
`eMisconduct is any action which has been declared by the `kImmortal`e staff``
`eas inappropriate and/or unfair. For various reasons, the following actions``
`eare unfair and/or inappropriate, thus illegal:``
`e1) Donating/clan donating your gear when death is certain to occur in the``
`enear future, such as drowning in the ocean.``
`e2) Bidding on and item which you put on auction.``
`e3) Lying to an `kImmortal`e.``
`e4) Using vulgar, foul, offensive language over public channels.``
`e5) Disobeying an `kImmortal's `edirect order.``
`e6) Purposely locking a sidhe in battle with a blunt attacker.``
`e7) Creating a 'bot' to play for you while you are away from your computer.``
`e8) Logging more than one of your characters on at the same time, multiplaying.``
`e9) Using one of your characters to assist a second one, also multiplaying.``
`e10) Spamming, repeating the same thing over and over, on any channel.``
`e11) Repeating a private coversation with an `kImmortal `eover public channels.``
`e12) Using channels for purposes other than those for which they were intended,``
`esuch as using 'ooc' for in-character communication.``
`e13) Attacking a player on an `kImmortal-run `equest, with 'quest' in their title.``
`e14) Spreading the plague in Thesden.``

`h::::::::::::::::::::::: `kThe Rules of Exodus`h :::::::::::::::::::::::::``
`h---------------------------------------------------------------------``
`eWithin the realm of `kExodus`e, there are some rules which you need to``
`eknow and follow. Everyone is welcome to join in the excitement, as long``
`eas you do not break any of the rules. If you are caught breaking a rule,``
`eyou may be punished by an `kImmortal`e. 'Ignorance' is not an acceptable``
`eexcuse for breaking a rule. If you are uncertain whether an action is``
`eagainst the rules, feel free to ask an `kImmortal`e about it.``
`h[`kIllegal Player Attacks`h]``
`ePlayers that are not clanned and not lonered have a special protection.``
`eUnder `iNO `ecircumstance are you allowed to initiate an attack on a``
`enon-clanned, non-lonered player. Also, unless they ask you, it is``
`eagainst the rules to use any skill/spell/prayer/song on them.``
`eAnd if you kill the non-clanned, non-lonered player after having``
`einitiated the combat, your punishment will be greater than if you had``
`eonly attacked and did not kill.``
`cMembers of Greenwood also have this special protection. You may not attack``
`cmembers of this clan. And Greenwood members may not attack other players.``
`eIn order to maintain this special protection, non-clanned, non-lonered``
`eplayers are forbidden to attack clanned and lonered players, and may``
`enot involve themselves in clan affairs. They are encouraged to roleplay,``
`ebut not to help one clan over another.``
`eAll characters, including clanned and lonered, who are level 8 or less``
`eare not allowed to be attacked. And, likewise, all players who are level``
`e8 or less, including members of clans and loners, are not allowed to``
`eattack other players.``
`iYou may not attack or use spells/prayers/songs on linkdead players.``
`h[`kIllegal Player Kills`h]``
`eOnly players that are in a clan or are a loner may attack and kill players``
`eoutside of the arena. `hA loner is marked with a `f[`h*`f] `hflag beside their``
`hname. To see a list of clan symbols type 'clan list.'``
`eIt is illegal to attack and kill a non-clanned, non-lonered player.``
`eAlso, you may not indirectly kill any player that is out of level, more``
`ethan eight levels above or below your level.``
`cIndirect playerkilling is the killing of another player without striking``
`cthe fatal blow yourself, or with one of your charmed mobs or mounts, during a``
`ccombat round. For the purpose of determining culpability in playerkilling``
`ccases, lethal actions have been divided into combat round actions and``
`cnon-combat round actions. Combat round actions are actions which occur``
`cduring a face to face battle, in which blows are exchanged, or, in the``
`ccase of throwing from another room, involve a weapon striking a victim.``
`cNon-combat round actions are actions which do not involve a battle or any``
`cblows being exchanged. These actions do not initiate combat.``
`eIn all cases, it is illegal to indirectly kill a player by means of any``
`enon-combat round action. An example of this is sleeping a player and``
`eletting them starve, or summoning to an ambush and not attacking them yourself.``
`eIndirect playerkilling is legal, however, if it is done by means of a``
`ecombat round action and the victim is in level, within eight levels above``
`eor below your level. An example of this is if you poison a player during``
`ecombat, and they later die as a result of being poisoned.``
`eKeep in mind that if you kill a player that is more than eight levels``
`ebelow your level, you will receive an experience loss.``
`iYou may not directly or indirectly kill linkdead players.``
`h[`kMultiKilling`h]``
`eIn order to give players time to recover from being playerkilled, it is``
`eillegal to kill the same player twice in one 12 real-hour period. However,``
`eonce a player initiates any sort of aggresive action towards another``
`eplayer, they can no longer claim protection from multikilling.``
`h[`kMultiLooting`h]``
`eIn order to give players time to recover from being looted, it is illegal``
`eto loot a player by means of charm twice in a 12 real-hour period. Unlike``
`eprotection from multikilling, protection from being charmed and looted is``
`eonly reversible if the victim states on a public channel that he/she does``
`enot want the protection.``

ExDe papermsg~ `lWelcome to the realms of `nExodus`h.  Upon entering our world,
you will notice that there is no traditional mud school or newbie zone.
It is our intention to immerse players immediately, the world around you being
your entire 'newbie area'.  Thus, reading this `bNeophyte Manifesto`h becomes
monumentally important to your prosperity and survival here.  Note that   
everything covered in this document is pursued at greater length in the  
help files. Please also type story to read something of Exodus history.

The manifesto is divided into several categories.  
To read the different parts, just type look `kkeyword`h.

You are the center of your universe.  There are many ways in which you        
can make your character unique, aside from the customization you have         
already undertaken in choosing your skills and attributes.  You can           
change your title [help title], give yourself a description [help description],
formulate a battlecry [help battlecry]  -- and you can do it all in color    
[help color].                                                   
               
When your character is born, he/she/it receives a set of low level
equipment. To see what you are wearing, type equipment.  To see what you are 
holding, type inventory.  Exodus supports full abbreviation, so if you don't 
want to type out these full commands, you can use 'eq' and 'i', respectively. 
If you should ever lose your newbie gear, you can type outfit to re-eq.      

Your character's attributes and nuances are important to your evolution as     
you rise in power and knowledge.  To see your character's score sheet,        
type score.  To see quickly how wealthy your character is, or how much        
experience you require to level, type worth.  The experience you receive      
from killing non-player-characters (NPCs), exploring the world, or            
participating in both built-in area and immortal run quests determines

ExDe world~ `o[`iThe world around you`o]`h     
There are many things in the world that you will become aware of as you       
wander about.  The world of Exodus is vast, comprised of many mystical        
lands.  [help areas]    
A few commands are necessary to master if you want to experience the    
full impact of Exodus: look, where, and who. [help look] [help where] &       
[help who] have extensive information concerning these important commands.    
    
`o[`hobjects`o]`h                                                              
Mundane and arcane items alike can be found, bought, or battled for in    
the realms of Exodus.  Although you may discover a proliferation of
telluric items within its sprawls, the luckiest adventurers may sometimes     
come across fabled treasures, rare beyond description.

Unlike many other foriegn environments, the extensive lands of Exodus are   
inhabited by both intelligent players, and...intelligent monsters.          
Instinctual animals may not offer much of a challenge, but cognizant           
creatures with actual aspects of sentience (for example, city guards,       
farmers, or soldiers) may just surprise you -- look at them, talk to them,  
do what you deem to be wise around them to see how they react.  And should  
you choose to engage in combat with them and find yourself over your head,  
you may just find that enraged farmer or cityguard hunting you down to      
finish the job.

it is always advisable to take everything with a grain of salt and             
view the world through a cynic's eyes -- even the most harmless-looking      
player can evolve into a vicious enemy in the span of a few seconds.           
Exploring the large universe that Exodus provides is a very good way          
to avoid messy conflicts with other violent players, and is strongly          
encouraged, especially to new players.                                        
                                                                             
This advice does not directly apply to players level 1 - 8 (as these        
lower-level players are protected by immortal intervention), but it           
is advisable that you begin exploring the planet early on, to get a            
grasp of the terrain and places to adventure.                                
   
Player-killing outside of the 10-level range established by the               
creators of the lands of Exodus will result in the garnering of a              
wanted flag, and possibly a trial [help justice, help laws].

ExDe place~ [Your place in the world]
After establishing your persona within the Realms of Exodus, you will
most likely be tempted to exercise your freedom and broaden your 
horizens by taking advantage of the many built-in features of the world:
  
[Clans]
Clans are groups of like-minded players that have both the willpower and
the manpower to organize themselves in objectives that may include
conquering areas, warring with other clans, and/or promoting 
a specific goal or cause. See [help clan and clan war].
  
[Homes]
You can establish private sectors for yourself, your clan, or your loved
one(s) in certain areas in the world of Exodus, for a price. This is best
done after you have become an experienced adventurer and amassed
some money. Refer to [help homes] for more information.
  
[Transportation]
The forms of transport in the Realm of Exodus are many and varied.
Elevator mechanisms coupled with moving battle machines, boats,
mounts, and magical means of transport are ways to move yourself 
around all kinds of terrain. For traditionalists, you can also walk to 
most places. Please read the following files:
[help boat, help mount, help transportation].
  
[Good places to go]
A good place for newbies to start is the Thesden Animal Exhibition 
Gardens, informally called the zoo. It is located on Welford Road,
on the far east side of Thesden. Once the pleasures of the Zoo have 
begun to pall, you can explore, hunt wabbits!, or satisfy your 
bloodthirst at Ashton Gardens (near the center of Thesden), or 
in the Eastern Plains or Sarrendale Farms (outside of the East
Gate of Thesden).
