`cThis human looks very relaxed as he leans against the marble desk, but
a closer look tells of something amiss.  His eyes are dead and unresponsive
and his facial features totally lack any sign of interest of the world
around him.  He is clad in a simple, but official-looking, tunic with
matching pants held up by a brown leather belt.  ``

Carnifex~
`aDeformed by necromancy, Carnifex is here, waiting for your arrival.``
~
`cThis is Carnifex, once a normal human seeking rank and power in some army
of a forgotten age.  Realizing that his ambition was too big for a normal
human's short life-span, he began to study the dark art of necromancy.  But
being a necromancer takes its toll.  Carnifex's body was forever changed
from the enormous amounts of negative energy flowing through it.  It was
changed to something not quite undead, but not quite alive either...  His
face was forever twisted into a grimace of smoldering pain, his skin still
intact and full of life, but instead of eyes, two dark holes bore into his
skull behind his eyelids.  Hellish green whisps of flame escape his mouth as
he breathes through his lips.  Bits of bone protrude from his otherwise
flawless white skin, sticking out of him from wounds that will never heal. 
The skin and muscle on his right arm seem to have been ripped off, exposing
the white bone underneath. 
`c
The horrible visage that is Carnifex strides back and forth but stops
suddenly as he detects your presence...  His bleeding lips stretch in a
gruesome grin.``

looks as though it was made from spider's silk and is almost ready to fall
from his dried scalp.  His arms are folded across his chest in complete
confidence.

His sword reeks with the stench of death at his side, always ready to
reap another soul from the poor fools who come to chalenge him.  He turns
his head and looks at you as though he just noticed you.  Looking within his
empty eye sockets you see cold darkness stretching infinately within him. 
It chills your heart as his evilness seems to spark like wildfire about him.

you begin to wonder what kind of hell could spawn such a being.``

On a Windy Hill~
`dWaist-high brown grass sway in the wind all around you, making it look
like the ground is moving.  Trailing the sloping hill to the south you spot
a weather-beaten windmill, catching the wind from the wast ocean.  Below the
windmill a small village sprawls around some kind of tree.  Behind you the
small pier bravely stretches out into the waters, but the lack of boats
confound you, how would an apparent fishing village survive without boats?  
`d
A ancient granite pillar rises from the grass.``

farther ahead.  The path does not look like it has been used in a long time,
though the crusted earth has withstood the spread of vegetation a broken
wagon wheel and a broken bottle lying in the middle of the path is a
testament of how seldom people climb the hill.  ``

Entering the Village~
`dThe village shows no sign of life from the outside, if it was not for
the neatly kept street and the intact windows, one might think that this was
a ghost town.  The wind in your back brings the scent of the sea to your
nostrils, but when you breathe in you sense the smell of freshly baked
bread.
`d
`d  A rickety shed is to the east, seemingly a place to house a carriage, though
a carriage would do little good in this village on the edge of the world.``

stone buildings.  White plastered structures reflect the sun's brilliant
rays upon the street.  A criss-cross of dark brown, nearly black, wooden
panels frame the small windows and black iron balconies on the second floor.
On the rail of each balcony planters with an abundancy of crimson red
flowers can be seen.  And in the shade provided by the walls of the
buildings high-seated benches rise from a thin patch of grass.  You still
cannot see any villagers, nor any animals or birds in the sky, something
seems out of place...  ``

The Sleeping Lamb Inn~
`dYou find yourself in a cramped room with a low ceiling.  The
window-less walls seem to lean inwards in an attempt to crush you.  No
paintings adorn the walls, but the blue and yellow maze-patterned`h carpet`d
on the floor makes up for the lack of decor.  A ridiculously small marble`h
desk`d sits next to the great stairs.  So this is the inn.  You are not

on the wind from the bakery, down the street to the south.  Across the
street there is a house that looks completely deserted, the rooms that can
be seen through the windows are bare, but the door to the house is wide

oak casts its shade, a gently sloping alley squeezes its way between two
tall buildings to the east, down towards a brown lake.  The cobblestones are
worn by the feet of several generations of villagers visiting the bakery to
the west.  ``

The wide oven, in which a dozen loaves of bread would easily fit, also
radiates the flickering light of a roaring fire.  The air is thick with the
fragrance of newly baked bread.  The bakery's wares lie enveloped on
checkered cloths on benches along all but the western wall.  Except the
crackling of the fire, the shop is quiet and peaceful.  ``

A Deep Alley~
`dLacking the rats and refuse you would find in a city, this alley is
rather boring in comparision.  The walls on either side consist of an
irregular mosaic of stones, fitting together as if cut from the very same
block of granite.  Above, a pale sea sky can be seen, framed in by the
`dshadowed edges of the roof-tops.``

Square of the Star~
`dA mighty oak spread its leafless branches above, its trunk disappearing
down into the ground through the cobblestones of the square, a square that
is, in fact, round.  Mystical iron patterns snake through the square in the
shape of a five-pointed star.  Blood-red sap seeps out of recently made
puncture wounds in the tree's bark.  The holes almost look like the crying
eyes of some deformed and dying animal.  The oak twitches in response to the
suddenly chilling wind.  ``

stain of mead under the taps of the barrels behind the bar.  On every table,
candles are placed on clean tablecloths.  This tavern has somehow evaded
all signs that that costumers would leave behind.

fireplace.  A large black stain is barely visible by the door, and on the
opposite wall, two crumbled-up blankets lie.  Smashed furniture lie in a

dwindling fire.  ``

`dThe cobblestones of the village have here given way to a stomped dirt
path that spirals around the hill, leading to the windmill.  A peaceful
`dbrook separates this slope from the village of Stillwater overpassed by a
compact log bridge.  The hillside is covered by purple heathers that have
almost overgrown the path to the top.  ``

Windmill Hill~
`dThe wind is stronger up on the hill, accompanied by soft whooshing
sounds a breeze propells the billowing sails of the windmill.  Bright yellow
perennial flowers are planted in wooden buckets with black iron handles on
the sides of the windwill door.  To the south the hilly terrain soon turns
into bare rock mountains.  And to the north, past the quaint village, rolls
the endless ocean.  ``

the well is to the south and the lake where the villager's ought to wash
their clothes is down the cliff to the east.  ``

The Well~
`dThis is the well, a small area of rock cleared of grass and soil and a
hole boring down into the earth.  A lid has been put over the hole to
prevent things, and people, from falling into the well.  There is a small
hatch that one can open to sink the nearby bucket to get water without
having to move the heavy lid itself.  ``

barely burning at all.  As the light is dwindling, the walls seem to move
closer together.  ``

`kA Fairytale - By Galadriel``~
`hOnce upon a time, there was a King.  He lived in the biggest palace in
all the lands.  This palace has a grand hall with tapestries and lots of
gold all around.  King Kingston, despite his riches, was very sad.  His
beautiful daughter, Princess Daffodil, was kidnapped by the scariest, red,
firebreathing dragon ever, Zephyrus.  The rumor is that Zephyrus took her to
the highest room in the tallest tower.  The tower is very high and very dark
and mysterious.  ``

`kAnd the journey started...``~
`hRolling green hills spread out for miles.  Far off in the distance the
dark green fog surrounds the tallest tower in the land.  To the west there
are huge green forests with twinkling lights amidst the darkness.  The path
to the north has been worn almost bare of grass.  Just next to the path
there is a large dragon clawprint embedded into the valley.  The journey to
the tower must take several days on foot.  A knight would be smart to get a
horse for that trek.  Next to the dragon's clawprint, there is a small hut
made of wood and straw.  The small elderly woman that owns the hut sits
outside all day waiting for someone to wander past and talk to her.  She is
very lonely and will probably give information for a little bit of
attention.  ``

`kFinally at the Tower!``~
`hComing over the final hill, the view is spectacular.  There stands the
beautiful red dragon, Zephyrus.  His scales glitter like rubies in the
treasure room of the palace.  His eyes are cold blue sapphire stones.  His
beauty belies the danger.  The smoke coming from his nostrils curls about
his head like the horns of a devil.  Behind the dragon stands the tallest
tower enrobed in green, dark fog.  The princess can be seen leaning on her
windowsill staring off into the distance, awaiting the day someone will come
to save her.  Zephyrus is keeping a sharp eye out for anyone with the
courage to attempt the rescue.  ``

`kInside the Tower``~
`hResidual heat fills this small room.  The dragon has been smote but the
remnants of his terror filled reign will live on for years in this building.
The fog around the tower has begun to disappate.  The only thing left to do
now is save the lovely princess Daffodil.  Along the back wall there is a
set of stone stairs that can only lead to one place.  The highest room.  The
darkness at the top is quiet and deadly.  The sense that something has been
amiss is in the air.  There is light at the top of the staircase.  A little
raven sits in his cage at the foot of the stairs.  ``

`hAt long last the quest for the princess is over.  There she is, sitting
on a bed of sumptuous pillows looking beautiful and innocent.  The journey
home will be long but certainly not dangerous now that the dragon is dead. 
With the princess along, the trip should be pleasant as well.  The King is
sure to have the reward ready and waiting for his daughter's hero.  A kiss
from the princess ends this lovely tale.  And they both live happily ever
after.  ``

room, somehow all connected to a great hexagram in the very heart of the
room.  The angry red glow that the runes emit is barely enough to light the

something not too pleasant.  ``

`gThe ceiling of the cavern looms low above the surface of the gurgling
water.  The water is collected in a natural basin.  Buckets are lined up by
the edge of the water and to the south east the grunts and pants of heavy
labor can be heard.  ``
