mutant soldier~
the mutant soldier~
A one eyed mutant soldier stands here.
~
This soldier was one of the strongest in the army of the Dark
Fortress, until the Sorceress tested some magic on her.  This
woman lost an eye, and her remaining eye moved into the 
center of her head.  She is a dangerous warrior, and is quite
upset that she will have to spend the remainder of her life
in the wastelands.

the mutant dragon~
The Mutant Dragon grins, thinking of how you will taste.
~
This is the most hideous of the Sorceress's experiements.  She
took a very powerful dragon and twisted its lifeforce trying to
make the ultimate mount for combat.  However, the dragon
went insane.  Too powerful to be destroyed, she had this
room built to cage it.  The mutant dragon continues to go 
insane as it realizes that it will never escape this room.

`aEntering the Temple of the Phalanx``~
`hDust swirls in air as you come down the stairs of this ancient temple. 
And even though it seems to have been abandoned for a millenia, one should
not underestimate ancient technology.  This temple is bound to be riddled by
traps and perhaps even a magical guardian.  Further down the stairs darkness
rules, yet the sounds of movement echo faintly from below.  ``

`aThe Room of Fire``~
`hThis room is extremely hot, in fact, the only person who could ever
live in such an enviorment would be a litan.  You feel your equipment
turning warmer by the second, perhaps you should leave as soon as
possible...  ``

much grander living quarters.  Gleaming swords hang on the walls richly
adorned with heavy jewels and the scabbard painted in bright metallic
colors.  On top of the marble desktop sits many trinkets that move on their
own, emitting vague clinking sounds.  ``
