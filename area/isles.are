The hawkman, like all of his kind wears a beaked helm, chain leggings,
and is naked from the waist up. He wears the talons of the hawkpeople,
a glove fitted with spikes on the fingers. Huge grey wings grow from his
back, which when extended span 12' from tip to tip.

A pirate is here, tossing his fate with dice.

The pirate is playing a game involving 3 dice called 'bones' in which
the highest total wins, with the variant that 2 of a kind forfeits your
roll, and 3 of a kind gets a bonus roll added. He is so involved in the
game that he did not notice you enter.

the first mate~
A pirate in the tattered remains of a uniform, glares at your intrusion.

The first mate once was an officer in the navy of Freeport, who in his 
later years took to skimming from the war fund. One day justice caught 
up with him and he was captured and shipped back to port. However, on the 
way, his ship was captured by Lord Vulture, who recognized potential in 
his captive. The mate has served Lord Vulture well, informing him of 
standard military moves of the navy.

nudged him and he broke out of his block. With Rainman
doing the main debugging and alot of dark beer, this
area was created for your amusement. Then Starbird got
hold of it and converted it to Rom2.4 format. The secret 
to sailing is that all simple seas never border on grounding 
reefs. If you are in shallows type exit after each move to 
look for shoals ( they wont show in the night ). There is a 
main clockwise current running in the high seas, so don't 
sleep on the high seas, or you will drift.. There are alot 
of clues throughout isles so don't just powermud and miss all.
Lok charmed me so you wouldn't just mindlessly butcher me.'

inscription strange rock~
Carved into the rock in wizard runes is the following:
` BEWARE-Enchanted Lodestone: I was on holiday on this 
deserted island, practicing on my enchantment spells, 
when in the middle of casting, I was rudely interrupted by
a mystic summons. The interruption threw my spell off target
and onto the island itself. With a wrenching crunch the whole
island rose from the sea to the position you find it now. 
Intrigued by the phenomena I took a sample of the rock back
to my shack in the Forest Arden, where I determined by 
methods of alchemy that the island had rich deposits of
lodestone, which when subjected to enchantment magic, flies.
I have used this discovery to create several floating trinkets
which impart the ability of flying to the recipient. Beware
for I know not how long this enchantment will last. - MERLIN'

You are in a sparsely furnished room, obviously occupied by men at arms.
Low pallets are on the north and south walls. A small fire glows in
a pit in the room center, and the smoke winds its way upward and out
a high iron barred window. Near the window is a platform from which

You are sailing the sea of ice. Ahead the narrow channel widens next
to a very large iceberg. Ice shears in sheets from the iceberg to crash
with a thunderous roar into the frosty sea. You think you can make out 
a dark watery cave leading into the iceberg.

You have sailed into the heart of the iceberg, out of the frosty wind.
You feel warmth returning to your bones, and you welcome the quiet 
splendor of the ice interior. Next to you in the cave are several triremes
anchored at bay. You anchor and hop down onto the hard packed ice, 
following a trail of footprints to a dead end passage. Puzzled, you get on
your hands and knees, and feel the outline of an ice trap door beneath you.

At the Bonfire in the Great Ice Cavern~
You stand next to a roaring bonfire in the great ice cavern. Logs some ten 
feet in length are stacked crosswise to a height of 5'. The flames warm and 
light the cavern, and most importantly, your backside. Bedrolls are cast 
about the fire, and primitive shelving has been carved into the surrounding 
stalagmites. The heat from the fire is so great that it has melted the ice into
a pool of water.
