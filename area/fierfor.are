to lead her to an inn or civilization where she may rest.  Her armor is
dull, hair grimy - she looks as if she has been travelling for quite some
time.

A gurgling font~
Water blasts out of a medium-sized hole in a rock here, arcing southward
and coalescing into a messy pool before flowing into the narrow stream
in the distance.  From the look and smell of the water, it seems to be
coming from some underground source rather than the sea.  Large chunks
of rock spray outwards periodically as well, making it necessary to
avoid the source.

In the shadow of the Forest Fierense~
A tiny prickling sensation runs down your back as you stride through         
the shade of several gigantic trees.  Adjusting your armor to allow          
long, sticky dead needles to fall out, you quickly snap your head upwards    
to examine the gargantuans that continually shed these stinging invaders.    
The trunks of these titans are covered in a seemingly impenetrable shield    
of thick, peeling bark that creeps upward to meet perfectly circular         
canopies of bushy, draping needles.  Sunlight filters through the            
shade in spots, creating a strange shadow map on the floor that transforms   
around your shadow as you walk.

In the shadow of the Forest Fierense~
The strong scent of pine resin fills the air.  Nearby a huge old tree stands
ruined; it must have been struck by lighning.  The topmost branches have
been blasted away, the lower branches burned.  White sap runs down the
trunk, scenting the air.  The lower needles have begun to brown.  As your
next step crunches a soft flapping sound starts behind you.  A white owl
flies past, out of a hole in a nearby trunk.  It turns and soars up to a
branch, where it perches to regard you with massive, yellow, unblinking
eyes.  Small owls scratch and hoot from the hole the parent just left.

Long, swinging branches filled with bunches of dense green needles make      
it necessary to dodge and duck as you make your way through the thick        
foliage and treelife of this forest.  Huge, thin-trunked trees grow          
in tandem with medium-sized ones at ground level, with large gaps of         
open space in between where browning needle-filled trees of intermediate     
size grow fitfully in the sunlight.

In the shadow of the Forest Fierense~
This part of the forest seems very old.  All the trees are enormous, many
fallen trunks cover the ground, blocking easy paths.  Some have not fallen
yet, but lean at ominous angles, ready to fall at the next storm.  One old
tree has died but still stands perfectly straight.  Denuded of all its
needles and bark it is totally white, the ghost of a tree.  In the patch of
sun around it a poplar sapling thrives among wildflowers, beginning the next
stage of forest growth.  The wind picks up a moment, whistling through the
trees, but the air at the forest floor remains completely still.  Above a
bird begins to sing, and is answered by another song, far off.

size grow fitfully in the sunlight.

In the shadow of the Forest Fierense~
A tiny prickling sensation runs down your back as you stride through         
the shade of several gigantic trees.  Adjusting your armor to allow          
long, sticky dead needles to fall out, you quickly snap your head upwards    
to examine the gargantuans that continually shed these stinging invaders.    
The trunks of these titans are covered in a seemingly impenetrable shield    
of thick, peeling bark that creeps upward to meet perfectly circular         
canopies of bushy, draping needles.  Sunlight filters through the            
shade in spots, creating a strange shadow map on the floor that transforms   
around your shadow as you walk.

In the shadow of the Forest Fierense~
Towering pillars of wood rocket upwards out of the earth, reaching           
with vaguely U-shaped branches out towards the glowing yellow sun.           
Droplets of sap ooze down at a monumentally slow rate, gleaming brightly     
as light refracts through them, leaving a glimmering trail throughout        
the branches of the trees.  As you scan up and around, the strong scent      
of pine sap invades your olfactories, making you almost drunk on the         
fumes of the woods.

Crossing a deep, narrow stream~
The cold, rocky streambed conducts the flow of inlet water between large
deposits of natural sediment and earthy soil.  The water here swirls into
strange pools as it rushes southward, creating larger waves than you
imagined could exist in a stream you could probably jump over if given
enough distance.

In the shadow of the Forest Fierense~
No sun shines through the dense needles here to reach the dry forest floor.
The soil is covered with thick carpet of brown needles.  Massive rough brown
trunks, widely spaced, surround you, their deep green branches high
overhead.  Each footstep produces a loud crunching sound, which is quickly
muffled by the surrounding pine trees.  At your feet is scattered forest
debris: mostly brown pincones of widely varying sizes, some round white
balls of bone - owl droppings.  A few small tuffets of green, of young pine
trees, somehow grow in this endless dusk.

In the shadow of the Forest Fierense~
The strong scent of pine resin fills the air.  Nearby a huge old tree stands
ruined; it must have been struck by lighning.  The topmost branches have
been blasted away, the lower branches burned.  White sap runs down the
trunk, scenting the air.  The lower needles have begun to brown.  As your
next step crunches a soft flapping sound starts behind you.  A white owl
flies past, out of a hole in a nearby trunk.  It turns and soars up to a
branch, where it perches to regard you with massive, yellow, unblinking
eyes.  Small owls scratch and hoot from the hole the parent just left.

With another step you tap a small hump in the needle-covered ground.  It
erupts suddenly into tiny grey mice, which scatter in all directions from
this assault on their nest.  Very few people must walk this way.  The wind
blows steadily, the constant hiss of needles rubbing against each other
drowns out all other sounds.  High above the pointed treetops sway wildly.
Down here the trunks are so huge two men could stand shoulder-to-shoulder on
one side, and not be visible on the opposite.  Not even the tips of branches
flutter at this level.  Fleeting spots of sunlight appear for a moment,
shining on the brown needle-carpet of the ground then dance away and flicker
out of existence.

In the shadow of the Forest Fierense~
This part of the forest seems very old.  All the trees are enormous, many
fallen trunks cover the ground, blocking easy paths.  Some have not fallen
yet, but lean at ominous angles, ready to fall at the next storm.  One old
tree has died but still stands perfectly straight.  Denuded of all its
needles and bark it is totally white, the ghost of a tree.  In the patch of
sun around it a poplar sapling thrives among wildflowers, beginning the next
stage of forest growth.  The wind picks up a moment, whistling through the
trees, but the air at the forest floor remains completely still.  Above a
bird begins to sing, and is answered by another song, far off.

Crossing a deep, narrow stream~
Quick splashes of water wet you as you cross the soft riverbed.  Darting
shadows of odd fish and amphibian creatures add to the odd effect that
the stream creates of being both dangerous and life-harboring.  The blue
fluid also seems to carry reeds and logs along with amphibious life,
acting as a conduit for logs to flow down, to their destination southward.

Crossing a deep, narrow stream~
A bubble floats up to the surface of this narrow river and explodes
as you approach, sending a spray of water into the air.  All around you
is chaos in the midst of the serene forest, as water sloshes violently
down the path set for it by nature.  Logs from the thin-trunked trees
navigate slowly down the curvy stream, bobbing and diving within the
water.

A logging camp~
Fallen trees litter the area, slanting at odd angles and leaning on other
uncut specimens.  Huge glinting steel axes protrude from the trunks of some
of them, guarded by the sleeping giants of men that work to cut them down. 
Scattered amongst the raw lumber and men are short bearskin tents that offer
a brief refuge to these men from dusk until the next long day.  A faintly
unpleasant odor comes from the north.

Lean-tos made of hastily put-together logs and animal skins complete the
strange, distracted appearance of this near-treeless area of the forest.
Great stacks of logs, lathed together in their centers, fill your vision
in every direction, waiting to be dragged southwards to the timber run.
Stray pieces of fir branches sting your legs as you cautiously navigate
through the mess.

overhead.  Each footstep produces a loud crunching sound, which is quickly
muffled by the surrounding pine trees.  At your feet is scattered forest
debris: mostly brown pincones of widely varying sizes, some round white
balls of bone - owl droppings.  A few small tuffets of green, of young pine
trees, somehow grow in this endless dusk.

In the shadow of the Forest Fierense~
Long, swinging branches filled with bunches of dense green needles make      
it necessary to dodge and duck as you make your way through the thick        
foliage and treelife of this forest.  Huge, thin-trunked trees grow          
in tandem with medium-sized ones at ground level, with large gaps of         
open space in between where browning needle-filled trees of intermediate     
size grow fitfully in the sunlight.

In the shadow of the Forest Fierense~
With another step you tap a small hump in the needle-covered ground.  It
erupts suddenly into tiny grey mice, which scatter in all directions from
this assault on their nest.  Very few people must walk this way.  The wind
blows steadily, the constant hiss of needles rubbing against each other
drowns out all other sounds.  High above the pointed treetops sway wildly.
Down here the trunks are so huge two men could stand shoulder-to-shoulder on
one side, and not be visible on the opposite.  Not even the tips of branches
flutter at this level.  Fleeting spots of sunlight appear for a moment,
shining on the brown needle-carpet of the ground then dance away and flicker
out of existence.

Crossing a deep, narrow stream~
Quick splashes of water wet you as you cross the soft riverbed.  Darting
shadows of odd fish and amphibian creatures add to the odd effect that
the stream creates of being both dangerous and life-harboring.  The blue
fluid also seems to carry reeds and logs along with amphibious life,
acting as a conduit for logs to flow down, to their destination southward.

Crossing a deep, narrow stream~
A bubble floats up to the surface of this narrow river and explodes
as you approach, sending a spray of water into the air.  All around you
is chaos in the midst of the serene forest, as water sloshes violently
down the path set for it by nature.  Logs from the thin-trunked trees
navigate slowly down the curvy stream, bobbing and diving within the
water.

The timber run~
Heavy tin buckets sit by at the top of the small rise here, filled to the
brim with slippery sediment and water from the nearby river.  A smooth,
mud-covered hill acts as a conduit for the thin fir logs that await at
its apex, and at the bottom, a water-filled basin awaits for the logs to
rest in until the southern loggers route them away.

A muddy slope framed by stable logs on either side guides the huge product
from the north down to the river south of here.  Men carrying buckets and

the long poles of wood downhill to land in the puddle of water below.  A
tiny channel guides the logs easily to the river south of here from there.

In the shadow of the Forest Fierense~
The strong scent of pine resin fills the air.  Nearby a huge old tree stands
ruined; it must have been struck by lighning.  The topmost branches have
been blasted away, the lower branches burned.  White sap runs down the
trunk, scenting the air.  The lower needles have begun to brown.  As your
next step crunches a soft flapping sound starts behind you.  A white owl
flies past, out of a hole in a nearby trunk.  It turns and soars up to a
branch, where it perches to regard you with massive, yellow, unblinking
eyes.  Small owls scratch and hoot from the hole the parent just left.

Crossing a deep, narrow stream~
The cold, rocky streambed conducts the flow of inlet water between large
deposits of natural sediment and earthy soil.  The water here swirls into
strange pools as it rushes southward, creating larger waves than you
imagined could exist in a stream you could probably jump over if given
enough distance.

In the shadow of the Forest Fierense~
This part of the forest seems very old.  All the trees are enormous, many
fallen trunks cover the ground, blocking easy paths.  Some have not fallen
yet, but lean at ominous angles, ready to fall at the next storm.  One old
tree has died but still stands perfectly straight.  Denuded of all its
needles and bark it is totally white, the ghost of a tree.  In the patch of
sun around it a poplar sapling thrives among wildflowers, beginning the next
stage of forest growth.  The wind picks up a moment, whistling through the
trees, but the air at the forest floor remains completely still.  Above a
bird begins to sing, and is answered by another song, far off.

Towering pillars of wood rocket upwards out of the earth, reaching

Droplets of sap ooze down at a monumentally slow rate, gleaming brightly

A tiny prickling sensation runs down your back as you stride through         
the shade of several gigantic trees.  Adjusting your armor to allow          
long, sticky dead needles to fall out, you quickly snap your head upwards    
to examine the gargantuans that continually shed these stinging invaders.    
The trunks of these titans are covered in a seemingly impenetrable shield    
of thick, peeling bark that creeps upward to meet perfectly circular         
canopies of bushy, draping needles.  Sunlight filters through the            
shade in spots, creating a strange shadow map on the floor that transforms   
around your shadow as you walk.

In the shadow of the Forest Fierense~
Long, swinging branches filled with bunches of dense green needles make      
it necessary to dodge and duck as you make your way through the thick        
foliage and treelife of this forest.  Huge, thin-trunked trees grow          
in tandem with medium-sized ones at ground level, with large gaps of         
open space in between where browning needle-filled trees of intermediate     
size grow fitfully in the sunlight.

In the shadow of the Forest Fierense~
A tiny prickling sensation runs down your back as you stride through         
the shade of several gigantic trees.  Adjusting your armor to allow          
long, sticky dead needles to fall out, you quickly snap your head upwards    
to examine the gargantuans that continually shed these stinging invaders.    
The trunks of these titans are covered in a seemingly impenetrable shield    
of thick, peeling bark that creeps upward to meet perfectly circular         
canopies of bushy, draping needles.  Sunlight filters through the            
shade in spots, creating a strange shadow map on the floor that transforms   
around your shadow as you walk.

In the shadow of the Forest Fierense~
No sun shines through the dense needles here to reach the dry forest floor.
The soil is covered with thick carpet of brown needles.  Massive rough brown
trunks, widely spaced, surround you, their deep green branches high
overhead.  Each footstep produces a loud crunching sound, which is quickly
muffled by the surrounding pine trees.  At your feet is scattered forest
debris: mostly brown pincones of widely varying sizes, some round white
balls of bone - owl droppings.  A few small tuffets of green, of young pine
trees, somehow grow in this endless dusk.

Crossing a deep, narrow stream~
Quick splashes of water wet you as you cross the soft riverbed.  Darting
shadows of odd fish and amphibian creatures add to the odd effect that
the stream creates of being both dangerous and life-harboring.  The blue
fluid also seems to carry reeds and logs along with amphibious life,
acting as a conduit for logs to flow down, to their destination southward.

A lumber mill~
`dThis rather large structure looms almost directly over the river, allowing
men to pull misshapen, uncut, or rotten logs from the stream before they
reach the second mill.  The logs are then cut into thick boards and shipped
via wagon to the next lumber camp site, to make tents and lean-tos from.
An inch worth of thick wood dust coats the floor, causing you to leave
deep tracks as you maneuver through the site.``

In the shadow of the Forest Fierense~
This part of the forest seems very old.  All the trees are enormous, many
fallen trunks cover the ground, blocking easy paths.  Some have not fallen
yet, but lean at ominous angles, ready to fall at the next storm.  One old
tree has died but still stands perfectly straight.  Denuded of all its
needles and bark it is totally white, the ghost of a tree.  In the patch of
sun around it a poplar sapling thrives among wildflowers, beginning the next
stage of forest growth.  The wind picks up a moment, whistling through the
trees, but the air at the forest floor remains completely still.  Above a
bird begins to sing, and is answered by another song, far off.

Crossing a deep, narrow stream~
The cold, rocky streambed conducts the flow of inlet water between large
deposits of natural sediment and earthy soil.  The water here swirls into
strange pools as it rushes southward, creating larger waves than you
imagined could exist in a stream you could probably jump over if given
enough distance.

In the shadow of the Forest Fierense~
The strong scent of pine resin fills the air.  Nearby a huge old tree stands
ruined; it must have been struck by lighning.  The topmost branches have
been blasted away, the lower branches burned.  White sap runs down the
trunk, scenting the air.  The lower needles have begun to brown.  As your
next step crunches a soft flapping sound starts behind you.  A white owl
flies past, out of a hole in a nearby trunk.  It turns and soars up to a
branch, where it perches to regard you with massive, yellow, unblinking
eyes.  Small owls scratch and hoot from the hole the parent just left.

Crossing a deep, narrow stream~
A bubble floats up to the surface of this narrow river and explodes
as you approach, sending a spray of water into the air.  All around you
is chaos in the midst of the serene forest, as water sloshes violently
down the path set for it by nature.  Logs from the thin-trunked trees
navigate slowly down the curvy stream, bobbing and diving within the
water.

A logging camp~
Shards of shaved wood core and bark cover the area in a strange green and
yellow carpet -- a hybrid of wood and grass that emits an odd pine and dust
odor.  Animal-skin tents and lean-tos house weary timber-cutters, while
others work to destroy the few trees that exist on this landscape.  Stacks
of bundled logs sit southward, waiting for the runners to drag to the river.

A logging camp~
Fallen trees litter the area, slanting at odd angles and leaning on other
uncut specimens.  Huge glinting steel axes protrude from the trunks of some
of them, guarded by the sleeping giants of men that work to cut them down.
Scattered amongst the raw lumber and men are short bearskin tents that offer
a brief refuge to these men from dusk until the next long day.

In the shadow of the Forest Fierense~
With another step you tap a small hump in the needle-covered ground.  It
erupts suddenly into tiny grey mice, which scatter in all directions from
this assault on their nest.  Very few people must walk this way.  The wind
blows steadily, the constant hiss of needles rubbing against each other
drowns out all other sounds.  High above the pointed treetops sway wildly.
Down here the trunks are so huge two men could stand shoulder-to-shoulder on
one side, and not be visible on the opposite.  Not even the tips of branches
flutter at this level.  Fleeting spots of sunlight appear for a moment,
shining on the brown needle-carpet of the ground then dance away and flicker
out of existence.

In the shadow of the Forest Fierense~
The strong scent of pine resin fills the air.  Nearby a huge old tree stands
ruined; it must have been struck by lighning.  The topmost branches have
been blasted away, the lower branches burned.  White sap runs down the
trunk, scenting the air.  The lower needles have begun to brown.  As your
next step crunches a soft flapping sound starts behind you.  A white owl
flies past, out of a hole in a nearby trunk.  It turns and soars up to a
branch, where it perches to regard you with massive, yellow, unblinking
eyes.  Small owls scratch and hoot from the hole the parent just left.

With another step you tap a small hump in the needle-covered ground.  It
erupts suddenly into tiny grey mice, which scatter in all directions from
this assault on their nest.  Very few people must walk this way.  The wind
blows steadily, the constant hiss of needles rubbing against each other
drowns out all other sounds.  High above the pointed treetops sway wildly.
Down here the trunks are so huge two men could stand shoulder-to-shoulder on
one side, and not be visible on the opposite.  Not even the tips of branches
flutter at this level.  Fleeting spots of sunlight appear for a moment,
shining on the brown needle-carpet of the ground then dance away and flicker
out of existence.

In the shadow of the Forest Fierense~
A tiny prickling sensation runs down your back as you stride through         
the shade of several gigantic trees.  Adjusting your armor to allow          
long, sticky dead needles to fall out, you quickly snap your head upwards    
to examine the gargantuans that continually shed these stinging invaders.    
The trunks of these titans are covered in a seemingly impenetrable shield    
of thick, peeling bark that creeps upward to meet perfectly circular         
canopies of bushy, draping needles.  Sunlight filters through the            
shade in spots, creating a strange shadow map on the floor that transforms   
around your shadow as you walk.

In the shadow of the Forest Fierense~
This part of the forest seems very old.  All the trees are enormous, many
fallen trunks cover the ground, blocking easy paths.  Some have not fallen
yet, but lean at ominous angles, ready to fall at the next storm.  One old
tree has died but still stands perfectly straight.  Denuded of all its
needles and bark it is totally white, the ghost of a tree.  In the patch of
sun around it a poplar sapling thrives among wildflowers, beginning the next
stage of forest growth.  The wind picks up a moment, whistling through the
trees, but the air at the forest floor remains completely still.  Above a
bird begins to sing, and is answered by another song, far off.

Crossing a deep, narrow stream~
The cold, rocky streambed conducts the flow of inlet water between large
deposits of natural sediment and earthy soil.  The water here swirls into
strange pools as it rushes southward, creating larger waves than you
imagined could exist in a stream you could probably jump over if given
enough distance.

A small mill~
A small part of the stream is routed through here, and the grate outside
assures that all of the lumber from the north flows through here before
it meets the stream again.  Men on either side of the watery ditch turn
the logs over as they come through, stopping them and peeling off giant
strips of wet bark before sending the logs floating out of the south
gate back into the river.  Sticky strips of mud, sap, and water-coated
bark cover the entire floor here, giving off a foul odor.

Towering pillars of wood rocket upwards out of the earth, reaching           
with vaguely U-shaped branches out towards the glowing yellow sun.           
Droplets of sap ooze down at a monumentally slow rate, gleaming brightly     
as light refracts through them, leaving a glimmering trail throughout        
the branches of the trees.  As you scan up and around, the strong scent      
of pine sap invades your olfactories, making you almost drunk on the         
fumes of the woods.

Long, swinging branches filled with bunches of dense green needles make      
it necessary to dodge and duck as you make your way through the thick        
foliage and treelife of this forest.  Huge, thin-trunked trees grow          
in tandem with medium-sized ones at ground level, with large gaps of         
open space in between where browning needle-filled trees of intermediate

In the shadow of the Forest Fierense~
No sun shines through the dense needles here to reach the dry forest floor.
The soil is covered with thick carpet of brown needles.  Massive rough brown
trunks, widely spaced, surround you, their deep green branches high
overhead.  Each footstep produces a loud crunching sound, which is quickly
muffled by the surrounding pine trees.  At your feet is scattered forest
debris: mostly brown pincones of widely varying sizes, some round white
balls of bone - owl droppings.  A few small tuffets of green, of young pine
trees, somehow grow in this endless dusk.

Crossing a deep, narrow stream~
Quick splashes of water wet you as you cross the soft riverbed.  Darting
shadows of odd fish and amphibian creatures add to the odd effect that
the stream creates of being both dangerous and life-harboring.  The blue
fluid also seems to carry reeds and logs along with amphibious life,
acting as a conduit for logs to flow down, to their destination southward.

A sculptured dip in the stream~
A man-made curve in the river slows the bobbing logs as they flow from the
north, allowing men to strap nets around them and guide them to the
processing area nearby.  The occasional thin log slips by and plummets down
the stream to be stopped by backup workers farther down.  Mud on the slopes
here is particularly unstable, due to the unnatural curvature of the stream.

Crossing a deep, narrow stream~
Quick splashes of water wet you as you cross the soft riverbed.  Darting
shadows of odd fish and amphibian creatures add to the odd effect that
the stream creates of being both dangerous and life-harboring.  The blue
fluid also seems to carry reeds and logs along with amphibious life,
acting as a conduit for logs to flow down, to their destination southward.

In the shadow of the Forest Fierense~
A tiny prickling sensation runs down your back as you stride through         
the shade of several gigantic trees.  Adjusting your armor to allow          
long, sticky dead needles to fall out, you quickly snap your head upwards    
to examine the gargantuans that continually shed these stinging invaders.    
The trunks of these titans are covered in a seemingly impenetrable shield    
of thick, peeling bark that creeps upward to meet perfectly circular         
canopies of bushy, draping needles.  Sunlight filters through the            
shade in spots, creating a strange shadow map on the floor that transforms   
around your shadow as you walk.

Long, swinging branches filled with bunches of dense green needles make      
it necessary to dodge and duck as you make your way through the thick        
foliage and treelife of this forest.  Huge, thin-trunked trees grow          
in tandem with medium-sized ones at ground level, with large gaps of         
open space in between where browning needle-filled trees of intermediate     
size grow fitfully in the sunlight.

In the shadow of the Forest Fierense~
The strong scent of pine resin fills the air.  Nearby a huge old tree stands
ruined; it must have been struck by lighning.  The topmost branches have
been blasted away, the lower branches burned.  White sap runs down the
trunk, scenting the air.  The lower needles have begun to brown.  As your
next step crunches a soft flapping sound starts behind you.  A white owl
flies past, out of a hole in a nearby trunk.  It turns and soars up to a
branch, where it perches to regard you with massive, yellow, unblinking
eyes.  Small owls scratch and hoot from the hole the parent just left.

In the shadow of the Forest Fierense~
This part of the forest seems very old.  All the trees are enormous, many
fallen trunks cover the ground, blocking easy paths.  Some have not fallen
yet, but lean at ominous angles, ready to fall at the next storm.  One old
tree has died but still stands perfectly straight.  Denuded of all its
needles and bark it is totally white, the ghost of a tree.  In the patch of
sun around it a poplar sapling thrives among wildflowers, beginning the next
stage of forest growth.  The wind picks up a moment, whistling through the
trees, but the air at the forest floor remains completely still.  Above a
bird begins to sing, and is answered by another song, far off.

With another step you tap a small hump in the needle-covered ground.  It
erupts suddenly into tiny grey mice, which scatter in all directions from
this assault on their nest.  Very few people must walk this way.  The wind
blows steadily, the constant hiss of needles rubbing against each other
drowns out all other sounds.  High above the pointed treetops sway wildly.
Down here the trunks are so huge two men could stand shoulder-to-shoulder on
one side, and not be visible on the opposite.  Not even the tips of branches
flutter at this level.  Fleeting spots of sunlight appear for a moment,
shining on the brown needle-carpet of the ground then dance away and flicker
out of existence.

The wood-processing area~
Timbermen with huge axes work to split the logs from the north into
smaller, manageable cylinders, before sending them down to the final
plant off the river.  Rotten pieces of wood sit in a stack in the corner,
waiting to be split by the men at night to turn into tinder and insect
harvesters.  South of here, the logs enter the river again through a
small tunnel burrowed out of the side of the ground.

A sculptured dip in the stream~
A man-made curve in the river slows the bobbing logs as they flow from the
north, allowing men to strap nets around them and guide them to the
processing area nearby.  The occasional thin log slips by and plummets down
the stream to be stopped by backup workers farther down.  Mud on the slopes
here is particularly unstable, due to the unnatural curvature of the stream.

A processing camp~
Men stand vigilant at the river's edge, poised to grab any unpeeled logs
from the stream with their forked staff-nets.  The occasional log that goes
by and is deemed unsatisfactory is cause for the men to rush into immediate
action.  The forked staffs fly into the water, directly under the log, and
with a heave it is leveraged onto the far shore, to be picked up later
for reprocessing.

strange pools as it rushes southward, creating larger waves than you

Crossing a deep, narrow stream~
A bubble floats up to the surface of this narrow river and explodes
as you approach, sending a spray of water into the air.  All around you
is chaos in the midst of the serene forest, as water sloshes violently
down the path set for it by nature.  Logs from the thin-trunked trees
navigate slowly down the curvy stream, bobbing and diving within the
water.

A small mill~
Routing the logs flowing through the stream into a small platform area
via a man-made canal, men dump a thick animal-fat glaze over every passing
piece of cut timber, and then allow them to re-enter the stream.  Due to
the large amounts of lard needed for this, animals are slain on the spot
here, giving this area a strange, foul odor.

In the shadow of the Forest Fierense~
Towering pillars of wood rocket upwards out of the earth, reaching           
with vaguely U-shaped branches out towards the glowing yellow sun.           
Droplets of sap ooze down at a monumentally slow rate, gleaming brightly     
as light refracts through them, leaving a glimmering trail throughout        
the branches of the trees.  As you scan up and around, the strong scent      
of pine sap invades your olfactories, making you almost drunk on the         
fumes of the woods.

In the shadow of the Forest Fierense~
No sun shines through the dense needles here to reach the dry forest floor.
The soil is covered with thick carpet of brown needles.  Massive rough brown
trunks, widely spaced, surround you, their deep green branches high
overhead.  Each footstep produces a loud crunching sound, which is quickly
muffled by the surrounding pine trees.  At your feet is scattered forest
debris: mostly brown pincones of widely varying sizes, some round white
balls of bone - owl droppings.  A few small tuffets of green, of young pine
trees, somehow grow in this endless dusk.

Crossing a deep, narrow stream~
The cold, rocky streambed conducts the flow of inlet water between large
deposits of natural sediment and earthy soil.  The water here swirls into
strange pools as it rushes southward, creating larger waves than you
imagined could exist in a stream you could probably jump over if given
enough distance.

fallen trunks cover the ground, blocking easy paths.  Some have not fallen

tree has died but still stands perfectly straight.  Denuded of all its

In the shadow of the Forest Fierense~
Towering pillars of wood rocket upwards out of the earth, reaching           
with vaguely U-shaped branches out towards the glowing yellow sun.           
Droplets of sap ooze down at a monumentally slow rate, gleaming brightly     
as light refracts through them, leaving a glimmering trail throughout        
the branches of the trees.  As you scan up and around, the strong scent      
of pine sap invades your olfactories, making you almost drunk on the         
fumes of the woods.

In the shadow of the Forest Fierense~
The strong scent of pine resin fills the air.  Nearby a huge old tree stands
ruined; it must have been struck by lighning.  The topmost branches have
been blasted away, the lower branches burned.  White sap runs down the
trunk, scenting the air.  The lower needles have begun to brown.  As your
next step crunches a soft flapping sound starts behind you.  A white owl
flies past, out of a hole in a nearby trunk.  It turns and soars up to a
branch, where it perches to regard you with massive, yellow, unblinking
eyes.  Small owls scratch and hoot from the hole the parent just left.

In the shadow of the Forest Fierense~
A tiny prickling sensation runs down your back as you stride through         
the shade of several gigantic trees.  Adjusting your armor to allow          
long, sticky dead needles to fall out, you quickly snap your head upwards    
to examine the gargantuans that continually shed these stinging invaders.    
The trunks of these titans are covered in a seemingly impenetrable shield    
of thick, peeling bark that creeps upward to meet perfectly circular         
canopies of bushy, draping needles.  Sunlight filters through the            
shade in spots, creating a strange shadow map on the floor that transforms   
around your shadow as you walk.

With another step you tap a small hump in the needle-covered ground.  It
erupts suddenly into tiny grey mice, which scatter in all directions from
this assault on their nest.  Very few people must walk this way.  The wind
blows steadily, the constant hiss of needles rubbing against each other
drowns out all other sounds.  High above the pointed treetops sway wildly.
Down here the trunks are so huge two men could stand shoulder-to-shoulder on
one side, and not be visible on the opposite.  Not even the tips of branches
flutter at this level.  Fleeting spots of sunlight appear for a moment,
shining on the brown needle-carpet of the ground then dance away and flicker
out of existence.

Long, swinging branches filled with bunches of dense green needles make      
it necessary to dodge and duck as you make your way through the thick        
foliage and treelife of this forest.  Huge, thin-trunked trees grow          
in tandem with medium-sized ones at ground level, with large gaps of         
open space in between where browning needle-filled trees of intermediate

Crossing a deep, narrow stream~
Quick splashes of water wet you as you cross the soft riverbed.  Darting
shadows of odd fish and amphibian creatures add to the odd effect that
the stream creates of being both dangerous and life-harboring.  The blue
fluid also seems to carry reeds and logs along with amphibious life,
acting as a conduit for logs to flow down, to their destination southward.

In the shadow of the Forest Fierense~
No sun shines through the dense needles here to reach the dry forest floor.
The soil is covered with thick carpet of brown needles.  Massive rough brown
trunks, widely spaced, surround you, their deep green branches high
overhead.  Each footstep produces a loud crunching sound, which is quickly
muffled by the surrounding pine trees.  At your feet is scattered forest
debris: mostly brown pincones of widely varying sizes, some round white
balls of bone - owl droppings.  A few small tuffets of green, of young pine
trees, somehow grow in this endless dusk.

An on-the-stream timber processing plant~
A wooden bridge hovers above this part of the stream, and men with odd
glowing poles burn sigils into the tops of passing logs.  The water
sizzles slowly south of here as the logs turn over and cool off quickly,
leaving the symbols ingrained in the wood.  To the south, you can see
a violent mass of water swirling about.

A small mill~
A grate prevents logs from flowing any further southward, and men stand
in the river before it, tossing logs out to the west to be put into
padded wagons and shipped to wherever their final destination lies.  The
impatient stamp of horses draws your attention to the large wagon team
to the west that stands, awaiting a full load.

Droplets of sap ooze down at a monumentally slow rate, gleaming brightly     
as light refracts through them, leaving a glimmering trail throughout        
the branches of the trees.  As you scan up and around, the strong scent      
of pine sap invades your olfactories, making you almost drunk on the         
fumes of the woods.

In the shadow of the Forest Fierense~
No sun shines through the dense needles here to reach the dry forest floor.
The soil is covered with thick carpet of brown needles.  Massive rough brown
trunks, widely spaced, surround you, their deep green branches high
overhead.  Each footstep produces a loud crunching sound, which is quickly
muffled by the surrounding pine trees.  At your feet is scattered forest
debris: mostly brown pincones of widely varying sizes, some round white
balls of bone - owl droppings.  A few small tuffets of green, of young pine
trees, somehow grow in this endless dusk.

In the shadow of the Forest Fierense~
This part of the forest seems very old.  All the trees are enormous, many
fallen trunks cover the ground, blocking easy paths.  Some have not fallen
yet, but lean at ominous angles, ready to fall at the next storm.  One old
tree has died but still stands perfectly straight.  Denuded of all its
needles and bark it is totally white, the ghost of a tree.  In the patch of
sun around it a poplar sapling thrives among wildflowers, beginning the next
stage of forest growth.  The wind picks up a moment, whistling through the

The Outer Trail~
`dThe dirt trail the runs along the walls of the city of Thesden turns
here, from west to south.  The trail is much narrower to the south than to
the west, thick brambles creeping in at the sides.  To the west, the trail
leads along the southern edge of a dense pine forest.  ``

A Whirlpool~
The raging water swirls in a violent mass here, spiralling downwards
into a bubbling underground stream.  From the looks of it, the pressure
inside the underground tunnel is too great for even turtles to survive
in -- and non-navigable.  In all practical respects, the river ends here.

In the shadow of the Forest Fierense~
A tiny prickling sensation runs down your back as you stride through         
the shade of several gigantic trees.  Adjusting your armor to allow          
long, sticky dead needles to fall out, you quickly snap your head upwards    
to examine the gargantuans that continually shed these stinging invaders.    
The trunks of these titans are covered in a seemingly impenetrable shield    
of thick, peeling bark that creeps upward to meet perfectly circular         
canopies of bushy, draping needles.  Sunlight filters through the            
shade in spots, creating a strange shadow map on the floor that transforms   
around your shadow as you walk.

The Darbura Trade Route~
`dDespite the thin layer of pine needles covering the ground, the road is
impossible to lose, decades upon decades of footsteps blazing this wide
route through the ancient forest.  The scent of rich soil mixes with that of
pine and cedar, filling the humid air.  Not far to the east, the road meets
the high wall and grand gates of thesden.  The route continues to the south.

The Darbura Trade Route~
`dThe well worn road of the caravan route meanders through the wood here.
The ground is packed from the thousands of hooves and wagon wheels of the
caravans and wanderers who travel this road.  The branches of the trees hang
low over the road, casting deep shadows at the edges, in which the slight
movements of the forest fauna can be detected.  The air is humid and heavy,
with only the slightest breeze moving along the trade route to distant
lands.  The route leads to the gates of Thesden not far off to the east, and
deeper into the forest to the west.  ``

`d A narrow dirt road, barely wide enough to let a wagon pass, leads off
into the woods to the west.  To the east, two towers stand on either side of
the gates of Thesden.  The low rumble of crowds pours out of the town as if
trying to disturb the peace of this quiet forest.  A short path to the north
leads to a small clearing.  ``

Before the Shimmering Sea~
With another step you tap a small hump in the needle-covered ground.  It
erupts suddenly into tiny grey mice, which scatter in all directions from
this assault on their nest.  Very few people must walk this way.  The wind
blows steadily, the constant hiss of needles rubbing against each other
drowns out all other sounds.  High above the pointed treetops sway wildly.
Down here the trunks are so huge two men could stand shoulder-to-shoulder on
one side, and not be visible on the opposite.  Not even the tips of branches
flutter at this level.  Fleeting spots of sunlight appear for a moment,
shining on the brown needle-carpet of the ground then dance away and flicker
out of existence.

The Darbura Trade Route~
`dThe well worn road provides some security in this ancient forest,
marking a clear path for men to escape the darkness of the trees.  The wood,
towering, aging trees and the distant call of an owl, is not nearly so
welcoming.  Since the elves abandoned this place, an eerie emptiness has
prevailed.  The trade route leads to the south.  A breeze from the west
carries the strong scent of the sea, salty and pungent.  ``

In the shadow of the Forest Fierense~
The strong scent of pine resin fills the air.  Nearby a huge old tree stands
ruined; it must have been struck by lighning.  The topmost branches have
been blasted away, the lower branches burned.  White sap runs down the
trunk, scenting the air.  The lower needles have begun to brown.  As your
next step crunches a soft flapping sound starts behind you.  A white owl
flies past, out of a hole in a nearby trunk.  It turns and soars up to a
branch, where it perches to regard you with massive, yellow, unblinking
eyes.  Small owls scratch and hoot from the hole the parent just left.

The Darbura Trade Route~
`dThin birch twigs and pine needles crunch and crack with each footstep. 
Flanking the road are ancient sycamores, tall graceful white birch trees,
and bushy pine trees.  The forest canopy almost reaches over the entire
road, only a tiny sliver of light penetrating it.  The road turns from east
to south here, winding deeper into the depths of the wood.  ``

The Darbura Trade Route~
`dThe packed dirt road widens here, opening into a small glade surrounded
by yew and pine trees.  Tiny patches of scallion and crab grass cling to the
sides of rocks.  A few butterflies flutter peacefully about the glade,
landing briefly on the taller grasses before taking off again.  The trade
route continues to the east and west.  At the center of the glade, a perfect
circle of tall mushrooms stand, brown and purple.  You feel an overwhelming
sense of peace, the pine needles look like a great place for a nap.  ``

The Darbura Trade Route~
`dThe well worn road provides some security in this ancient forest,
marking a clear path for men to escape the darkness of the trees.  The wood,
towering, aging trees and the distant call of an owl, is not nearly so
welcoming.  Since the elves abandoned this place, an eerie emptiness has
prevailed.  Your heart is eager to move along the route which runs from
north to west.  ``

In the shadow of the Forest Fierense~
Long, swinging branches filled with bunches of dense green needles make      
it necessary to dodge and duck as you make your way through the thick        
foliage and treelife of this forest.  Huge, thin-trunked trees grow          
in tandem with medium-sized ones at ground level, with large gaps of         
open space in between where browning needle-filled trees of intermediate     
size grow fitfully in the sunlight.

In the shadow of the Forest Fierense~
A tiny prickling sensation runs down your back as you stride through         
the shade of several gigantic trees.  Adjusting your armor to allow          
long, sticky dead needles to fall out, you quickly snap your head upwards    
to examine the gargantuans that continually shed these stinging invaders.    
The trunks of these titans are covered in a seemingly impenetrable shield    
of thick, peeling bark that creeps upward to meet perfectly circular         
canopies of bushy, draping needles.  Sunlight filters through the            
shade in spots, creating a strange shadow map on the floor that transforms   
around your shadow as you walk.

No sun shines through the dense needles here to reach the dry forest floor.
The soil is covered with thick carpet of brown needles.  Massive rough brown
trunks, widely spaced, surround you, their deep green branches high
overhead.  Each footstep produces a loud crunching sound, which is quickly
muffled by the surrounding pine trees.  At your feet is scattered forest
debris: mostly brown pincones of widely varying sizes, some round white
balls of bone - owl droppings.  A few small tuffets of green, of young pine
trees, somehow grow in this endless dusk.

impossible to lose, decades upon decades of footsteps blazing this wide

for a wagon to pass.  Tiny white wildflowers in delicate bunches and
thick-stemmed jewel weed crowd onto the edges of the road, reaching for the
light which falls through the break in the forest canopy.  A light breeze
rustles the leaves and pine needles along the road.  The road cuts through

`dThe well-worn road of the caravan route meanders through the wood.  The
ground is packed from the thousands of hooves and wagon wheels of the
caravans and wanderers who travel this road.  The branches of the tree hang
low over the road, casting deep shadows at the edges, in which the slight
movements of the forest fauna can be detected.  The air is humid and heavy,
with only the slightest breeze moving along the trade route to distant
lands.  The road curves here from north to west.  `` `dTo the south, the
Valasse trade route leads out of the forest and into the distance.  ``

In the shadow of the Forest Fierense~
This part of the forest seems very old.  All the trees are enormous, many
fallen trunks cover the ground, blocking easy paths.  Some have not fallen
yet, but lean at ominous angles, ready to fall at the next storm.  One old
tree has died but still stands perfectly straight.  Denuded of all its
needles and bark it is totally white, the ghost of a tree.  In the patch of
sun around it a poplar sapling thrives among wildflowers, beginning the next
stage of forest growth.  The wind picks up a moment, whistling through the
trees, but the air at the forest floor remains completely still.  Above a
bird begins to sing, and is answered by another song, far off.

With another step you tap a small hump in the needle-covered ground.  It
erupts suddenly into tiny grey mice, which scatter in all directions from
this assault on their nest.  Very few people must walk this way.  The wind
blows steadily, the constant hiss of needles rubbing against each other
drowns out all other sounds.  High above the pointed treetops sway wildly.
Down here the trunks are so huge two men could stand shoulder-to-shoulder on
one side, and not be visible on the opposite.  Not even the tips of branches
flutter at this level.  Fleeting spots of sunlight appear for a moment,
shining on the brown needle-carpet of the ground then dance away and flicker
out of existence.

ruined; it must have been struck by lighning.  The topmost branches have
been blasted away, the lower branches burned.  White sap runs down the

Towering pillars of wood rocket upwards out of the earth, reaching           
with vaguely U-shaped branches out towards the glowing yellow sun.           
Droplets of sap ooze down at a monumentally slow rate, gleaming brightly     
as light refracts through them, leaving a glimmering trail throughout        
the branches of the trees.  As you scan up and around, the strong scent

fumes of the woods.

In the shadow of the Forest Fierense~
Long, swinging branches filled with bunches of dense green needles make      
it necessary to dodge and duck as you make your way through the thick        
foliage and treelife of this forest.  Huge, thin-trunked trees grow          
in tandem with medium-sized ones at ground level, with large gaps of         
open space in between where browning needle-filled trees of intermediate     
size grow fitfully in the sunlight.

In the shadow of the Forest Fierense~
No sun shines through the dense needles here to reach the dry forest floor.
The soil is covered with thick carpet of brown needles.  Massive rough brown
trunks, widely spaced, surround you, their deep green branches high
overhead.  Each footstep produces a loud crunching sound, which is quickly
muffled by the surrounding pine trees.  At your feet is scattered forest
debris: mostly brown pincones of widely varying sizes, some round white
balls of bone - owl droppings.  A few small tuffets of green, of young pine
trees, somehow grow in this endless dusk.

The Valasse Trade Route~
`dThe well worn road provides some security in this ancient
forest, marking a clear path for men to escape the darkness
of the trees. The wood, towering, aging trees and the distant
call of an owl, is not nearly so welcoming. Since the elves
abandoned this place, an eerie emptiness has prevailed.
To the south, the Valasse leads out of the darkness of this wood.``

With another step you tap a small hump in the needle-covered ground.  It
erupts suddenly into tiny grey mice, which scatter in all directions from
this assault on their nest.  Very few people must walk this way.  The wind
blows steadily, the constant hiss of needles rubbing against each other
drowns out all other sounds.  High above the pointed treetops sway wildly.
Down here the trunks are so huge two men could stand shoulder-to-shoulder on
one side, and not be visible on the opposite.  Not even the tips of branches
flutter at this level.  Fleeting spots of sunlight appear for a moment,
shining on the brown needle-carpet of the ground then dance away and flicker
out of existence.

In the shadow of the Forest Fierense~
A tiny prickling sensation runs down your back as you stride through         
the shade of several gigantic trees.  Adjusting your armor to allow          
long, sticky dead needles to fall out, you quickly snap your head upwards    
to examine the gargantuans that continually shed these stinging invaders.    
The trunks of these titans are covered in a seemingly impenetrable shield    
of thick, peeling bark that creeps upward to meet perfectly circular         
canopies of bushy, draping needles.  Sunlight filters through the            
shade in spots, creating a strange shadow map on the floor that transforms   
around your shadow as you walk.

Towering pillars of wood rocket upwards out of the earth, reaching           
with vaguely U-shaped branches out towards the glowing yellow sun.           
Droplets of sap ooze down at a monumentally slow rate, gleaming brightly     
as light refracts through them, leaving a glimmering trail throughout        
the branches of the trees.  As you scan up and around, the strong scent      
of pine sap invades your olfactories, making you almost drunk on the         
fumes of the woods.

`dThe air is increasingly humid on this part of the road, the air is
humid and oppressive, like the darkness of the rest of the wood.  The ground
is soft and moist beneath your feet, increasingly so to the west where the
bayou lies.  The route leads off to the north, deep into the darkness of the
forest.  `` `dTo the west, the dirt road gets increasingly narrow and muck
covered, disappearing into the bayou.

In the shadow of the Forest Fierense~
This part of the forest seems very old.  All the trees are enormous, many
fallen trunks cover the ground, blocking easy paths.  Some have not fallen
yet, but lean at ominous angles, ready to fall at the next storm.  One old
tree has died but still stands perfectly straight.  Denuded of all its
needles and bark it is totally white, the ghost of a tree.  In the patch of
sun around it a poplar sapling thrives among wildflowers, beginning the next
stage of forest growth.  The wind picks up a moment, whistling through the
trees, but the air at the forest floor remains completely still.  Above a
bird begins to sing, and is answered by another song, far off.

The Valasse Trade Route~
`dThe well worn road of the caravan route meanders through the wood
here.  The ground is packed from the thousands of hooves and wagon wheels of
the caravans and wanderers who travel this road.  The branches of the tree
hang low over the road, casting deep shadows at the edges, in which the
slight movements of the forest fauna can be detected.  The air is humid but
cool, with only the slightest breeze moving along the trade route to distant
lands.  The Road leads out of the roads not far to the south, and deeper in
to the north.  ``

The strong scent of pine resin fills the air.  Nearby a huge old tree stands
ruined; it must have been struck by lighning.  The topmost branches have
been blasted away, the lower branches burned.  White sap runs down the
trunk, scenting the air.  The lower needles have begun to brown.  As your
next step crunches a soft flapping sound starts behind you.  A white owl
flies past, out of a hole in a nearby trunk.  It turns and soars up to a
branch, where it perches to regard you with massive, yellow, unblinking
eyes.  Small owls scratch and hoot from the hole the parent just left.

The outer woodlands~
Towering pillars of wood rocket upwards out of the earth, reaching           
with vaguely U-shaped branches out towards the glowing yellow sun.           
Droplets of sap ooze down at a monumentally slow rate, gleaming brightly     
as light refracts through them, leaving a glimmering trail throughout        
the branches of the trees.  As you scan up and around, the strong scent      
of pine sap invades your olfactories, making you almost drunk on the         
fumes of the woods.

The outer woodlands~
No sun shines through the dense needles here to reach the dry forest floor.
The soil is covered with thick carpet of brown needles.  Massive rough brown
trunks, widely spaced, surround you, their deep green branches high
overhead.  Each footstep produces a loud crunching sound, which is quickly
muffled by the surrounding pine trees.  At your feet is scattered forest
debris: mostly brown pincones of widely varying sizes, some round white
balls of bone - owl droppings.  A few small tuffets of green, of young pine
trees, somehow grow in this endless dusk.

The outer woodlands~
Long, swinging branches filled with bunches of dense green needles make      
it necessary to dodge and duck as you make your way through the thick        
foliage and treelife of this forest.  Huge, thin-trunked trees grow          
in tandem with medium-sized ones at ground level, with large gaps of         
open space in between where browning needle-filled trees of intermediate     
size grow fitfully in the sunlight.

The strong scent of pine resin fills the air.  Nearby a huge old tree stands
ruined; it must have been struck by lighning.  The topmost branches have
been blasted away, the lower branches burned.  White sap runs down the
trunk, scenting the air.  The lower needles have begun to brown.  As your
next step crunches a soft flapping sound starts behind you.  A white owl
flies past, out of a hole in a nearby trunk.  It turns and soars up to a
branch, where it perches to regard you with massive, yellow, unblinking
eyes.  Small owls scratch and hoot from the hole the parent just left.

The outer woodlands~
A tiny prickling sensation runs down your back as you stride through         
the shade of several gigantic trees.  Adjusting your armor to allow          
long, sticky dead needles to fall out, you quickly snap your head upwards    
to examine the gargantuans that continually shed these stinging invaders.    
The trunks of these titans are covered in a seemingly impenetrable shield    
of thick, peeling bark that creeps upward to meet perfectly circular         
canopies of bushy, draping needles.  Sunlight filters through the            
shade in spots, creating a strange shadow map on the floor that transforms   
around your shadow as you walk.

With another step you tap a small hump in the needle-covered ground.  It
erupts suddenly into tiny grey mice, which scatter in all directions from
this assault on their nest.  Very few people must walk this way.  The wind
blows steadily, the constant hiss of needles rubbing against each other
drowns out all other sounds.  High above the pointed treetops sway wildly.
Down here the trunks are so huge two men could stand shoulder-to-shoulder on
one side, and not be visible on the opposite.  Not even the tips of branches
flutter at this level.  Fleeting spots of sunlight appear for a moment,
shining on the brown needle-carpet of the ground then dance away and flicker
out of existence.

The outer woodlands~
This part of the forest seems very old.  All the trees are enormous, many
fallen trunks cover the ground, blocking easy paths.  Some have not fallen
yet, but lean at ominous angles, ready to fall at the next storm.  One old
tree has died but still stands perfectly straight.  Denuded of all its
needles and bark it is totally white, the ghost of a tree.  In the patch of
sun around it a poplar sapling thrives among wildflowers, beginning the next
stage of forest growth.  The wind picks up a moment, whistling through the
trees, but the air at the forest floor remains completely still.  Above a
bird begins to sing, and is answered by another song, far off.

The outer woodlands~
No sun shines through the dense needles here to reach the dry forest floor.
The soil is covered with thick carpet of brown needles.  Massive rough brown
trunks, widely spaced, surround you, their deep green branches high
overhead.  Each footstep produces a loud crunching sound, which is quickly
muffled by the surrounding pine trees.  At your feet is scattered forest
debris: mostly brown pincones of widely varying sizes, some round white
balls of bone - owl droppings.  A few small tuffets of green, of young pine
trees, somehow grow in this endless dusk.

Long, swinging branches filled with bunches of dense green needles make      
it necessary to dodge and duck as you make your way through the thick        
foliage and treelife of this forest.  Huge, thin-trunked trees grow          
in tandem with medium-sized ones at ground level, with large gaps of         
open space in between where browning needle-filled trees of intermediate     
size grow fitfully in the sunlight.

A tiny prickling sensation runs down your back as you stride through         
the shade of several gigantic trees.  Adjusting your armor to allow          
long, sticky dead needles to fall out, you quickly snap your head upwards    
to examine the gargantuans that continually shed these stinging invaders.    
The trunks of these titans are covered in a seemingly impenetrable shield    
of thick, peeling bark that creeps upward to meet perfectly circular         
canopies of bushy, draping needles.  Sunlight filters through the            
shade in spots, creating a strange shadow map on the floor that transforms   
around your shadow as you walk.

The strong scent of pine resin fills the air.  Nearby a huge old tree stands
ruined; it must have been struck by lighning.  The topmost branches have
been blasted away, the lower branches burned.  White sap runs down the
trunk, scenting the air.  The lower needles have begun to brown.  As your
next step crunches a soft flapping sound starts behind you.  A white owl
flies past, out of a hole in a nearby trunk.  It turns and soars up to a
branch, where it perches to regard you with massive, yellow, unblinking
eyes.  Small owls scratch and hoot from the hole the parent just left.

Towering pillars of wood rocket upwards out of the earth, reaching

Droplets of sap ooze down at a monumentally slow rate, gleaming brightly

needles and bark it is totally white, the ghost of a tree.  In the patch of
sun around it a poplar sapling thrives among wildflowers, beginning the next
stage of forest growth.  The wind picks up a moment, whistling through the
trees, but the air at the forest floor remains completely still.  Above a
bird begins to sing, and is answered by another song, far off.

The outer woodlands~
Towering pillars of wood rocket upwards out of the earth, reaching           
with vaguely U-shaped branches out towards the glowing yellow sun.           
Droplets of sap ooze down at a monumentally slow rate, gleaming brightly     
as light refracts through them, leaving a glimmering trail throughout        
the branches of the trees.  As you scan up and around, the strong scent      
of pine sap invades your olfactories, making you almost drunk on the         
fumes of the woods.

The outer woodlands~
A tiny prickling sensation runs down your back as you stride through         
the shade of several gigantic trees.  Adjusting your armor to allow          
long, sticky dead needles to fall out, you quickly snap your head upwards    
to examine the gargantuans that continually shed these stinging invaders.    
The trunks of these titans are covered in a seemingly impenetrable shield    
of thick, peeling bark that creeps upward to meet perfectly circular         
canopies of bushy, draping needles.  Sunlight filters through the            
shade in spots, creating a strange shadow map on the floor that transforms   
around your shadow as you walk.

Long, swinging branches filled with bunches of dense green needles make      
it necessary to dodge and duck as you make your way through the thick        
foliage and treelife of this forest.  Huge, thin-trunked trees grow          
in tandem with medium-sized ones at ground level, with large gaps of         
open space in between where browning needle-filled trees of intermediate     
size grow fitfully in the sunlight.

The outer woodlands~
No sun shines through the dense needles here to reach the dry forest floor.
The soil is covered with thick carpet of brown needles.  Massive rough brown
trunks, widely spaced, surround you, their deep green branches high
overhead.  Each footstep produces a loud crunching sound, which is quickly
muffled by the surrounding pine trees.  At your feet is scattered forest
debris: mostly brown pincones of widely varying sizes, some round white
balls of bone - owl droppings.  A few small tuffets of green, of young pine
trees, somehow grow in this endless dusk.

The strong scent of pine resin fills the air.  Nearby a huge old tree stands
ruined; it must have been struck by lighning.  The topmost branches have
been blasted away, the lower branches burned.  White sap runs down the
trunk, scenting the air.  The lower needles have begun to brown.  As your
next step crunches a soft flapping sound starts behind you.  A white owl
flies past, out of a hole in a nearby trunk.  It turns and soars up to a
branch, where it perches to regard you with massive, yellow, unblinking
eyes.  Small owls scratch and hoot from the hole the parent just left.

fallen trunks cover the ground, blocking easy paths.  Some have not fallen
yet, but lean at ominous angles, ready to fall at the next storm.  One old

With another step you tap a small hump in the needle-covered ground.  It
erupts suddenly into tiny grey mice, which scatter in all directions from
this assault on their nest.  Very few people must walk this way.  The wind
blows steadily, the constant hiss of needles rubbing against each other
drowns out all other sounds.  High above the pointed treetops sway wildly.
Down here the trunks are so huge two men could stand shoulder-to-shoulder on
one side, and not be visible on the opposite.  Not even the tips of branches
flutter at this level.  Fleeting spots of sunlight appear for a moment,
shining on the brown needle-carpet of the ground then dance away and flicker
out of existence.

debris: mostly brown pincones of widely varying sizes, some round white
balls of bone - owl droppings.  A few small tuffets of green, of young pine
trees, somehow grow in this endless dusk.

The outer woodlands~
This part of the forest seems very old.  All the trees are enormous, many
fallen trunks cover the ground, blocking easy paths.  Some have not fallen
yet, but lean at ominous angles, ready to fall at the next storm.  One old
tree has died but still stands perfectly straight.  Denuded of all its
needles and bark it is totally white, the ghost of a tree.  In the patch of
sun around it a poplar sapling thrives among wildflowers, beginning the next
stage of forest growth.  The wind picks up a moment, whistling through the
trees, but the air at the forest floor remains completely still.  Above a
bird begins to sing, and is answered by another song, far off.

The outer woodlands~
With another step you tap a small hump in the needle-covered ground.  It
erupts suddenly into tiny grey mice, which scatter in all directions from
this assault on their nest.  Very few people must walk this way.  The wind
blows steadily, the constant hiss of needles rubbing against each other
drowns out all other sounds.  High above the pointed treetops sway wildly.
Down here the trunks are so huge two men could stand shoulder-to-shoulder on
one side, and not be visible on the opposite.  Not even the tips of branches
flutter at this level.  Fleeting spots of sunlight appear for a moment,
shining on the brown needle-carpet of the ground then dance away and flicker
out of existence.

Before the Northern Gates of Thesden~
The aging thick wooden gates of Thesden stand to the south, marking the
end of the surrounding forest.  Flanking the gates, two weather-worn guard
towers rise above the walls and approach the height of the tallest trees. 
The scent of fresh pine sap blows past the gates from the north and west,
carried on a slight wind through the dense forest.  The air is cool and
refreshing, pleasingly quiet when compared with the hectic city to the
south.  A trail has been blazed along the city walls to the east.

The Outer Trail~
`dA trail has been cleared along the walls of the city here.  The tree
limbs and young sprouts have been cut back from the edge leaving a pine
needle covered dirt path just at the base of the wall.  Not far to the west,
the trail ends at the north gate of the city.  It continues into the shadowy
darkness to the east.  ``

The Outer Trail~
`dThis narrow trail is used by travelers and hunters to get around much
of the city without having to bear the crowds of the central squares.  The
ground is covered in a thin layer of pine needles and packed dusty soil.  A
number of sparrows and morning doves make their home along the top of the
wall, leaving feathers and droppings along the path and filling the air with
shrill cries.  The trail continues to the east and west, to the north, only
trees are visible far into the distance.  ``

Entrance to a Village~
An unnatural quiet permeates the forest and a subtle sense of menace
seems present.  The shadows cast by the looming trees seem just a touch
darker then they ought to be.  The air is thick with sinister scents...  Wet
earth, salt, copper, and wood smoke combine to create a cloying fragrance. 
Integrated into the surrounding forests, an exquisite and artfully crafted
`opalisade `lmarks the borders of a village which lies to the north. A
cobblestone path flows seamlessly from the forest floor and wends it way
north.  
  
Tied to the right pillar of a palisade is a corpse of what seems to be an elven
`oarcher`l. His body mangled, you lean in for a closer look.

palisade~
`hA beautifully carved marble arch over the beginning of the cobble stone path has been
`herected here.  Across the top, in beautiful elvish script is:
`h
                         `oTae Si Mel Moli Aeraesalia Ol Iar
                        `o(May the sun shine eternally upon us)
`h
`hAs you study the palisade, you notice that there are russet colored stains up and down 
`hthe sides, and under the elvish script are words that are written in the same russet 
`hcolor as what stains the beautiful pillars.  The other writings reads:
`h
                           `bOlia Os Pasaer Air Selia Aeraesar
                         `b(Only our darkness is truly eternal)

archer~
`hTied to the pillar of the marble palisade are the remains of an archer,
the sentry `hfor the village.  His body is bare, not a scrap of clothing,
and you can tell he is a man only by the `hfact that he has no breasts.  His
manhood has been removed, as have his feet and hands.  His arms are visibly
`hbroken in many different places, and the skin that covers his chest and
stomach is attached only in small `hpatches.  This sentry was the first to
meet his demise at the hands of the very powerful evil force that `hchose to
wreak havoc upon this village, and by the smile that has been cut into his
face and the sockets `hwhere his eyes used to be, you figure that he is not
the last.

A Cobblestone Path~
The cobblestone path continues to the north, and as it winds towards the
heart of the village the sense of menace grows.  The tree shaded remains of
houses lie to the east and west, completely in ruin as though rent apart by
some terrifying force.  The scents of rotten flesh as well as seared flesh
mingle in a revolting manner.  The cobbles are at various points stained
with what could only be blood.  Something terrible has happened here,
something wicked and utterly despicable.

A Cobblestone Path~
It is obvious now that this village has been the scene of a magnificent
and terrible slaughter.  More houses to the east and west, ruined as all
things in this village seem thus far.  The trees that line the cobblestone
path seem to leer down slightly, as if in witnessing the agonies inflicted
on this soil they have been tainted.  A faint buzzing fills the air, the
droning chorus of flies come to feast on the visceral and sanguineous
remnants of those fortune deemed fit to suffer heinous tortures.

corpse~
`hThe corpse of a female elf lies here, her clothing in shreds around
her.  The `bblood`h that `honce gave her life has been spilled into the
earth and onto the cobblestone path.  Her face is `hlocked in horror,
untouched from either fangs or blade.  Her right hand is still clutched to
her `hbreast, holding in it a handful of hair that is as `ablack`h as the
night, and the very ends of it `has `br`ie`bd `has the blood that has
spilled from the gaping wounds in her throat and chest.  Next to her `hhand
on her chest is a hole big enough to fit your fist in, and you notice that
in her other hand she holds `hwhat appears to be her own heart...

Center of the Village~
The cobblestone path, stained as it is in hues of russet and rust, leads
to a circular clearing.  The ground, once paved in a delicate mosaic of
stones, seems more like the floor of an abattoir.  This place, which once
was the meeting ground of the village where the elven-kin would hold their
moots and their council, has been defiled.  Only the dead converse here now,
holding grim and silent council before the defaced idol of their blasphemed
god, Avyril

statue~
`hThis beautifully crafted marble statue was once grand.  `oAyvril`h, the
god of `es`lt`oo`lr`em `hand `hplenty, was carved with great care to show
his beauty and grace, and his love of his Elven people.  `hNow, this statue
is ugly, in every sense of the word.  Carved into Ayvril's chest, arms and
legs are `hblasphemous symbols, smeared across with `bblood `hto make them
stand out all the more.  His face is `hunrecognizably clawed, with four deep
gouges starting from where his chin was and going up through to `hthe top of
his head.  The claw marks look as though they were made by a human hand, but
no human is strong `henough to destroy marble in such a way.  
~
E
adolescent~
`aThe limbs of this young male have been ripped from his body, only to be
replaced by those of some `aunknown origin.  They are still elf-like, but
they are more feminine than those that should be attached to `ato him.  They
have been crudely sewn into place.  He is wearing only pants, his back looks
as though it were `aa drawing board for someone who worked only in the
medium of pain and blood.  You can count his ribs, all `athirteen pairs, as
the bones and muscles are all visible.  His head is bowed and the hands that
are a part of the `aarms that have been sewn onto his body are held together
by ropes of brambles, as if in silent prayer.  
~

girl~
`aThis young woman was killed at the peak of her beauty.  Her face
remains untouched by the horrors `athat the rest of this village has seen. 
Her face is serene and peaceful, as if she never knew that `asuch a horrible
death awaited her.  She is still fully clothed, but all the clothing that
she wears has been `atorn into shreds.  She is lying on her back, her knees
in the air as if preparing herself for her lover.  `aAlmost every inch of
her exposed skin has been flayed, as though she was brutally whipped with
`aa flogger that had glass or nails in the ends.  Her head is resting on her
hands, her hair carefully `alaid around her head, as if in a shrine to her
beauty.

A Once Grand House~
The door to this house has been broken from its hinges by some terribly
puissant force.  The fetid scents of decay linger here, assailing the senses
as the odors come to rest upon the tongue, creating repulsive flavors that
seem to beckon bile to the lips.  The interior of this abode was once quite
pleasant.  Suggestions of a home well loved and well lived in remain as
relics hidden beneath the stains of blood and remains of viscera that have
been strewn about this place in malevolent ecstasy.  A child's doll, beds
unmade, food left out and rotting.  The pleasures of the living left
untended by the dead.

A House in Ruins~
Intricate designs have been scrawled upon the walls of this house in what
seems to be a mixture of ash and blood.  The designs suggest profound
blasphemy...  A proclamation of the dark joys and awful revels that occured
here.  Great care has been taken in this house to contrast the plesantries
of life as it was with the stark and unrelenting horrors that occured here. 
The agonies wrought upon the inhabitants of this house were brutal and
calculated, as though the perpetartors of these predations were attempting
to create a work of art enshrining the heights of horrific delights.

What was once a pleasantly appointed home has been rendered into a carnal
mockery of love and affection.  All furniture has been removed from this
removed from this place, save for a lone `oplaque `lhanging upon the wall In
the center of the room are two `ocorpses `lthat lie intertwined with each
other.  The room smells sickly sweet, as though incense was burned in honor
of such special torture.

corpse~
The only thing on these two corpses that remains fully intact is their
hair, matted with blood.  They sit opposite each other, legs entwined in a
lover's posture, exposed sinew and cartilage glistening.  Their hands
clasped in a sticky adoration, bound together with ropes of thorn and
bramble.  Their faces seem leaning into kiss, but their lidless eyes stare
into each other with looks of consummate horror and their lipless mouths
seem twisted into an eternal scream of perfect torment.  On the left hand of
each corpse is a golden wedding ring, the color standing out brightly
against the dark of the muscle where the skin used to be.
