`aA dusty old room``~
`eCobwebs and dust line the walls and objects in this room, making it
seem as though not to have been used for a while.  `eGlancing around, you
see books and pews, everything of a dark color.  Darkness seems to seep into
your mind as you wander through, eyeing everything.  `eLarge, unused candles
sit on every surface, and you wonder why they were never used.  `eLeaving
foot prints in the dust, you wander, making sure to take everything in. 
`eReading the titles of the books on the bookselves, you notice an eerie
mention of the words dark, or darkness over and over.  `eSlinking about, you
notice, for the first time, a mysterious statue in the middle of the room. 
How could you not have seen it before?  `eStaring at the beautiful woman
before you, you wonder who she is, and why she's here, in this small room. 
`eNoticing the tiny moon etched on her left shoulder, you begin to feel you
self slip away, almost to another dimension, a dimension of darkness....

`eStanding, suddenly in pitch black, your heart races.  The only light
you see, is coming from the ball held in your quivering hands.  `eYou hear
birds of some sort flying all around, but you are unable to see them, they
do not sound so happy.  `eYou try to figure out why you are here, and where
here is, but you just can't seem to figure it out.  `eLooking all around,
you notice in the sky, a gigantic moon invites you to gaze upon it, yet,
this moon sheds no light to the land.  `eShaking with fear, capturing the
moment, you decide to venture forth, and see what else is here for you.

`eGripping with fear, you slowly travel along the plains, swiftly taking
each step.  `eAll of your senses are well aware of the noises and movements
coming around you, as your heart stops every time you hear one.  `eKnots in
your stomache form more and more as you begin to wander on this unknown
journey.  `eYou begin to question your decision to wander about here as you
venture forth.

`eWandering around the fear begins to penetrate your mind.  Your mind
whirls as howls and loud, frightening squawks fill your ears.  The dark
seems to get darker and darker as you travel further on, but the moon gets
larger.  You shiver from the cold suddenly freezing your body and the large
amount of fear flowing through you.  You desperately wonder what this place
is, and how you got here, if it's real, or even if you are real.  Taking in
a deep breath, you continue along your way....

horrible here, and now, you know this isn't good.  `eYou try and hold your
breath, but really, is that the smartest thing you can do?  `eInstead, you
cover your mouth.  Then, you hear it.  The very first grunt you've heard of
this density.  `eIt sounds like an enlarged elephant it's so loud!  The
grunting goes on over and over.  `eIs this seriously what it seems?  You
don't quite know yet.  So, you travel, into the dark...

inhabited by orc familys.  `eEverything reeks of sidhe and rat and all sorts
of other discusting cooked things.  `eVery little light shines through out
the inhabitance, and you wonder how they see in all this darkness.  `eOrcish
boys seems to follow you around, smelling and trying to touch you.  You bat
them off every now and then and walk around curiously.

`eCrawling in barely clinging to life from the attacks, you suddenly
realize the orc's are not seeming quite so hostile here.  `eAs a matter of
fact, you think they may even be....  Smiling....  `eDancing around they eat
of fresh sidhe hungrily and make this noise, you think it's them singing,
but you'll never really know.

`eWandering about the festivities, the foul stench of grilled sidhe fills
your nose.  `eOrc's bump into you as the move around is their supposed
dance.  `eGroans and moans escape their mouths in a pattern of a song. 
`eYou lean over to grab a sidhe finger, just out of curiosity, and an orc
whaps you quickly.  `eYou see your place, and sit back and watch.

happenings.  `eOrc's fly out of every which way, being as happy as, well, as
an orc can be.  `eSmall children run around hurting eachother and adults
throw whatever they can find into the cauldron.  `eThe discusting stench
fills your nose as you watch the orcs tear into the most discusting food
you've ever seen.

exit.  `eNothing but blackness lies ahead, as far as you can see.  `eThis
nightmare is yet to end, and you have no idea when it will.  `eYou can
already hear the flapping of crows coming again.  `eAnd everything is
suddenly cold.  `eTraveling into the deep dank dark, you sure have time to
think about things...

`aOrc Encampment~
`eYou hear what seems to be chatter coming around as you attempt to slink
through undetected.  Clay huts are scattered through the area, all inhabited
by orc familys.  `eEverything reeks of sidhe and rat and all sorts of other
discusting cooked things.  Very little light shines through the inhabitance,
and you wonder how they see in all this darkness.  `eOrcish boys seen to
follow you around, smelling and trying to touch you.  `eYou bat them off
every now and then, and walk around curiously.

`aAn Orcish meat store~
`eWalking into this store, bloody sidhe bodies hand all over the place. 
`eDwarves lay in heaps in corners, looking almost like they're at peacefull
rest.  `eAsk for any meat you like, surely the butcher will go out of her
way to kill a purely innocent being.  `eBut do not EVER ask the butcher for
Canthi.  If you do, you'll get a package...  For yourself!

`aA brightly lit corner of the Orc Encampment``~
`eEntering this lighted area you have come to you see a wagon.  `eIt's
kind of scrappy and dirty, and there is a funny smell coming from it. 
`eSomeone loud and obnoxious seems to be sitting in there, and every time
they move, the entire wagon shakes.  `eThe driver winks at you, and mutters
'Buy something, will ya?  '.  Apparently this is a shop of sorts...  `eYou
decide to go in and see what's up for grabs.

nausea.  The smell of flesh and screams of people creep into your very soul.

`aInside the Merchant's Wagon``~
`eEntering this wagon, all sorts gross things lie all around, you only
hope they aren't for sale.  BigMouth, ever so appropriately yells to you as
you eye his personal belongings, you know, all the gross things.  `eThen,
even more loudly invites you to make a purchase.  For some strange reason,
you're a little scared to look at the store inventory..  Good luck!

something in the eastern wall.  What seems to be a hole, dug by a bone...

`cEntering this cottage, you see that it's smaller than it looks from the
outside.  `cHalf's of things lie all around, their gears fumbling about. 
`cBig boxes of the insides of machines labeled 'Guts' lay in the corners. 
`cThere's a potted plant in every dusty window, which is growing nicely, for
the shape of this place.  `cWhat little wild life there is wanders freely in
here, amoungt the dust and mess.

`eWandering around the fear begins to penetrate your mind.  Your mind
whirls as howls and loud, frightening squawks fill your ears.  The dark
seems to get darker and darker as you travel further on, but the moon gets
larger.  You shiver from the cold suddenly freezing your body and the large
amount of fear flowing through you.  You desperately wonder what this place
is, and how you got here, if it's real, or even if you are real.  Taking in
a deep breath, you continue along your way....``

`eWandering around the fear begins to penetrate your mind.  Your mind
whirls as howls and loud, frightening squawks fill your ears.  The dark
seems to get darker and darker as you travel further on, but the moon gets
larger.  You shiver from the cold suddenly freezing your body and the large
amount of fear flowing through you.  You desperately wonder what this place
is, and how you got here, if it's real, or even if you are real.  Taking in
a deep breath, you continue along your way....

`eWandering around the fear begins to penetrate your mind.  Your mind
whirls as howls and loud, frightening squawks fill your ears.  The dark
seems to get darker and darker as you travel further on, but the moon gets
larger.  You shiver from the cold suddenly freezing your body and the large
amount of fear flowing through you.  You desperately wonder what this place
is, and how you got here, if it's real, or even if you are real.  Taking in
a deep breath, you continue along your way....
