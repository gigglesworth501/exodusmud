Drunkeness is described by these people in terms of 'rabbits'- the larger
the number the more intoxicated the individual.  20 rabbits might indicate a
state of light tipsyness.  This debauched man has clearly reached the top of
the scale : 400 rabbits.  He blinks at you with a confused look, and the
smell of pulque about him is very strong.

`oA Knight of the `mEagle `oOrder looks down at you, proudly.``

Settling his cloak more comfortably across his shoulders, the Eagle
Knight looks at you disdainfully, while fingering a wickedly curved blade. 
His feathered headdress shakes slightly as he moves, like a warning display.
As are most other Knights here, he is among the best and most worthy of his
people.  The Eagle warriors are proud, yes, but they have a very good reason
to be.

the Sun blue bloods, the higher ranking warriors, and of course, the priests
that essentially rule the city.  He's probably kinder to his dog than to his

different than a young human woman, save for the soft `bglow`o that surrounds her
and the fact that she is not standing, but rather floating just above the
ground.  She is very fair of skin with long `kgolden hair`o that drifts with the
breeze much like the flickering `if`kl`ia`km`ie`o of a candle.  When she speaks, her voice
is soft and soothing and her presence warms the passing breeze.  The thought
of attacking this gentle and benevolent being is simply not a possibility.``

The Continuum general~
`oThe old and bald General of the Continuum army squints at you from atop his chest.``
~
`hA withered old man sits on a check by a foldable table littered with
white and black pawns that he moves around with a `hwooden spade as
messangers run into the tend and reports in strained whispers.  He is clad
in white silks and his bald head `his encircled by a plumed helmet that
looks very out of place on its frail bearer.  ``

bank teller man tobias~
Tobias the CoS teller~
A neatly dressed man stands behind the counter waiting to help you.
~
A slim, dark-haired man of indeterminate age, Tobias is a CoS
fixture.  He dresses neatly but conservatively, in the manner of most
bankers.  Although the fabric of his garment is a fine, skillful weaving,
the chaste cut of it and his manner make it clear that he is all business. 
The cut of his hair hides the tips of his ears, but his face is too round to
be elven, and too angular to be human.

A tranquil inlet~
Lapping blue water moistens plant and soil alike in this small channel
of water that seems to lie dormant even as the water moves almost silently
through the inlet.  As you scan downwards, you see a variety of tiny fish
and animal life enjoying the soothing wash of still salt water over them.

Before the Bridge~
The trees part as you step forth, revealing a wide river with a large
island city.  A wide, brightly painted, stone platform lies before you,
spanning the river.  Down at the end of the platform figures move, made tiny
by the distance.  Beyond the platform tall pyramids dominate the island. 
White smoke rises from somewhere in the city, and the strange, disquieting
smell of charred flesh drifts over to you.

A Small Clearing in the Jungle~
Stepping through a gap in the dense greenery, you reach a small sunlit
clearing.  A large insect buzzes past your head, and a bright bird darts
after it.  To the north you hear a faint sound, rising and falling, perhaps
the sound of someone's voice.

The Flowering Tree~
A beautiful flowering tree stands here filling the air with a heavenly
scent.  Its smooth grey trunk rises up to spreading branches where bright,
red, trumpet-shaped flowers hang down between deep green leaves.  Something
bright moves in and out of sight, up in the foliage.

movement all around you, as wild creatures scurry to get out of your way.

`cThe`j E`cm`je`cr`ja`cl`jd`c Forest``~
Looking up into the forest canopy as the sun shines down through the
leaves, one is assailed with a multitude of shades of green.  The thick
foliage surrounding you seems barren of life although in fact it shelters
thousands of harmless and not-so-harmless creatures.

at you through the leaves?  ``

Stone Platform over the River~
You step onto a wide stone platform bridging the river.  Low walls on
either side are carved with great skill and detail.  Looking closer you see
brightly painted green serpent-forms undulating along the walls' length. 
Their obsidan eyes glitter, seeming almost alive.  Surrounding the carven
serpents is a pale mosiaic of seashells.  A bright motion captures your
attention: down toward the city guards are patrolling, their featherd
headresses more colorful than even the surrounding jungle.

of the river.  The water is brown and opaque, but you see glints of
darting `osilver`g forms as you stare into the river's depths.``

`cGreen tree branches`g arch over the river here, and gnarly roots extend
out into the water catching passing debris.  Something curved and white
catches your eye from among the massed twigs and dead leaves.  Leaning
closer you feel a shudder run through you as you recongnize it to be a
`bhuman's hip bone``.

the river's floor.``

the island and the bank.  Along the northern shore a clump of green river
reeds sways and rustles in the breeze.  To the west, thick tall reeds clog
the river, making it impassible.

the river parts around an island city, its stone pyramids taller than even
the towering jungle canopy.

At the Bottom of the River~
Wan light feebly shines through the muddy depths, barely providing enough
illumination to see by.  A dim shape, too sharp edged to be natural, sticks
out from the soft mud of the river's bottom.  As you move in for a closer
look, small fish dart away.  You see a stone box, with a top of inlaid gold
and turquoise.  The symbol of a rising sun becomes clear when you wipe the
mud away.

the verdant foliage blocks your view, but you hear wild calls all around,
and sense movement in the branches.  Something lives out there.  West stands
a small `npool of water `cwhich leads off into a small river to the
north-west.  ``

Jewelled Bird Street and Feathered Serpent Street~
This corner of the town is less busy than most.  Most of the pedestrians
are black-robed priests, walking with stately stride to their duties.  A few
warriors have donned odd outfits and head northward, towards a strange H
shaped building.  Westward, Feathered Serpent Street continues, running
between the market and the Sun Plaza.  South, Jewelled Bird street extends,
running past the Moon Temple.

Jewelled Bird Street~
A muffled, erratic thumping sound comes from the building to the east. 
The symbols on the door that way show that this is where the ball game is
played.  The noblest warriors are picked for the teams, and the winners are
sacrificed to the gods in the most honorable method possble, thus ensuring
they will be turned into holy eagles in the afterlife.  To the north there
is access to the river, and south the city road leads away.

Feathered Serpent Street~
To the south, a narrow avenue leads into the marketplace.  Mingling with
the smells of fresh tortillas and pulque comes a disquieting scent from the
northwest.  From there white incense smoke drifts down off of the `kSun
`oTemple`l.  Behind it, lies the subtle, deadly smell of fresh blood.  East
and west `bFeathered Serpent Street`l continues.  ``

Feathered Serpent Street~
The stone pavers are well worn in this busy area of the city.  North
the wide `oPlaza of the `kSun`l opens, surrounded with fine houses for the
priests.  South of here the busy market place bustles; the entrance to the
market is to the east.  West the neighborhood grows affluent, homes growing
larger and more opulent where clan leaders and noblemen live.``

Feathered Serpent Street and Eveningstar Road~
Eveningstar road begins here, heading to the south.  Along its well worn
stones many knights and clan leaders march, gathering somewhere to the
south.  East the road is very busy with people either shopping or going to
the Sun Temple.  West is a quiet, affluent neigborhood.

Eveningstar Road~
The houses here are very fine, larger and better made than any other in
the city.  A fiesta is going on nearby, evidenced by the vibration of low
wooden drums and the shrill squeal of reed pipes.  The sharp smell of pepper
sauce wafts forth from the celebration.  Homes are north and west, and the
road leads away south.

Eveningstar Road~
A proud merchant sweeps past, with a long line of heavily burdened
servants trailing after him.  They head east, into the market.  Eveningstar
road continues north and south.  The west side of the road is entirely
occupied by the King's Palace.  Its entrance lies to the south.

Eveningstar Road~
Directly west lies the entrance to the King's Palace.  Priests, warriors,
and clan leaders swarm in and out, coming or going as the king commands. 
The Palace is by far the nicest, largest home in the city, but it comes
nowhere near to the glory of the two temples in the north and east of the
city.  Eveningstar road continues north and south.

The Stone Marker~
On the edge of the path here, a tall, stone statue guards the way.  Its
mouth is agape and its sharpened, stone teeth are ready to rip to shreds any
enemies of the mysterious guardians of this jungle.  A symbol of the sun has
been carved into its belly.

`cThe`j E`cm`je`cr`ja`cl`jd`c Forest``~
Looking up into the forest canopy as the sun shines down through the
leaves, one is assailed with a multitude of shades of green.  The thick
foliage surrounding you seems barren of life although in fact it shelters
thousands of harmless and not-so-harmless creatures.

Deepest Jungle~
The thick, dense foliage can not be pierced by your gaze.  Tall trees
tower overhead, veling the bright, hot sun and creating a kaleidoscope of
greens upon the jungle floor.  A rustle in the nearby underbrush instantly
sets you on your guard.

Path of the Jaguar~
The mud path in this clearing leads from the east into the dense,
overhanging jungle in the south.  Here, and off into the distance eastward
and southward, large, round, white marker stones rest on the edge of the
path.  An image of the fierce and cunning jaguar god has been carved into
the granite stone here.  Just off the path here to the north, a squat stone
building has been erected to act as a sentry-post on this well-worn path.

A Path into the Maize~
It is said that a man who walks alone into one of these cornfields takes
his life into his hands.  Perhaps you should turn around and leave before you
lose your way.  The maize here grows 12 feet tall.  Rich green leaves arch
away from each closely-spaced plant, completely blocking your view.

A Clearer View through the Maize~
You climb up a small hillock which rises slightly above the surounding
maize, allowing you to gain some view of your position.  It seems you are
right in the middle of the field- rows of `jgreen`c stretch away equally in
all directions.  To the `dnortheast`c you see a clear path leading to the
Moon Temple, and to the `dsouthwest`c a path leads to the streets of the
city.  If you walk too far, you're likely to get turned around, and lose all
sense of direction.  ``

Path Through the Market Plaza~
The marketplace is a large area of polished pavement, bordered by shady
arcades, offering shelter to merchants and shoppers alike.  Each quarter of
the marketplace offers a different type of item.  East of here you see
mostly decorative things, and to the west more practical items, like tools
and weapons are offered for sale.

man staggers by, laden with heavy packages while his chattering daughters
follow behind.
  North is some sort of interesection.  The path here allows no direct access
to the merchants.

Center of the Market~
You hear the buzz of voices rise and fall, as all around you people
engage in quiet but intense bargaining.  To the northeast, food and
drink is sold.  To the southeast you may buy decorative items. 
Southwest are tools and weapons.  The shipping canal runs through the
northwest quadrant, making it the perfect place to buy a canoe, and that
is also where the slaves are offered for sale.

their heavy burdens.  They've come from the north, where the shipping dock
provides access to the canal that leads to the river.  Most merchandise is
delivered that way.  West is Eveningstar road and the King's Palace.

brightest `jc`ko`ll`mo`nr`is `lare offered for sale here.  Brushes are also
offered for sale, along with paper, should you wish your work to be

With deceptive ease, the tortilla woman grabs a small blob of `kyellow`l
dough from her pot, and swiftly pats into a thin round about two feet wide. 
She tosses this onto a fire-heated stone slab, flipping it over a moment
later, and hands it to a waiting customer.  The tortilla maker's little girl
tries to imitate her mother, but merely winds up with `kyellow`l goop all
over her hands.  ``

Some of the chattels wear wooden collars.  The collars and their hopeless
expressions mark some slaves as prisoners of war or crime.  Another group of
slaves is dirty and emaciated, and they look to you with hopeful eyes.  These
are men who have encounterd misfortune, and are selling themselves to obtain
food and shelter.

`aThe sound of your own footsteps is the only sound heard in this chamber
`aof the`d earth`a goddess.  The tiles of the ancient, stone floor are covered
`awith carvings of spiders,`c snakes`a, and flying creatures.  Between two
`alarge,`h granite`a pillars rests a massive altar made from the largest piece of
`damber`a you have ever seen.  The rich,`d orange-brown`a altar`k glows`a with some
`akind of inner radiance, as does the`d amber`a eyes of the beautiful stone statue
`astanding behind it.  The tall statue of the Goddess rests on a three-tiered
`apedestal.  Smaller graven images stand on either side of her:  one of a 
`asnarling`d j`ba`dg`bu`da`br`a and one of an`o eagle`a with a`c snake`a in its talons.  The
`areflections of the city's prized`o eternal`k f`il`ka`im`ke`a dance in her`d amber`a eyes,
`aproducing an eerie effect.  You suddenly gaze up in alarm and awe at the
`aGoddess with the`c wreath`a of`c laurels`a on her head, as you realize that the
`asticky substance draining from the`d altar-top`a and dripping from the obsidian
`adirks in the statue's unmoving, stone hands, is the`b lifeblood`a of some
`aunfortunate creature.  Turning away and turning back again, you could almost

`iYour footsteps echo across the smooth, polished floor of the still, Inner
Sanctum.  A sense of power can be felt here.  The walls here also have markings
on them, much like the other walls within the temple.
 
`hThe etchings upon the smooth, glassy walls describe your last task:
 
"`gBrave one, you have proven your agility in the first task, your intelligence
in the second task and your bravery in the third task.  In order to be worthy
of the`k Sun God`g it is also necessary to be wise.  The three hallways
which branch off of this room lead to either success or failure.
The carvings on their walls are in honor of their deities:  `oThe M`ho`oo`hn
`oG`ho`od`hd`oe`hs`os`g, the`k Sun God`g and the`i Fire Dancer`g, one of which is always truthful,
one is always deceptive and one who is alternately truthful and deceptive but
in which order is unknown.  Examine the carvings on the walls in each hall
before making your choice if you are to succeed.  Determine which door is the
one that will lead to success.  Choose wisely.`h"``

`dThe Slaves' Room``~
Small and plain, this room is where the slaves sleep and spend their rare
times off.  Woven mats and a few blankets are the the most prominent items,
among a few shabby belongings scattered about.  A single oil lamp hangs from
the ceiling, augmenting with its flickering glow the meagre daylight from the
window slit.

construction: the heavy thump of mallets and the coarse sound of grinding
stones are a familiar part of this section of town.

Oil-soaked torches illumine this this windowless foyer.  The smooth
plastered walls have been completely covered with painted scenes.  Most of
the colorful murals show the King in battle- defeating all the surrounding
tribes.  A few show the gods favoring the City of the Sun or the various
clan leaders dressed for war.

`jThe `fKing's Garden`j is so large that an arrow shot from one side would
not reach the opposite wall.  Manicured wilderness mimics the jungle, gravel
paths offering ease of travel.  Tame parrots chatter and pet monkeys swing
down to play.  Stone archways with carven symbols above are barely visible,
afar off, set into all four of the garden walls.  West, a `er`fi`bs`li`nn`og `ksun`j
indicates the residence of the king.  South a `if`me`oa`mt`ih`me`or`me`id `ms`oe`mr`ip`me`on`mt`j signifies
priests.  An `deagle`j to the north stands for warriors.  East a `bbasket`j shows
the way out.

Weapons and armor and supplies of all sorts are stored here- offerings of
all the clan leaders to the king.  Mostly the arms are used to attack
surrounding villages, to capture sacrificial victims.  However, if some
other power should arise and mount an assault, with all this the king would
be amply prepared.

Not even thin woven mats soften the stone floor of the priests' wing. 
These men are here to show their dedication to serving the gods, in pain and
blood and self-sacrifice.  Most have ritually mutilated themselves in
variously hideous ways.  A few of the weaker ones have fallen asleep on the
stones, earning the scorn of the rest.

wears a bright mask with the likeness of an animal upon it, along with
brilliant embroidered cotton armor and colorful feathers.

removed all ornament before entering, so as to not outshine the simple garb
worn by their War Chief who sits upon the throne.

The lord of all was the Smoking Mirror, the Chief of the Gods.  The men

verdant green around you.  The air is completely still.  A fine mist falls;
the sound of water tapping on wide leaves sends a low hiss through the
jungle.  The vibrant scents of living, growing things fill you with energy. 
With every step leaves slap wetly against you.  The earth is soft and
springy, the ground cover bouncing back at every step.  The pungent smell of
jaguar lingers; faint- just detectable.

`cUp in the Giant Tree``~
`jThe jungle canopy is home to an entire ecosytem of its own.  Plants and
animals live up here among the trees, never leaving to travel on the ground.
In this tree the vine you climbed to reach here has expanded out over the
branches, forming a web that catches the falling debris from higher leaves. 
The debris has decayed into a rich soil where rare herbs flourish, up closer
to the sunlight.  ``

reaches up and removes the hood from your head.  Looking down, you see the

you climb up into the canopy, where a troupe of monkeys scatters in alarm.

Up in the Jungle Canopy~
Monkeys hoot and screech in alarm at your intrusion.  You climb across
wide, leafy branches clinging to vines and thick twigs to keep from falling.
A quick downward glance shows the jungle floor over 100 feet below.  Above,
huge deep green leaves block most of the sky, but here and there a spot of
blue is visible.  This high up there is an erratic breeze, causing your
precarious perch to sway.

tunnels.  After an exhausting journey you emerge into the `cJungle`b. 
Continuing onward, you are led along a pathway that becomes ever more clear.
The Adepts stop suddenly, bow to you, and fade away into the surrounding
trees.  As you watch them leave, a voice whispers, "`iGo east.  `b"``

jungle plateau.  Few people are around- most must be out working in the
everlasting quest to find sustenance.  Now would be the perfect opportunity
to search for the chest which holds the Ring of the War Chief.  The key you
took from the monkey will unlock it.  When you have the ring return here.

decoration.  The back wall is covered with grinning human skulls,
ornamented with finely made glass eyes and obsidian blades for noses.  A
stone vessel in the shape of an eagle is lined with some flaking brown
material.  A square block of stone serves as an altar.  Presently a
small alabaster bowl of smoking incense sits upon it.``

`gAn eerie blue-white light fills this tiny stone chamber, its source
unseen.  It is cool in here, deep inside the `oMoon Temple`g.  The walls are
bare, but fine etchings of ancient design- holy symbols- have been carved
into the stone.  The perimeter of the room is marked with `cfresh `jjungle
`iblooms`g, bright in the mysterious light, lending a sweet scent to the
air.  The door behind you swings shut and blends away into the stone wall. 
`gThe etchings in the wall continue the story told in the hallway...
 
`iWe now live in the age of the fifth sun, called Four Earthquakes, for it has
been foretold that earthquakes shall destroy our world soon.  Until then we
seek to postpone that day, by serving well the lord of this age - the `kSun
God`i.  ``

Plaza of the`o M`ho`oo`hn`o T`he`om`hp`ol`he``~
The tall stone walls of this momument to the moon god gleam brightly by
day and by the light of the moon as well.  A wide courtyard filled with
mystical, power symbols carved into the pavement is laid out before the
large, obsidian doors set into the foreboding eastern walls.  What mysteries
are contained behind them?  To the west, Jewelled Bird Street stretches from
north to south.

`fThe Underground Prisons``~
`fYou have been unceremoniously dumped in a cold damp cave.  Dark tunnels
lead away in all directions.  Sounds of other prisoners echo hollowly
through the stone passages - moans and sighs and weeping.  Only those too
weak or useles to be sold as slaves or offered as sacrifices are abandoned
here, perhaps to be retrieved later if some task low enough for them comes
to hand before they die.  ``

`bLost in the tunnels of despair``~
`d Crawling through a slick stone tunnel, your knees ache and the rotting
smell gags you.  Bones and other less decomposed human remains are the most
common objects you run across and must crawl over.  Rats scatter at your
touch.  More tunnels lead off into all directions, none of them showing any
hope of light or escape.  ``

River's End~
The warm water of the river gently flows here.  What appears to be a
rotting log slowly floating along the current suddenly turns into a
crocodile as it slowly heaves itself up the heavily foliated banks.  The
gentle current flows from the south to the east here.  A tall, stone pyramid
can be seen peeking over the treetops in the distance.

Turn in the River~
The slow, calm waters of the Great River meander from the west to the

birds can be heard as they lift off in flight from a nearby tree.

River near the Slums~
A foul stench rises from the water here.  To the north you see its cause:
a stone channel empties all the city's sewage into the river water.  Poor
mud hovels crowd together near the outlet.  Clearly, this edge of the city
is the worst place to live.  To the east the river is choked with mud and a
thick mat of jungle debris, making further travel that way impossible.

Chambers of the Captains~
A stone slab serves as the table in the center of this medium sized room.
Cured hides with painted maps on them and various shields hang on the walls
of the chamber.  An image of a golden sun rising has been painted on the
eastern wall.  The experienced captains of the orders of Ocelot and Eagle
knights plan out their battle strategies here, confer with one another
regarding the state of the knights and interview new warriors here for the
knighthood.

Meeting Chambers of the`m Eagle`k and`o Ocelot`k Knights``~
This spacious stone room is where the Orders of the`m Eagle`l and`k
Ocelot`l Knights meet when they discuss enemies to the city, ways to make
the city a more peaceful place and when they are to be given new orders by
the captains of their orders.  On the eastern wall a large image of an eagle
with bloody talons has been painted with vivid colors.  On the opposite
facade, a picture of a fierce ocelot baring its teeth has been painted as
well.  In the center of the room are located varioius benches on which the
knights sit when meeting.  To the south behind a woven mat hanging over the
doorway, is the chamber of the knights' captains.  Easterly the exit leads
onto Feathered Serpent Street.

`nA pool of clear water``~
`gThe musical trilling of treefrogs in song surrounds you as you float
across the placid water.  Water drips from overhanging branches, causing the
flawless reflections of sky to waver and break apart.  To the east a gap
between two massive tress offers a good landing.  North the river winds
away.  ``

`lA gently flowing jungle river``~
`gA few dark, rounded rocks punctuate the water's surface.  The river
ripples around them without slowing a bit as it drains southward to a small
round pool.  Following a wide bend, the river curves away to the west.  ``

`lA river in through the jungle``~
`gThe river takes a bend here, leading north and east.  A huge dead tree
has fallen into the water, forcing you to maneuver carefully around it.  A
pair of large, bright blue parrots flies overhead, swooping down into the
jungle.  A resounding squawk echoes as one of them lands.  ``

suspiciously the whole time.  ``

`hFor a general, this tent is truly spartan, some folding chars sit in a
