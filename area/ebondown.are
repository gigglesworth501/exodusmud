that the dirt is caked upon his skin in sheets, much like the bark of a

himself out of the feces that he lays in.  In all, he is a pathetic sight,
and you long to both help him, and leave his disgusting presence.

Jericka master assassin~
`aJericka, the master assassin``~
`aThe master assassin rests comfortably in her chair.``
~
`aJericka is a tall woman, standing nearly six feet, though she can appear much
shorter when the situation calls for it.  She is thinly built, but with a lean
muscularity.  Her black hair falls to her shoulders, framing her dark face.
With high cheekbones and angular facial features, she looks as though she could
have been carved from ebony.  Her expression is generally relaxed and the calm
in her eyes gives away nothing of her profession.``

A slender dirt road~
`dMounds of flattened red soil are encroached by thick tufts of clover
and grass, creating a traversable, if narrow path through the area here. 
West- ward, the sounds of industry and civilization fill the air, and to
your east you can see a continuation of the road, leading to a flat plateau
of rock.  ``

At the piers of Ebon Downs~
You stand among the long, majestic piers of Ebon Downs.  Ships ranging
from thin, seafolk cruisers, to fat and bulky merchant river traders are
docked here, ready to unload their cargo.  Men and women alike hustle to and
fro here, trying to get their business done for the day.  The main road
leading into Ebon Downs proper heads off to the north here.

The Piers of Ebon Downs~
As you walk steadily towards the center of Ebon Downs, the population
increases steadily, and you are jostled about a few times by rude locals. 
The air here smells of stale fish, and the sound of hoarse yelling and wood
banging on wood fills the air.  The main road winds its way between numerous
encampments that have sprung up around the trading of the piers.

Bridge Street~
You now stand on the main street that winds its way through the heart of
Ebon Downs.  Small homes and businesses line the street to either side,
busy with the influx of the trading vessels.  Just to the north of here, you
can see what appears to be the central circle of the town, dominated by a
wide brass fountain.  The fountain is shaped into the form of a massive
leaping fish, water spewing from both its mouth and gills.

Ebon Downs Circle~
This is the center of the entire town of Ebon Downs.  The circle offers
roads that lead off in all four cardinal directions, and is dominated by a
massive brass fountain that stands in the center of the circle.  The
fountain is shaped in the form of a leaping fish, water spewing from its
mouth and gills.  Truthfully, it is not a very pretty statue, but you
suppose the locals find some sort of value in it.

Bridge Street~
You walk along the main 'avenue', if you would call it that, of Ebon
Downs.  In reality, it is not much more than a hard-packed dirt road that
has had ruts worn in it by too many overloaded ox carts.  The road winds its
way through a series of shops and homes, sturdy, but not very affluent
looking.

Bridge Street~
The main road of Ebon Downs continues to the north and south here,
making its way through a smattering of buildings that could probably be used
for either residential use or commerce.  The buildings are made of a think
looking wood, and looks very suited to the port type town that Ebon Downs
has become to be known as.

High Street~
You are on a slightly elevated plot of dirt that serves as a road that
dissects Ebon Downs in half.  For the most part, the buildings that line
the hard packed dirt are fairly old, and look as if they could use some
renovation.  High Street comes back to a normal elevation a short ways off
to the west, where you can see the famous leaping fish fountain of
Ebon Downs.

the center of town, a circle dominated by a massive brass fountain, shaped
to resemble a leaping fish.  As for the buildings along the street itself,
they are not immense in size, but they look fair enough for a village of
this size.

Ilangollen Street~
You have arrived at the intersection between Ilangollen and Bridge Streets.
Ilangollen Street has been named after the river that plies Ebon Downs's
trade, although you can see no particular reason why it has been thusly
called.  It seems like any other road in the town, hard packed dirt, and if
you are lucky, a think sprinkling of gravel on top.  Ilangollen Street runs to
the east and west here, where you can see more buildings and shops lining
the street.

An alleyway in Ebon Downs~
The alleyway continues onwards here, cutting through a number of
buildings and bathing you in their shadows.  Trash litters the street, and
the stench of rotting food items assails your nose.  Off to the west here,
you can see a collection of boxes that have been set up.  You can't make out
what they are exactly in the darkness, but you can see Bridge Street off
to the east.

An alleyway in Ebon Downs~
You stand at the end of the darkened alleyway.  To the north and east
stand the back of buildings, the back doors barred and sealed shut long ago.
Off to the west, you can see what all the boxes and wooden beams have been
used to construct.  It is a literal encampment of the homeless, a sullied
and bedraggled bunch of folk that make you feel both sick and sad at the
same time.  They sit under their makeshift shelters and you walk by,
pretending that they don't exist.

Shantyville~
Here among the broken down boxes and wooden planks that try to support
the sagging structures, you can't but help find the compassionate side in
you.  There are only so many children's pouting eyes that you can look into
before you cave in, and decide to give them a few coins.

Shantyville~
The smell here is not a pleasant one to say the least.  It is a toxic
mixture of sweat, month old dirt, and blood and urine that seeps into your
nose and leaves a bad taste in your mouth.  Nevertheless, you can't help but
feel pity and compassion for the huddled creatures who are forced to dwell
here, and you think that maybe it wouldn't be a stretch to give them a few
coins.

Ilangollen Street runs off the east here, taking a bend to the north and
disappearing shortly out of view.  The buildings lining the street here are
much like any other you have encountered in Andor, and made of the same
sturdy construction.  A short ways off to the west, you can make out where
Ilangollen Street intersects with the main road, Bridge Street.

off, you can see where it intersects with yet another dirt road.  Small
houses predominantly line this street, hugging each other wall to wall in an
effort to steal a little bit extra space.

Ilangollen Street~
Ilangollen Street runs off to the east and west here, bounded by a number
of small homes that are connected wall to wall.  The homes are mostly one
story in construction, cheap places that look as if they have been mass
produced.  In any case, the flow of traffic on the road is light, and you
can go either way down the street.

Taranel and Ilangollen~
You have arrived at the intersection of Taranel and Ilangollen.  The
intersection is not particularly busy, no more so than any other
intersection you have seen here.  Besides a few shops that sell food and
drink, the corner is bounded by homes and what appear to be office buildings
of some type.  The air here smells a bit like stale fish, and as you look
off to the west and the Ilangollen River, you can guess why.

Taranel Road~
Taranel Road runs to the north and south here, a shady looking district
that seems to house every overbearing and threatening looking soul in the
entire town.  A short distance off to the north, the hard packed dirt road
intersects with Ilangollen Street, and off to mthe south, slopes slightly
downward to meet the intersection with the Low Road.

An alleyway in Ebon Downs~
A small alleyway cuts in between a pair of buildings here on the main
road of Ebon Downs.  Although the surrounding buildings are not very tall
at all, they seem to cast shadows across the alleyway, even during the peak
hours of the day.  Shady characters creep about around each corner here, and
you think that maybe you are wandering into a bad part of town.

The Salty Pork Rind~
The dimness of this tavern is such that it hurts your eyes.  The paradox
of that statement is lost on you as you are engulfed in the embrace of a
group of swarthy men reeking of alcohol and smoke.  The room itself is large
enough to house a good twenty round tables, and a long bar on the west end
of the chamber.  The entire atmosphere is fairly seedy, and you definitely
think you would not recommend this bar to any newbie!

The River Bed and Breakfast~
This room is brightly lit by enclosed lanterns that hang on either side
of the chamber.  They frame a long receptionist's desk along the east wall,
where a man stands, taking reservations for rooms in the inn upstairs.  The
walls are plainly decorated with mundane paintings of landscapes, and
trophies of fish caught in the local river.  It isn't the most exciting inn
that you have ever seen, but it definitely is not the worst either.  Behind
the counter, you can see where a ladder leads the way up to the second
floor, and to what you presume are the bedchambers.

A bedroom alcove~
The ladder from downstairs deposits you here in a small, cubical alcove
that is bordered by a door to each of its four sides.  A pair of lanterns
provide the lighting here, and the associated shadows are accompanied by a
smell wafting through the air.  It is quite pleasant actually, and smells of
lavenders blooming in the fall.

A bedroom at The River Bed~
You stand in a small cubicle of a chamber that is barely large enough to
fit the bed and the dresser that exist there.  As you glance around the
unadorned room, you wonder where you can go to the bathroom in this inn.  As
you glance out the tiny window in the north wall, you realize that the
bathroom is a small shack that stands a good fifty feet away from the rear
of the building.

A bedroom at The River Bed~
The room that you have walked into is a tiny cubicle, barely large enough
for human survival.  In fact, besides the bed and the dresser in the room,
you would be lucky if you could even carry your bags into the room.  The
room is dimly lit and smells faintly of lavender and an undercurrent of
sweat.  Maybe that would explain why the innkeepers would want to burn those
scented candles...

A bedroom at The River Bed~
You stand in the doorway of a tiny room, that you can barely fit your
buttocks into.  A bed and a dresser standing adjacent to it are the
furnishings in the room, leaving perhaps enough room to lay down your pack. 
The room smells faintly of sweat, and the bed sheets are littered with the
occassional piece of caked mud.

hangs from a hook in the ceiling.  A bed and a dresser are about the only
things that can fit in this tiny cubicle of a room, it is disgustingly small
and actually smells a bit like breeches that have not been washed in a
month.

The backroom at the Salty Pork Rind~
You stand in the back room of The Salty Pork Rind, and at first glance,
it does not appear any cleaner than the main room.  Ale has been spilled
onto the ground, forming a rather odiferous stench.  Sharp looking knives
have been jammed into the wooden walls here with great force, and by
inference, you assume that this is where some of the men come to play at
knives and darts.

Taranel and Low Intersection~
The Low Road intersects Taranel Road here.  Although the Low Road seems
to be one of the busiest streets in Ebon Downs, this intersection itself
does not seem to direct much traffic.  The banks of the Ilangollen flow to the
south and west here, making you wonder what insane builder would place the
town right along the shores of the waters.  An embankment has been built up
against the river side, but it seems to be a tenuous position nevertheless.

The Low Road~
You stand on a road that seems slightly depressed in comparison to the
main road of Ebon Downs.  Hence, the name Low Road most likely.  In any
case, the hard packed dirt road extends off to the west here, where it meets
another street running north and south.  Most of the buildings lining this
street seem to be businesses, plying their trade.  A short distance off to
the east, you can see the massive fish fountain that seems to almost
characterize Ebon Downs.

On a pier at Ebon Downs~
The pier under your feet seems to creak with every step you take, even
though the wood seems to have been treated in some way.  At the end of this
pier in particular, you can make out the sails of a Sea Folk cutter, its
thin hull floating majestically above the murky waters of the river below. 
There are no railings on the pier, and you wonder what would happen if
someone took the plummet down to the river below.

On a pier at Ebon Downs~
You have reached the end of the pier, at which a Sea Folk cutter is tied.
You can't make out anything inside the darkened vessel that looms to the
north, and the slender Canthi man standing in front of the loading ramp 
does not seem inclined to let you have a closer look.  Nevertheless, the 
sight is a majestic one.  If only you could get a peek inside...

The Ilangollen River~

much time to ponder the subject before you fall into the swirling river. 
Hopefully, you're a good swimmer and things will turn out for the best.

Ramp to a Sea Folk vessel~
You stand on a thin wooden plank that has been placed at an angle to
allow you access to the Sea Folk vessel moored at the pier.  The creaking
wood of the ramp does not seem like it would support your weight, but
nevertheless it does, and you can see where the ramp disappears into the
ship itself.  The waters of the Ilangollen River slosh underneath the ramp
here, lapping up against the hull of the boat in cyclic waves.

A quaint home~
You have walked into a small home, essentially a one room cabin.  It is
quaintly decorated in sublime greens and violets, and for the stauncher
masculine warrior types, it almost makes you feel sick.  Pieces of furniture
have been carefully laid around the room in an effort to maximize space and
minimize the clutter.  Gently brushed portrait plates hang from the walls in
between carefully placed reed bundles, all adding to the down home image.

destination.  Other than the large oak desk, the room is unadorned, and so
drab it makes you want to vomit.

bumping into you in an effort to get your attention.  It's almost
claustrophobic here, and you decide you want to get out of this area as
quickly as possible.

everything seems to be either frilly or puffy.  A number of ladies lounge
about here, waiting to pick up their next job, which might be you from the
looks of things!  An open doorway leads off to the east here, to where, your
naive mind can only wonder.

You stand just inside one of the more reputable inns in Ebon Downs, The
Wayfarer's Rest.  There is nothing visibly special about the inn, except
perhaps the fact that it is nearly spotless.  Tables of various shapes and
sizes are scattered about the room, with accompanying chairs.  A bar has
been established a little bit further to the west here, offering their
supply of home brew.  The atmosphere here is pleasant, and although the
smell of smoke is strong, and the conversation loud, you almost feel at home
here.

to the north and south here.  Judging from the moaning and squeaking going
on behind the screens, you think that it might be a good idea to get out of
here.

the middle of the room.  The sheets on the bed are rumpled, and smell of
sweat, woman, and man.  A soft but garish lantern emanates its pink light
across the length of the otherwise bare room, the owners of this fine
establishment spared no expense it seems.

is a gruesome one and you are inclined to turn around and leave.

Various people stand here, trying to get information, or just looking to buy
a mug of the Wayfarer's rest home brew.  As you peruse the selection written
on a piece of slate behind the bar, you are taken aback at the prices of the
ale here.  Then again you think, money isn't always what it seems here.  Off
to the south and east, you can see where tables and chairs have been set up,
and to the southeast, you can see where a small area has been cleared for
the possibility of a performing gleeman.

made from a deep, uncracked oak.  Off to the east, you can see where a
hopeful and enthusiastic audience has cleared a place for any wandering
gleeman to play.

assume that this is where gleeman perform when the inn has the good fortune
of obtaining one's services.

north, a hallway runs that ends a short ways off in a collection of three
doors.  The hallway itself is adorned with a few, rather boring paintings
that seem to be placed there because there was simply nothing else to
decorate with.  The staircase leads the way down here, back into the smoke
and ruckus of the common room.

to look at the architecture of the rooms, since the doors swing outwards,
two people can't leave their rooms at the same time.

is not a bad deal at all.  The walls have been thoughtfully decorated with
small trinkets from Linden, a banner with the lions of Athanmere for
example.  A small chamberpot sits in the corner of the room, ready to be
filled.

extravagant features.  A chamberpot sits in the corner of the room as well,

An alleyway in Ebon Downs~
You stand in a dark alleyway that extends off to the north here,
enshrouded in darkness and debris.  Shady looking characters pace back and
forth here and lounge against the building walls, in anticipation of a
traveler walking alone.  The air smells of week old rotting meat, and
assails your nostrils with the force of a sledge hammer driving a nail into
your nose.  It is sickening, and you decide you probably don't want to stay
here much longer.

head either east or west.  The alleyway ends a short ways off to the east,
in a pile of rubble and broken wooden beams.  Off to the west, you can see a
worn down looking door, wood grey from water damage and general old age. 
The building to which the door leads is delapidated looking.  You are amazed
that it can stand on its own.

want to get out of.

building is grey and worn, but somehow still looks strong, reinforced by
black steel bars placed across its width.  The windows of the building have
been boarded shut, though you thought you could see eyes watching you
through cracks in the slats.

On a ship of the Canthi Seers~
You stand on the main deck of the boat, at the edge where a ramp leads
down to the pier of Ebon Downs.  The deck seems to be made of a deep
darkened wood, cured and treated so it shines with a peculiar glossy finish.
The main deck continues off to the north, east.  And west, and a thin rope
ladder allows you to climb up into the crow's nest.

On the main deck~
The deck sways slightly under your feet as it adjusts for the swells that
come into Ebon Downs off the Ilangollen River.  However, the grippy texture
of the deck enables you to keep your balance easily.  It is a wonder that
the deck offers such a foothold because at first glance, it appears to be a
slippery sheen of wood/ice.  Ropes and boxes litter the deck, as the Sea
Folk prepare for their next trading port-of-call.

On the main deck~
You stand on the deck of a ship of the Canthi Seers, the fabled Sea
Folk.  It's a wonder that you have made it this far onto the vessel, with
all the mysteries that they keep and all.  The wood of the ship is a deep
brownish black hue, and does not contain the normal grains that you expect
out of wood.  Also, despite its glossy appearance, the deck provides an
almost tacky gripping for your feet to dig in, even among the wet
enbironment of the high seas.

On the main deck~
This is the main deck of the Sea Folk ship.  The wood of the deck seems
to be made of some material you have never seen before, a deep blackish
brown hue that almost does not seem like wood at all.  Although it shines
with a primordal gleam, it offers the solid foothold necessary when sailing
on the high seas.

You stand at the corner of the main deck here.  A space has been cleared
among the numerous lines and boxes on the deck for the ladder that leads up
to the foredeck.  The ladder looks spindly, and you doubt that it could hold
your weight.  As you look over the edge of the boat, you can see the
beautiful bends of the Ilangollen River, as it bends away towards Thesden to
one side, and Promeria to the other.  The sight is an inspiring one, but you
think that if you stand on this rocking boat much longer, you may have to
vomit.

On the main deck~
You stand on the main deck of a Sea Folk trading clipper, a sleek and
well designed boat that is capable of cutting through any height of wave and
water.  The deck itself is made of a brownish black wood that grips your
feet despite the slippery appearance.  At first glance, ropes and various
nets and boxes have been strewn haphazardly across the deck, but on closer
inspection, everything is within easy reach, and filed according to their
functions.

A Hallway in a Sea Folk Vessel~
This is a quaintly set up hallway in the center of the Sea Folk ship,
deep brown wooden panels brightly lit up by softly muted lanterns that glow
along both the walls and from the ceiling.  There are doors to the south
west and east here, presumably to what are the bedding chambers of the crew.
The doors to the east and west require you to walk a bit further down the
hallway though.

the hallway stand both to the west and south here.  The doors themselves are
slightly reinforced with bars of black steel that run across their middles. 
The entire scene makes you feel at home for some reason, a very comfortable
and pleasing ambience.

standing to your east and south.  The doors are reinforced with bands of
black steel riveted across their middles, but the bands do little to lessen
the comfortable atmosphere that is present here.

You stand in the hold of the Sea Folk vessel, a dark and dank chamber
that is dominated by the sheer number of boxes and chests that have been
secured to the walls and the ground here.  Dim, flickering lanterns cast
their shadows across the low ceilinged hold, making you duck and creep in
the slosh of water at your feet.  Small cracks of light seep in through the
rifts of a trap door that sits closed above your head here.

weren't sure if you expected something different, this being a Sea Folk ship
and all, but nevertheless, it is nothin special.  A darkened large room that
is lit by the only occassional lantern carefully hooded on the walls.  It is
quite hard to see down here, and you thought you felt something brush
against your leg.

waterproof!  Shadows play across your vision as the lanterns on the walls
flicker on and off, on and off.  You are somewhat disappointed by the entire
scene, you somehow expected more from the Sea Folk.

hope for the Sea Folk's sake that they are waterproof.  Small lanterns
provide the illumniation for the hold, casting their shadows across the
area, and making the entire ambience rather ghostly.

even less so when you feel something brush up against your leg.

A cabin in a Sea Folk Vessel~
This room is small relative to any normal room in a normal house in a
normal land.  However, when you think of where you stand, in a boat, you
think that this mush be a sumptuous quarter indeed.  The room is large
enough to fit in the swinging hammock in the corner, and a number of metal
foot lockers.  The room itself is contructed from the same demure wood as
was used outside in the hallway.  Light is provided from small balls that
hang from the ceiling, glowing with a soft light.

swings slowly to and fro in one corner of the room, while a small dresser
occupies another corner.  It has been quaintly done, and does not have very
much in the way of furnishings.

through the doorway, the room opens up into a spacious bowl, slightly
depressed at the center, where a full sized bed rests, bolted tightly
against the floor.  All around the walls of the room, paintings and ornate
tapestries hang from golden rods strung across the ceiling.  Other various
pieces of furniture lie around here, everything secured to the ground by
bolts and small clasps.  It is a beautiful room, especially inside a ship as
it is.

Climbing the mast~
You cling tenunously to the rope ladder that wavers in the wind and
swings with your every weight shift.  You wonder about the craziness of the
Canthis and their refusal to stabilize this rope ladder.  You take
comfort only in the fact that it is a shorter fall than it is to climb to
the top.  And a small comfort that is.

you might as well continue, because the crow's nest of the ship is only a
short ways upwards.

into the relatively sheltered confines of the crow's nest.  However, after
you sit here and rest for a moment, you realize that the entire mast is
swaying in the heavy winds blowing from inland.  You start to think that
although the view from here is stunning, it wasn't such a great idea after
all.

you can see that at the very point of the ship, a disc shaped wheel has been
fastened to the railing, presumably the steering mechanism for this ship.

can look almost directly down upon the water.  It gives you the feeling of

fishing.  All sorts of hooks and lines hang from the walls here, and the

looks at you from behind a counter on the east wall, waiting to service you.

it turns, but then again, you never were an electrical engineer.

ground as well as the intermixed droppings of horses.  A number of not so

Ebon Downs is known as a port town, and not for their horses.

people of Ebon Downs, evidently they were not too famous, because you have
never heard of them before.  A hole has been cut in the ceiling and replaced
with glass in this room, allowing sunlight to add to the already brightly
lit room.

only furnishing of the room, covered with a collection of books and maps. 
This is the hideout for the criminal element in town, darkfriends and normal
ruffians alike.  A door off to the east stands slightly ajar, you can see
where it leads off into a darkened hallway beyond the door.

A murder hole~
You stand on top a thick metal grating, through which you can look down
upon the entrance to the house.  In case you are not too perceptive, this
allows you to rain fire and acid, and arrows down upon potential intruders. 
It is dark here, as dark as the hallway below.  The grating has hinges that
open up to the left, and a thin wire ladder that leads back down to the
hallway below.

The Ilangollen River~
You find yourself floating lazily along the Ilangollen River, buoyed by its
rippling white currents, racing through the clean cut banks of the river. 
You find that although you are buoyed above the currents, you are being
soaked through to the skin, and the water is cold!

At the end of a pier~
The pier under your feet seems to creak with every step you take, even
though the wood seems to have been treated in some way.  Close by to the
northeast, the distinctive mast and sails of a Sea Folk cutter can be seen,
with its thin hull floating majestically above the murky waters of the river
inlet below.  There are no railings on the pier, and you wonder what would
happen if someone took the plummet down to the river below.

The pier under your feet seems to creak with every step you take, even
though the wood seems to have been treated in some way.  Close by to the
northwest, the distinctive mast and sails of a Sea Folk cutter can be seen,

inlet below.  There are no railings on the pier, and you wonder what would

The Ilangollen River~
You have reached a bend in the Ilangollen River here, as it curves gently
to the east.  The waters themselves are anything but gentle though, as the
rapids buffet you and toss you about the width of the river.  You can see
the town of Ebon Downs overlooking the river off to the east, you wonder if
anyone in town would be willing to help you out.

The Ilangollen River~
The Ilangollen River runs to the south of the town of Ebon Downs here, its
rapids directing you to the south and downstream.  You are already soaked
through, and you can only think of getting out of these chilly waters as
soon as possible.

On the Outskirts of Ebon Downs~
You come down off the Ebon Downs itself, and can see the town proper
nestled cozily up against the river bend up ahead.  The road you travel on
now is hard packed dirt, and little seems to change as you enter the town. 
The road winds its way east, into the small homes and businesses that have
been erected along the river.  All in all, the town is nothing amazing,
especially in view of the dazzling bridge just to its west.

High Street~
High Street continues both to the east and west here.  Off to the east,
you can see where it merges to become the Eastern Road, on its way to the
fabled city of Promeria.  The High Road has gotten its name because the hard
packed dirt that you stand on seems to have been lumped over time and time
again, and has thus become higher than the surrounding terrain.  The
buildings on either side of High Street look fairly old, and it makes
Ebon Downs look pretty shabby from this perspective.

On the Outskirts of Ebon Downs~
You stand on the outskirts of the town called Ebon Downs, a collection
of small businesses, homes, and most importantly, a port town.  The Eastern
Road winds its way through small homes and the occasional shack on its way
into the city proper.  As you walk towards the city, you notice that the
elevation is getting slightly higher, as the perspective on the surrounding
terrain changes.  In any case, Ebon Downs is just off to the west, as is
the Ilangollen River, so you may as well have a looksee.

Upon the Sunbleached Cliffs~
You find yourself ascending as you travel a path that skirts the
sunbleached cliffs of Ebon Downs.  The rocks that you climb have been
bleached a crystalized white by the unrelentless sun.  The interminable
ocean swells and forths beneath you to the south and the east.

Upon the Sunbleached Cliffs~
You take extra care to monitor your footing as the path you travel is no
longer a real path.  Instead, you find yourself climbing the marbelized
rocks that make up this cliff face, all the while enjoying the beautiful
view that this altitude is affording you.

Upon the Sunbleached Cliffs~
You stand at the pinnacle of these gleaming sunbleached cliffs.  Battered
over time by sun and sea, the surface of these rocks are smooth and
edgeless.  The ocean stretches out before you, an endless wave of cerulean
blue.  Looking down, you see a small cove that you think you might be able
to reach by scaling the cliff face, though you take great precaution for one
false move could send you smashed against the rock face.

Dead Man's Cove~
Clinging to the side of the rock face with all your might, it becomes
evident why locals call this place Dead Man's Cove.  Completely unprotected
from the ocean and weather, this easternmost point of exposed land suffers
the brutality of vicious wind and unrelentless waves.  To the west, you spy
a cave entrance, though you can't tell from here how deep it goes.  You can
also attempt to scale the cliffs above, and see what lays above ground.

`aEntrance to the Assassin's Guild``~
`aAs you walk further onth the darkness of the alley, the sounds of the
city fade away behind you.  It is clear that you have entered a part of the
alley where few citizens dare to tread, as evidenced by the rather abrupt
dropoff in the litter lying around.  The wind howls around you, blowing the
occasional scrap of paper across your feet.  You may retreat back towards
the safety of the town to your south, or continue down this alley as it
turns eastward.  ``

`aAnother curve in the alley``~
`aThe alley takes a turn to the south here, wrapping itself around wall
that lies to the southwest, almost as though the wall was built for the sole
purpose of hiding what is on this side of it.  A simple doorway in the north
wall leads to a room beyond.  The garbage-strewn alley you initially passed
through was clearly nothing more than a ruse, because this part of the alley
is immaculate.  ``

`aA dead end in the alley``~
The alley comes to an end here, most likely because there wassimply no
obvious reason for it to continue.  The only physical exit is to the north,
where the alleyway turns west out of sight.  You are surrounded by walls in
all other directions.  The only noteworthy fixture in this room also happens
to be one of the most remarkable fixtures you have ever seen.  A massive
portal in the shape of a circle, ten feet across takes up the entire south
wall.  Within it is a maelstrom of swirling grey mists.  The portal looks as
though it has been here for quite some time and it looks very stable.

`aShrine of the Master Killer``~
You find yourself in a comfortable room adorned in a simple, yet
respectable fashion.  The obsidian floor has been polished to a mirror
finish and you gaze down into it to see a shadowy reflection of yourself. 
Along the walls, torches have been mounted to cast a soft glow on the room. 
The only exit is by means of a doorway to the south.  In the middle of the
north wall sits an overstuffed leather chair.  This room is the shrine of
the master assassin, and it's where assassins come to be educated in the
ways of killing.
