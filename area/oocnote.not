PK is a part of exodus, If you do not want to get pk'd do not log a fucking pk alt
If you can't handle that then delete your pk alts
There will be no bitching tolerated about being pk'd during quad or double
That is a great time to catch an opponent off guard and it is how the game is played
Fucking deal with it, If there is bitching continued I will jail the alt that bitches for however long I desire
Whining to Avariel or Duiwel over this will do you absolutely no fucking good.

Subject PvP / Looting~
Text
Keldar has the main gist of what I was going for. 
Let me elaborate.

It was my thought to remove nopk protection from the game and enforce it manually.
Under this type of regime, PK would only be acceptable if both parties agreed
or if two clans were at war.

The fact that your clans are at war is a good enough reason for looting.
However, looting more than 3 items would be unacceptable.

If your clans are not at war OR you're killing a person who is not in a clan,
there would be expected to be a solid and believable RP reason behind the kill.

Looting while not at war or on a non-clanned player would be limited to
one token item, and still generally frowned upon without a good reason
for why your character would be stealing something.
Sacrificing people's equipment would no longer be tolerated under ANY
circumstances, and would be followed up with appropriate punishment.

This has been tried before and failed, because the immortal staff at the time
Did not bother to govern PK at all. It was just an open bloodbath and everyone was
a loner.

My plan is to take out 'loner' all together.
And just remove noPK protection.

Why? You may ask. The answer is because it makes the RP atmosphere more enriched and believable.

I didn't expect Keldar to state this publicly yet, so I understand that people
will have questions and concerns, and when I have some free time I will try to explain
how I imagine this working more thoroughly.

We're not going to do anything that wil piss off everyone. But just know that if
we do go ahead and do this, we will make sure the game is still enjoyable for all.
Below level kills would be punished SEVERELY without RP reasoning.

I really wish that people would stop being so goddamn retarded about this.

"Liches have a natural allergy to healing prayers."

that is, Paladins and Clerics.  PRAYERS.  Healing spells that have holy light
as the source power.

Nature-type healing spells should clearly work on Liches, as they have a lichborn
ability to immediately corrupt all nature around them, including that cast at them.

Bandages I could honestly go either way on.  If it works on Kalians, it should work
on Liches.  They're both undead.  That's the only limiting factor, as bandage, again,
is not a healing PRAYER.

Now stop it!

Subject RE: Liches + Bandages, rethinking~
Text
Actually, in classic fantasy terms, bandages are only useful in stopping mortal
wounds, unless they have a natural or magical salve applied to them, allowing
for direct and immediate healing.  If you look up the item description for 
'bandages' in some of the more common RP/Fantasy games that have them, you'll
find they almost explicitly list some sort of additional healing property other
than just being a bandage.  

Monks aren't a specific 'holy' class in Exodus, which would lead to reason their
advanced bandaging skills come from natural wisdom instead of the holy light.
And, as I stated in my previous note (and literally hundreds of times before when
people have asked about Liches and Ranger/Druid/Bard healing spells) Liches have
an ability to corrupt and benefit from natural corruption, as opposed to being hurt
by it.  If anything Liches should be more powerful against druids, as they are quite
weak vs. clerics and paladin.  Not the other way around :-p

Granted, there are a couple places where Exodus Liches deviate from normal 
fantasy inspired liches:
For one, Liches are supposed to be the most powerful form of undead creature.
Obviously that can't necessarily be the case for a player race, but I'm not sure
I'd call Kalians and Liches equal.  Also, Liches are typically extremely intelligent
which isn't really the case in Exodus, as they are actually a few points behind Kalians
in intelligence.  While hard to kill and quite hardy, Liches *should* be the best undead
spell caster.

The other main feature is that Liches always have a Phylactery, which is the only way to
'kill' a Lich, as it contains their soul.  Obviously this was just skipped over when creating
Liches in Exodus, but since I was pointed out differences I thought I'd throw it out there
for reference.

Basically, the Liches body is simply a unholy and unnatural vessel, as the soul is typically
present elsewhere.  In this light, bandages actually do make sense for Liches, as they would
help to hold the physical form together when it is being hacked and slashed at.  The physical
form has ZERO value as a 'life force' but rather for continued functionality, so Bandages
actually make the most sense as a healing method, where as as their ability to corrupt non
holy based healing spells is more based off their direct Exodus lore in the ability
to defile nature.  

In any case, its pretty clear in the help files and the way the class was originally
coded that they intention was not to have them be immune to ALL healing spells, ranger
bard and bandage skills were always an option, and there is no reason they shouldn't be
as these are NOT prayers.

Few things.

If I understood correctly, you got the two restring tokens AND an uncommon item.
The first place winner (Sabotage) got 5 tokens and a very rare item. He won the quest.
any prizes given out to people who still wanted to take the time to put the puzzle together
are merely consolation prizes.

Immortal tokens, like the carnation or Keldar's fireworks, are good for both restrings
AND are like normal quest tokens.

If the other Imms feel like 2 tokens or an uncommon item isn't a good enough prize for a player
who didn't even actually win the quest, then you can fix it.

I'm not sure if I ever explained clearly to the two of
you where exactly I was going with the different types 
of tokens that are availabe. So here's a breakdown:

`kQuest Tokens `h(1292)``: Are quest tokens, usable as 
per help qtoken.

`nRestring Tokens `h(1620)``: Are restring tokens, 
usable as per help restring.

`gRelocation Tokens `h(1769)``: Are tokens use to change the
wear slot on an item. I haven't done a help file for
these yet. All relocation tokens come with a free
restring.

`bImmortal Tokens``: Are tokens that act as BOTH restring
OR quest tokens. They can be used as either one. These
just add a bit of fun to the game RP wise, and are like
your 'mark' as an immortal. They should go hand-in-hand
with whatever RP route you've chosen to take for your 
IMM.

My persoanl token is 1737. Keldar needs to create an 
object a vnum for his (They should all show up under
vnum token), and Dui still needs to make one.

Subject Heroes and Bullshit.~
Text
Before the age of Iverath/Iblis fuckery, Heroes just got every skill/spell in the 
game like imms.

The reason being is that a hero alt is generally someone who has been playing the 
game for at least a decade (consistently), knows the world inside & out, has helped 
to advance the game in some way, be it through RP, ideas, or just generally being 
helpful. Not to mention all heroes go through a rigorous multi-staged quest that a 
few have just given up on and said, "I don't really want to be a hero that badly."

In short, a hero isn't your run-of-the-mills player, they've proven themselves to be 
above and beyond what we expect from a normal player. 

It takes years of work, respect and perseverance, focusing on ONE character.

Our current Heroes are Lune, Tripp, Naslander and Talonslayer. If you feel one or 
more of them don't deserve the title, we can discuss that. But generally, Heroes get 
cool shit because they earned cool shit. Additionally, the player base usually has
a say in who does and doesn't become a hero.

There was a -lot- of complaining when Heroes got stripped of every spell/skill in the
game and were left with just the ability to restring / not starve. Those two things
in and of themselves were definitely not enough to make Hero as prestegious a title
as it really is. 

Dui and I decided we would give Heroes 1 skill/spell that wasn't PK related and that 
would serve useful to the other players. We chose gate over portal because being able 
to portal to another player is a PK advantage. The idea that any hero who would use 
that to PK isn't a hero, is silly. A Hero is expected to uphold the RP of their 
character. If Tripp / Naslander, or even Lune, for that matter, had the ability to 
just pop over to any person in the realms and kill them, you don't think that with 
their personas, they wouldn't use that? If they didn't, I would be disappointed in 
their RP.

Heroes are not here to cater to new players / help older ones. I'm not sure where this
idea came from, but it's way off base. They are expected to continue with their role as
they always have, and be a model of what a good player is supposed to act like. Exodus
is a PvP mud, killing someone else using the tools handed to you is not out ouf line in
any way, shape or form. 

Tripp, Nalsander, Lune and Talonslayer are all exemplary players. Because of that, they 
tend to be helpful and kind to new players, while still managing to uphold their individual
roles as beasts or crazy people. Please don't confuse the fact that they are good people
with the idea that all heroes are your personal servents. 

Four people on the mud having special abilities because they worked for over a decade to
earn those abilities does not completely fuck up your class, nor is it cause for jealously/
hostility toward them because they have something that you do not, or something you feel
should be only yours. 

Additionally, I am really sick and tired of hearing people complain and abuse Tripp because
he has gone to great lengths to create an alt that yes, by all means, shouldn't exist. It
shouldn't exist because no one ever expected a player to do THAT MUCH with ONE alt. But he 
has, and he's earned every single thing he has. When you work for 11 years on one single
character, learn the entire game like the back of your hand, and spend hours upon hours
doing quests and getting tokens, helping other people level, helping other people grind for
gear - the list goes on and on - then you'll probably have a Hero alt with kickass stats
too.

If the tables were turned, and it was your decade-old character that you worked endlessly on
that was on the cutting board here, I think this entire conversation would be non-existent.

And, one last tiny thing - Every one of our heroes uses their abilities to help other players
anyway. Very few of them partake in PK and if they do, they rarely if EVER loot. Without even
being told to, they go out of their way to take the on the role of Hero and wear it well.

Well I agree with you Ava however by the definiton of hero that you just gave neither Talonslayer or Lune deserve to be heros. Talonslayer is barely ever on and Lune MPs to pop eq for his alts and not only does he get to stay hero he gets no ty
pe of punishment whatsoever. Heros are supposed to be role model and neither of these two are and frankly i think if the player base were to vote neither would remain a hero either.
Tripp and Naslander are the only true heros on here as they should be and with the pb the way it is should be the only heros period.

my idea was just that. an idea. if it's not doable then fine. 

Regarding Tripp I know I have called him OP before, and it's true, he is, however
I also though I made clear that I understand and accept and have zero qualms with
his being OP because he worked hard for it and earned every single piece of eq
and/or rune that got him to where he is today. I never had a qualm about him being
a hero. He's a great hero. I know I said last night that it's frustrating that heroes 
have gate and therefore as a mage I feel like an advantage has been taken away, 
however, I never expected gate to be removed and/or such a conflict to rise from that
statement. More than anything, I was frustrated that gate was taken away from a 
hide n' seek quest and that is one of the few advantages mages typically have 
over other classes and I didn't enjoy not  being able to use that advantage during 
a quest. Of course, this brings up lots of other issues like can a druid skry and 
can a cleric nexus. Yes. I know there are lots of issues with that, and I didn't mean
for this to blow up. Avariel made a comment, I was simply stating my reasons for not 
participating and ka-boom.

Subject heros and my 2 cents~
Text
A player spends a huge amount of time here, plays day in and day out, gains levels, earns rewards and gets to level 90.
Next logical step is go for hero, only if that player wants to put in more time and more work.
That player, should he/she complete the quests, get the player votes and be deemed worthy in the eyes of the Immortals, deserves the Hero title.

Here is where I agree and disagree with a few things.....

I agree with the idea of a hero getting gate and lore. It makes sense and I feel that they deserve both.
A hero should have the ability to "know" everything about an object. They are a hero and that seems logical.
I also think a hero should get gate. They have spent how many years walking all over the damn place here and know the world of Exodus better then any of us.
They deserve a break and not have to walk every damn where anymore. They have earned it!

Here is where I disagree and why.....

I don't think that using gate in a pk should be allowed.
Our heros are suppose to be above us. They have spent years getting there. I think that a hero deep down knows that gating for pk would be a bit much.
It is also something that a non-hero character can not protect themselves against.
It is a different story for a hero character to use skills/spells that they gained before hero status.
Those can be protected against if you try hard enough.
But to use something that only a Hero gets, against another player that is not a Hero and can not protect against, I feel is an unfair advantage.
Yes, I agree that Tripp and Naslasdars *RP* would dictate them to use gate for a pk, BUT
I believe in the person behind the character, and I believe that taking an advantage that would give another player almost no chance of defense would feel wrong to both of them.

I never remember a Hero HAVING to help anyone if they didn't want to. I can say that the current Heros have been most helpful since my return
and have shown amazing and wonderful roleplay when few others have.
It has ALWAYS been a Heros own choice to do with as he/she wants.
To think that Heros are here to tank for us, pop eq for us or to help us level is in my opinion outrageous.
A Hero has done the time, had the patience and had the balls to spend a good chunk of their lives here, IN A GAME.
If said Hero wants to sit on his/her ass in DSC and laugh in everyone's face, I think they are entitled to.

Just wanted you to know I decided to take a sabbatical from the mud
for a while. I will probably be gone for at least 3 weeks, if not longer 
I'm just so tired of feeling like crap. This game isn't fun anymore. Except 
when I get to hang out with you, and I'm sorry I'll lose out on that, but 
I need a break, at least for a while. I'm not worried though, our friendship
perservered over much longer time apart. I'll miss you!

I just wanted to say to all 3 of you that I am so sorry for the disrespect and total lack of decorum with the current player base.
I am sad and just a bit pissed off with how they have been treating the 3 of you since I have returned.
It shames me to know that there are people out there who would do what some of these players have done.
The 3 of you work very hard here and put in long hours and lots of time at the expense of your real lives to make Exodus a fun and enjoyable MUD.

Just so you know, I appreciate all 3 of you and all the hard work you put in here on Exodus every day. It means a lot to me that I can come back and play after 15 years.
I hope that the 3 of you can know that I am not the only one who appreciates and respects you.
Thank you so much for everything that you have done and will do in the future for Exodus.
It really does mean a lot to a lot of us players.
Thank you again for everything and I am truly sorry for the fuck-ups of the few.

After obtaining a 90 alt, the next logical step is *NOT* to 'go for Hero'.

I just want to make that clear.  Hero is not a tier of players that you 'go for'
It's something that's earned over a tremendous period of time playing this game
constantly, knowing how to get around, knowing where things are, what gear is what
how to kill 'boss' mobs, etc.

If one's goal is to play Exodus for a 90 alt and then 'go for Hero' then I regret
to inform you that you've doing it wrong ;)

Text
I've said this before:
There is NOTHING special about how Padfoot or the area he is in resets.
There are THREE reset times in the entire game.
NORMAL - Area pops in about 1-5 (avg 3) with no players in it.  
Otherwise the reset timer varies from about 10-20ish ticks.
NO_REPOP_WIA - Mobs will not repop while any players are present
in the area.
NO_REPOP - Mobs will not repop until the mud is rebooted.

Those are the only settings we have to work with, Padfoot is
on normal.

I've made Padfoot slightly harder by shifting some immunities and resistances

I was curious to why Rahu is allowed to keep his sanc gem when Tripp, Lune, and Algiz all lost their quest items that gave them skills.
After all the sanc gem is just a clerics sanc spell at like 90% because it doesn't work all the time but its the same principle and Duiwel said that you were not
allowed to have items like that granted skill
just to be clear also I'm not saying this out of spite or jealousy or whatever just in terms of being fair

Subject Asking for Nerfs/Buffs and Trolling Notes~
Text
Notes, specifically the idea notes, don't function well if they because a whinefest
like other MMO's Forums are.

Overall game design and class balance is a precise science and trolling the
notes system with one begging for one move or another to be buffed or nerfed
beyond reason due to outrageous claims or justifications is obnoxious at best
abusive at the worst.

If you have constructive, thought-out suggestions for us, by all means
use the notes systems to inform us of your ideas.  If you just got owned
by someone, or by some class, or simply feel a specific move of yours
should own someone else much more than it does, and you find you have
to struggle to justify the reason, using outlandish means or over-
realism, then you should probably take a time out and rethink why
you think a change should be made.  Perhaps take into consideration overall
game design and balance between classes and between types.
(Exodus somewhat lacks from the Traditional MMO "Trinity" Tanks, Melee/Ranged DPS, 
and Healers... we simply have Casters and Melee DPS.)

Subject Why Naslander Will No Longer Be Active.~
Text
I wanted to write a note on why I am quitting playing Naslander.  I dont think Druids are 
necessarily OP, but I do think warriors are underpowered. I have been fighting the top players in 
exodus since I returned and noticed a troubling trend. I keep getting my ass handed to me which 
never happened before. I am not a rookie player obviously and at one time was considered one of 
the best PKers on the mud, see showstats 1. The problems lies in the many nerfs made to 
warriors that has made them quite impotent in todays Exodus. Dual Wield was nerfed to allow for 
more balance but now we dont hit anyone due to coding changes. When fighting both Sabotage 
the non fighting classes are allowed now. Lets go into a real fight and even if you have the best 
gear on but I am a better fighter. I am still going to beat the shit out of you regardless of what gear 
you are wearing so why would the warrior continually miss? Other problems lie with other classes 
that make them painful to play such as throw, assassinate, bash are all useless in the current 
Exodus. Additionally, the large HPs players now have is ridiculous. Vro'ath at one time were the 
one class who could get about 2k now every player can reach it easily. The only solution I would 
see is to raise Vroath base or reduce other races bases, or reduce hp eq amounts. Furthermore, 
warriors are an eq based class but everyone can get the same stats now with eq that is out there. 
In what world should a mage, cleric, druid, or bard have over +100 hr/dr and -400 ac.  Vroath are 
supposed to be the toughest warriors and the current balance makes it extremely tough to both 
have fun as with my RP and normal playing. I roleplayed quitting because any honorable Vroath 
would remove himself as leader if he could fight anymore. It is frustrating because 1. I like to be 
the best or at least have a shot at being the best. 2. Want some balance to the game without 
nerfing everything. 3. Don't really want to bitch too much because most of it will be coding that I 
have no idea how difficult will be to do and not going to demand it be changed. Additional changes 
would be to make fireshield break entangle in a couple rounds and do more damage also. The 
Paladin is a great class that comes with a fierce Dragon and I really see only minor tweaks to that 
class (with trample dragon can breath acid or fire). I realize every class has skills to counter 
others but I fought every high level class (minus Ranger) using all techniques to defeat them and 
lost. My last fight was the last straw after watching a druid win in a straight fighting match with me. 
Nothing can convince me a warrior w/ highest end gear non-(SQI) would not beat any druid. I 
don't expect to OP but I do expect to have balance. All the battles I have fought were rarely so 
one sided even when losing. I wish you all good luck and hope you have fun playing.


Regards,
Naslander

I'm sorry for flipping out on you three and frankly I'm tired of apologizing. I have no right to expect you guys to forgive me because it's no something that happens every once in a while, it's becoming
a regular thing. I know I've been an asshole and I honestly don't know why I am. I'm fucked up in the head. To Ava specifically, I'm extremely sorry. I know how much time and effort you put into
Exodus and I really should show you the proper respect seeing how you don't have to do it. In regards to other things I need to learn to let shit go. You apologized and it should be left at that.
You don't need me bringing it up everytime I get my panties in a bunch. I treat you like shit though and I don't expect you to treat me any better. To Dui, frankly I stay pretty calm when
I'm not being an outright smartass. I don't necessarily feel like I've crossed the lines outside of being a whiner
That being said i do need to apologize to you for the way I talk to your wife. I should be lucky that you haven't come and beat the shit out of me for it because I'd fully understand why.
Cami, I  keep flipping out on you and you don't deserve it either. You more than anyone deserves my respect seeing as you are on
my side when the situation calls for it. I treat you like shit on occasion and it's uncalled for
You guys all strive for balance between the classes and i shouldn't bitch without hearing the ideas. I'm sorry to all three of you and this is the part of the apology where I am
supposed to say that it won't happen again but all three of you know that it probably will since i have no control over what i say. 
I am extremely sorry to all three of you and i do, believe it or not, appreciate everything you guys do around here.

Umm, I don't think anyone fixed this before I saw your note...
I see a typo in your note "The description says "A bright tellow wide-petaled lily.""
but I do not see a typo in the store:
"[30   103 -- ] a bright yellow wide-petaled lily"


My thought is that 'Tellow' was just a typo within the note, and you perhaps
thought 'petaled' was a typo?  It is not.  Am I correct?  Or is there something
odd going on here?

Subject The Week of RP~
Text
Greeting Denizens!

We are going to be running an experiment here on Exodus, starting Saturday, 9/22/12,
and ending Saturday, 9/29/12.

For this week, I would like everyone to remain in character. The OOC channel will be
entirely disabled.

I will also be disabling the gossip channel, not because it's unacceptable to use it,
but I think that some of us -overuse- it. I don't fault anyone for that, I think it's
hard to get into the swing of RP and we, as a group, are just used to public channels.
Therefore, I'd like to disable gossip just to nudge you in the right direction and
reform your habits a bit. It will help define a clear line for you as to what you should
and shouldn't use the gossip channel for. If at any point during the week you think to
yourself, 'Dammit, I REALLY need to use gossip for this.' - then you've found the line.

On the 29th, I'll re-enable the OOC channel and things will be allowed to go back to
normal.

I really feel that a lot of you, even those initially averse to something like this, will
warm up to it rather quickly.

I don't really want to force RP on the mud in the long-run, but I know that some players
here really enjoy it, and I think this plan will help everyone to both have some fun and
strengthen your roleplaying skills, as well.

I know some of you have never even had to RP, so I will be writing up a little guide on
general roleplay etiquette in an OOCN to follow. You can use it for referencing how to
express certain things like stats, leveling, etc.

I think immortals who are active PKers should not be able to see clan talk channels for any clan
except their own. On numerous occasions I have felt incapable of saying something on 
my own CT channel because an immortal who plays an alt in an opposing clan could easily 
see this conversation and use it to their advantage. And lets face it, it's human 
nature to use it to their advantage. I get that. Which is why it should be removed. 

I had Gryven auction a vial to me because I wanted to see who would bid on it. And 
surprise surprise, a thief wanted it. A thief who really has no business collecting empty vials, 
unless of course he saw over CT that Zurg ordered me to fetch vials from 
thesden in order to brew him some potions right away. And surely I could not tell Zurg
I would run out and get those potions right away because surely, 
that information would be seen and used to their advantage.

That's tricky to enforce.  Also, I don't exactly understand why your "test" proves

Yes, they badly wanted to get rid of 1000 silver. That makes perfect sense.


I know my test wasn't perfect, but it's not just during the times
that someone is actively hunting us that it's a problem. Last night
Zurg wanted to discuss Forsaken and he has to call us all to the
same room because a certain immortal is on. Actually. It being
Forsaken, there are two certain immortals almost always on 
that would see it CT. It's like dramatic irony - the 
audience knows but the other players don't - except when the audience
is a player as well it serves a problem - because human nature says
to use what you know, even if you stop being an immortal when you're
off hunting, you can't ignore what you already know. And if we plot
to kill Tripp by attacking him while he's tanking someone, well, 
he's going to know that and isn't going to sit around and let it 
happen. No offense Tripp/Keldar, but you're just not. Neither would
Andariel, she however leaves herself open to PK a lot more because
of tanking in the Abbey. The point of it is our CT isn't exactly
CT anymore - it's just an OOC Channel because anything Clan RP 
related falls on ears of active mortal players who interact with us. 

I know that Immortals are supposed to be supervising us,
however ClanTalk should be viewed as Tells. They're essential
private conversation bewteen clanmates. If an immortal felt
there was something inappropriate going on, then fine, snoop CT
for a few and see if anything is going on - but other than that, 
it should be left on IMO. 

I appreciate your initial response and look forward 
to hearing back from you again regarding this manner.

Greetings again!

RP week has officially begun as of 9/22/12 3:00PM EST. It will end on
9/29/12 3:00pm EST.

Let's make it interesting! At the end of the week, I'm going to have
everyone pick someone (that isn't themselves) and vote for them based
on how well they RP'd. These votes will be completely anonymous.

The winner will get something cool. And the losers can't bitch because
the winner will be chosen by the players! It's the PERFECT PLAN.

If you need help with your RP, feel free to send me a tell. That will
include any question you may have as well as if you need a (frill) 
item made or a gecho or anything that might help further your RP that
you as a player can't make happen.

During RP week, please try your best to keep any OOC conversation to
tells or group tells, and only if you have consent. (see help roleplay)

Have fun, folks!

I don't think killing OOL is a big deal anymore - you lose 1 level 
and most people who are doing it have so much XP stocked up it's really no
big deal that they don't even consider it, unless they're 
a hero. I think there should be a harsher punishment so people 
can go PK at a lower level and not worry as much about the higher 
ups getting them just because they can gain the level back right
right away. Tahnks

If you have a complain about a specific room flag - ESPECIALLY if it is widely
and randomly used, you'll need to supply me with a list of room names.
There is no way for me to easily find them without actually looking at the editor for each room
which isn't going to happen until we have the C# version running and I can just query
area files for shit like that (currently that flag would be part of a string and not just
in plain english).  That goes for any complaint of this nature.  There are VERY few
things we can query for in plain english.

GM EQ is a perk for those who take a full class exclusively.  As for equivalents, most classes
can find great gear on the bosses in the highest level areas.  Ask around for some tips.
While it would be a nice feature, I don't think we can item edit the class flag
off of an item you've acquired using qTokens.  Although, 25 qTokens would
allow you to pick up any equivalent item.  Again, you'll have to ask around
a bit to figure out what exactly that might be.

I realize that on some level the idea was for you to redistribute the items

such items -- and you gave her the items of your own volition, and without 
direct prompting from her.  But, it is a MP transfer regardless.

Subject Tattoos~
Text
Well, I have kinda figured out what was wrong with Tattoos.  
The problem wasn't Squinty's level, or him lacking all_skills, but instead
that the ITEM - that Tattoo items - were level 50, and they did not have
the power to restring or load objects.  
I am not sure what changed in the code or when to prevent this, but I am pretty
sure this has been the root of our ongoing issues with OTs for a long time
now.
As a result, level 90 players can now use the Angels Wings and Stonerose
tattoos if they wish, as these are what I was testing with.  The rest of
the Tattoos are still level 50 AND WILL NOT WORK.  
If the change in order to fix advanced OTs working on lower level items is harder
than anticipated, I will make all the Tatoos for level 90 characters, (or perhaps 82 will work).

The other problem was that Squinty doesn't function properly at all when I'm switched
into him, as the tattoos cannot force me to do certain things as they can force Squinty to.
so that was also causing some conflict in figuring out the root of the issue.  

Let me say again, to Immortals:  If you want a specific NPC target of an OT to perform
a skill, they typically need to have ALL_SKILLS toggled on.
If you want the OT itself to perform certain commands, the ITEM the OT is attached to
MUST be 92-100, depending on the command.  This is for the time being only and will 
hopefully be addressed quickly.

Stay tuned for more info!

need my stores restored, also quick question - does the problem with player stores also relate to player boxes?
only reason I ask is because all my player boxes are empty despite them being in no_recall, no_bash, no_pick locations.
this also is applicable to ironwolf as well (found his rooms)

I agree with Keldar. 

But what's funny about all this? If you had posted an
OOCN to 'immortals' instead of 'all' and worded your
plight a little better, perhaps something like:
`a
Hello guys. I see you have changed the magus robes. I 
understand, they were very powerful. So powerful in 
fact, that I spent a relocation token on one. As you
know, these are very, very rare. I would not have
spent the token if I'd known that my item would then
become rot-death. Is there any way I can perhaps 
trade in the item for my token back?
``
-- There's a pretty good chance we would have said 
yes. But instead, you just charge at us, guns blazing,
without ever giving us a chance to make any kind of
rational decision. On top of that, you do it publicly
In everything you do or say here, you always put the
immortals against you right from the get-go. No one
wants to help someone who doesn't even give you a
chance to rectify a wrong. I would have given you the
token back, now you will have to deal with the 
consequence of your actions.

As far as the pBase goes, it's shitty that it's so dead, but I'd honestly
rather have no players than disrespectful ones who make it their goal to
incite drama and pussy-tease members of the imm-staff into doing their
bidding. 

At our most active we had 5 - 6 players, most of them imms, so it's
not like we lost 20+ people, we lost 3 people who are all in bed together.

Look at all the fucks I give.

I haven't been able to be around for quests / facebook updates or general
interaction at all because Brett and I have both been working fervently on
getting Exodus v3 done. It's about 2/3 there, and will be done in maybe
another month, perhaps two.

We will be the first ROM based mud to convert to C#

When that is done, we'll (finally) tweet it, we also have some pretty solid
exposure set up for the launch aside from that.

A -lot- will change and you won't lose your chars, but we will be running
another conversion.

I won't reveal anything else here, but new classes, areas, races, and
just all around new game-dynamics are coming. :) 

If only for the interest in seeing a C# version of ROM, the pbase
will be back on track, with or without you, Kaige.

Text

I am still here. Not very often right now cause real life got in the way,
but I am still around.
I don't think Lynne has dealt any "shit" that people didn't deserve to get in the first place.
She has been busting her ass to get Exodus up to a better standard,
on top of taking care of her own life outside of the computer.
The consequences are simply that in the end we will have a better and stronger
player base. All that is needed right now is a bit of patience.
I think that the amount of disrespect shown to immortals here is horrible.
If anyone thinks that Lynne is mean or rude, then you haven't dealt with Cailet at all.
Be thankful that Lynne still allows you to be here.
Cailet just banned people for being rude to her.

I think that for right now, those of us that are still here should just have some patience.
Once the C# change-over is complete, we will get new players.
It will be our job as the current player base to be here when that happens.
To offer help to newbies and to show them what an awesome place this is.
Exodus doesn't need people who bitch and complain or show disrespect to our immortals.
What Exodus needs are players who are willing to come and play here.
To enjoy being a part of this little world and to have fun here.
Exodus will have its glory time again soon.
Have some patience and show some respect.
All of the immortals work hard here and are working harder now then ever before.
If anyone can't at least be respectful to those very few people who are making Exodus better,
then I say good riddance.
Those few people who are disrespectful on public channels and in public notes
are the reason why the player base is so small right now.
We come here to escape the drama and shittyness of the real world,
not to add to it with in line text fantasy shittyness.

I for one will still be around when I can be and when real life allows me the time.
Looking forward to C# going through and making this place even better.
Lynne, Thank you for all your hard work and time. I appreciate it even if others don't.
Thank you as well to the entire Immortal staff for everything you have all done.

So I am not sure who to talk to about this and since you know everyone here I thought I would bring it to you....
Renthier aka Steven Kuhns has been texting me for a few weeks now. He has talked to me about numerous things (some of which seem completely attention seeking) 
He seems like a seriously troubled guy and I listen to him mainly because I dont know how to gently tell him I cant handle more problems than the ones I already have.
Yesterday he told me he has been cutting himself up he is so upset. I dont need this shit and I am trying to find a tactful way of saying so. 
I thought since you guys mudded together for awhile you might have a better insight in to this than I would. 
Although I know your straight forward approach gets taken as rude and uncaring I have seen you handle things with grace and intelligence and wanted to see if you could apply that here and tell me how to handle this guy.....
In all honesty I feel like I am getting forced to watch a really bad soap opera through text messages daily and it is driving me aboslutely bonkers. However I dont want to just say fuck off like I would with most people 
due to the fact that this guy seems completely unstable. 
Thanks for listening.
