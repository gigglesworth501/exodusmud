nonexistent.  It would appear that someone or something has purged this room
of all signs of inhabitance.  A pungent odor is prevalent, and there is a
strange presence in the room.  There is a doorway to the south.``

dragons and knights floating in the air.  The knights seem to be fighting
the good dragons and riding on the backs of the evil red and black dragons. 
This place must have inspired the most hearty of evil warriors.  The hall

running down both sides. The lighting here, although still rather dim,
is better than in the rest of this immense complex. Strangely, the room
does not feel empty. If you are quiet, you can almost hear the murmuring
of many voices in the misty gloom. There are decorative carvings on the 
walls. You hear voices inside your head, stories of warriors in battles 
and of fights with dragons. You feel completely at home here. Then one 
more voice enters your head..."You are part of an eternal tradition."``

`aThis large room was obviously designed to prepare food for a mob
of growing boys. There are two immense cooking hearths in this room, with
kettles on them that would each hold enough food to feed a small army. The
most notable thing about this kitchen, however, is the group of people
working at the hearths and tables. If they weren't partially transparent,
you would almost think they were alive- but they are, of course, merely
not dead.``

Practice room~
This immense room is laid out in lanes for crossbow and hurled weapon
practice. There are targets at the far north wall, and the room is marked in
distances by numbers on the floor. The targets are attached to the ceiling
and could be adjusted with pulleys from your position, if the ropes that
went around the pulleys were not rotted away. The targets could be set up
as suitable ranges for any type of practice, from thrown daggers to long
bow.

`bThe Arena``~
`aThe Arena still continues its immense growth but seems different 
here. You see four statues in the corners of the arena, all which are 
mages with thier wands pointing to you. Suddenly you hear a voice...
"So you think you are strong enough to best me? I know that is why you
have come to this place. And that is why I have been waiting here for you.
For I am Stephan. Stephan, do you hear? The very name should make you
tremble with fear. You silly little wretch will soon feel the power that
is mine to command! For mine is the only way. If you seek to leave this
place you must go through me. Kill me if you dare!"``

`bMage's Room``~
`aThis room has pictures on the walls which seem to move of thier own
valition.  They are pictures of mages, each in the act of casting a spell. 
Some of the spells you recognize, lightning bolt, fireball, but some are
completely outside your experience.  The pictures seem to run through a
sequence in two or three minutes then begain again.  Each time that the
pictures change though, the scene is slightly different: a variation in
background, a different mage casting the spell, etc.  ``

to be a class in session at this moment. There is a robed form at the back
of the class facing the wall, and a group of vague dark forms sitting at

The masters room~
In this room stands an ornate, archbacked throne, apparently carved out
of a single block of stone.  It faces outwards, towards the door you
entered.  The separated bones of a single human skeleton drift lazily in
midair above the seat of the throne, shifting about in an endless jumble. 
The skull moves but is always facing outwards and turning to look at you;
the only bones that are not part of this endless, silent dance are the feet
of the skeleton.  These are on the floor, positioned as if the skeleton were
sitting on the throne.

furniture consists of a large eating table, a sideboard, three large
reclining chairs woth foot-stools, a high stool and a desk.  Two shelf units
are also along the walls, home to proudly displayed weapons and a few thick
books.  On the far wall is a fireplace, a merry blaze crackling within it. 
It is surounded by an ornately-carved stone mantle depicting armored human
knights riding dragons and competing with elven knigts on Pegasi.  Overhead,
the dragon and Pegasi riders motif is repeated on the carved panels of the
ceiling.  Brass cloak-hooks project from a human-sized arch of richly
polished wooden paneling just inside the door.  The arch-topped panel
contains a fold-down wooden bench, and is carved with a large, complex scene
of birds singing over a pool where a unicorn bends its head to drink.  You
don't hear anything but the faint crackle of the fire.``

The haze~
A blue haze seems to rise before your very eyes, silently and rapidly,
seperating the world around as you stare at the cryptic inscription.  The
inscription seems to consist of a number of names and other nonsense,
followed by the last line, glowing in deep blue common lettering: "If you're
reading this, of course, its too late."  Blue radiance is everywhere; you
are lost and floating somewhere not quite real.  Blue, shifting light is
under, over, and all around you.  The light begins to fade, and you realize
that your legs and feet are colder and wetter than the rest of you.  You're
somewhere else, all light goes black and you are standing in inky, dark
water as deep as your thighs.  A faint purple light comes from your left. 
Ahead of you, in the distance, you hear the water rippling as something
within it moves...

`bThe Warrior's Bloodgrounds``~
`aThe floor of this huge room is covered with a layer of fine sand. 
Perhaps warriors trained here long ago
it appears to have been a practice
arena at one time. The light in here is especially intense, and the 
temperature is noticeably warmer than in the other rooms. You see the
markings of Chaos everywhere.``

`bThe Knight's Hall``~
`aYou stand in a grand hallway.  You look at all the work and dedication
that it must have taken to construct such an atrium.  Carved figures, which
represent warriors of every race, stand proudly with swords raised in a
toast to you.  Gold and silver line the hallway and you see images of
dragons and knights floating in the air.  The knights seem to be fighting
the good dragons and riding on the backs of the evil red and black dragons. 
This place must have inspired the most hearty of evil warriors.``
