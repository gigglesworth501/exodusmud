`dThis old gnome is short and plump, with a long unkempt `owhite `dbeard. His eyes``
`dare slightly crossed. He paces about his cage relentlessly babbling on in``
`dincoherent sounds. Occasionally he will pause, but only for a moment, then will``
`dproceed with the continuous loop.``

`dIn a Large Rock Chamber``~
`d  The narrow passage opens into a fairly large chamber. The air is slightly``
`dwarmer here, but just as putred. There is a large `nsteel `dcage situated in``
`dthe center of the chamber. It was obviously too large to be brought through the``
`dpassage behind you so it must have been assembled one piece at a time. Inside``
`dthe `nsteel `dcage a small humanoid seems to be muttering incomprehensible``
`dsounds.``

`dthe cage muttering completely incomprehensible sounds. He is positively insane.``
`dBetter keep your distance.``
