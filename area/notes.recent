Text
When I was lagging last night, I would do a quick traceroute (not every time,
but more than a couple).  I was losing numerous packets in the (ironically)
XXXXXXX.exodus.net network.
It was passing through about 5 or 6 routers on that network (which sort of says
they aren't configured correctly or at least efficiently) and losing packets at
several of them.  I cross exodus.net about 3/4 of the way between here and 
/but I think exodus.net is still in the northern virginia region and I doubt
everyone was crossing through there.

It turns out that exodus.net is the company that provides the
backbone connection for our campus. Yeah, the name is ironic.
What is truly sad is how poor our connectivity is through them.
Since we switched the 'lowest bidder' phenomenon has become quite
stark - and directly parallels the 'you get what you pay for'
phenomenon. Eh... life at a university ...

Subject call mount - level 35 thoroughbred~
Text
For paladins level 31 to 40, call mount will create a level 35 mount,
a thoroughbred. This baby is configured wrong some how. It started by
telling me I was too heavy. So, to test it I stripped down to my bare
naked self. Stripped, with a weight of 4, the mount still told me I was
too damn heavy. As well, for some reason this mount did not follow me,
as the other mounts do.

Could you fix this? Please?

Everytime I read a note about how ome player in greenwood is doing something they houldn't, I feel slightly nasuausious.
I wa aware that everyone joined greenwood because they were of good or neutral alignment, (suggesting that they had a kind or nice attitude) and yet you all don't seem to agree.
Zurim, if you don't like high level players, Why did you join GreenWOod? I don't like people calling me or some of my high level friend arrogant or corrupt.
It to simple to blame being rude to people on RP. Obviouly its not hard to be a jerk, But almot everyone i know doesn't eem to realize that its hard to RP NICELY.
If you don't like people, DOn't join the clan. I'll talk to both Zurim and Treehugger when I get a chance, and then I can consulkt with the deputie, especially Loric after he gets back, And we can come to a decision on what to do about you two.

and kill me. 

Although I am not of your clan, it is a most goodly day and

Why do I feel so alone?  Why is the world always changing?  Why does it seem like Im the only one who
doesnt?  Where is the end?  What do I have to do to get there?  Why does she always leave me?  Am I supposed 
to close my eyes?  When is it far enough far enough?  Why did you leave me?  How come you broke your promise? 
How can I help?  Why does she do this?  How many is too much?  What am I supposed to do with this?  Where did 
we come from?  Why do roses always smell sweeter before you put them on a grave?  How come I never missed you 
before you were gone?  Is this what love feels like?  How can I get away, from myself?  How many times a day 
can you smile?  Why are we here?  How come the guys on Star Trek always get things done on schedule and I 
cant seem to do it?  Why wont she let me wash away her tears?  How come things always seem to slip through 
the cracks?  Why cant I make everything better with a single word?  Why does she always want to talk?  Why do 
the cracks always become canyons?  Why does rain fall?  Why did she back away, when I know she needs me?  How 
come everyone with a law(science) was German?  Why are God, and Hair the same thing in Japanese?  Why cant I 
say what I mean?  Why do the stars seem so bright right after we got in a fight?  How come she hurts herself? 
Why is it so hard to say, I love you?  How many times does it take to get to the top?  How come clouds 
dont look like anything to me?  How come I always feel peace, when Im walking?  How many times does it take? 
How long do I need to microwave it?  Why do red roses remind me of blood?  Why cant I stop her, why cant I 
make her stay?  How the heck do I fold this stupid map?  What time is it?  How come my boxers always ride up? 
What is Veal?  Does anyone actually know what happened?  Will I ever get over Breaking up?  How long does it 
take to break in shoes?  Why are girls always cold?  How come music makes me sad even if its happy?  How do I 
keep her happy?  How come you can never think of jokes at the right time?  How come my jokes hurt other 
people?  Why did you break the promise?  Why did you leave me, why didnt you care?  How come everything slips 
though my fingers?  Cant I just have it My way for once?  How much does it cost to supersize?  Where have 
all the cookies gone?  How come I can never remember the words to my favorite song?  Why cant I just take her 
in my arms and hold her forever?  Why does life remind me of a rose, Breathtakingly beautiful, but filled with 
sharp pinpoints of pain?  What does it mean to live?  How do you thank the stars for always being there?

Thank you for your most recent note regarding Reilly.  While I really don't
care if he tells the world your alts or not (because if they were meant to
be secret, you wouldn't have told anyone who your alts were in the first place)
, I do care about that business regardnig sexual harrassment... etc.
I have taken care of the situation with him for now.  If he becomes a
problem in the future, I will take care of it again.

Thank you for informing us of Reilly.  However, in the past two notes 
you've been quite... how shall I say... abrupt and very..ummm.. graphic in
your notes.  I can understand that there are things on the MUD that upset you
however, that really doesn't justify the profanity in your notes.
As for killing noclans and the like, feel free.  If you do, you will see 
freezing and a possible character deletion for doing so (among other things).
Whether you choose to do so or not is strictly up to you, but by warning the
imms ahead of time of what you plan to do is accomplishing nothing other than
aggrivating us.

SO, my advice is to keep up the good work being a studious, concerned player, 
but to stop the threats about what you 'will do if...' notes to the imms and
please stop the profanity in them.

Subject `oRegarding `nRing `gQuests``~
Text
Heya,
Nano and I dont particularly want to do a ring quest before our marriage.
I asked Moonlyte if it was manditory, and he thought it probably was, but
he told me to write you a note, to ask you to make a new policy regarding
ring quests.  The reason Nano and I do not wish to partake in one is that
we don't particularly want to die before our marriage.  I am told that one
of the reasons for these ring quests is to prove to your spouse what you
are willing to go through with them.  Nano and I believe that we have already
proven that to one another.  Ring quests in themselves are not particularly
realistic anyhow.  I urge that you consider to make the policy regarding ring
quests as a optional thing.  Moonlyte would like you to post the new policy
on the news board.

Thank you for your time,
-- Augustus

Subject Ring Quests~
Text
Augustus and Nano,

I am willing to forgo the ring quest, as I have been considering
changing the policy for some time now. I know the reason that it was
implimented here, and although it does have a small amount of validity,
it seems to have had little or no impact on the duration or quality of the
mariages on this mud. Furthermore, it makes little sense.

Immortals, I would like you're input on a change to this policy:

Ring quests are optional, and even encouraged for RP reasons, but not
mandatory. If the couple chooses to do the ring quest, they are given
a restring of any item they posess as prize for completing the quest.

If they elect to exclude the quest, they must pay for any restrings they wish
to use as wedding items.

Chronos has a good point. I removed Augustus' loner flag only
after Augustus claimed that Moskha approved it. He was
the wrong alignment for Backwards. But now he has changed
his alignment to angelic, which is okay for Backwards.
Though he changed his alignment, he saw no need to change
his plan, which still said he was in Backwards. Well, I got
Augustus to admit that he didn't change his alignment to
angelic so he could stay in Backwards because Backwards
"wasn't worth it."
And I got him to change his plan for what it's worth.

Many years ago, deep under the sea, Canthi seers' seeing the evilness of the drylanders,
sent forth warriors to bring back children.  A child for each of the drylander races,
a prophet of justice.  They brought them to an isolated island, and there they reared 
them, showing them the virtuues of justice and co-existance.  Each of the children grew
up in different ways, the Dwarf a female named Caryan or Daughter of light in Canthi, 
showed great devotion to Malakai the god of justice to such a degree that she became a 
cleric.  And Ashi-ton became obsesed with magic, becomeing a powerfull arch magus.  The
others were bards, and even a human paladin.  Then there came a split, the sidhe, and 
the Vorath were touched with the troubles of their races.  Their dark rebellion was put
down quickly and with deathly effancency so that justice could continue.  Now only the
Syvin, Elven, Dwarfish and Human representatives still followed their teachings.   
Caryan, and Ashi-ton took the lead and leaveing their Canthi teachers who had quite 
abbruptly left them on their own in this strange new world.  They went forth to 
proclaim justice among the drylanders.  The times have changed, and only a few 
descendents of the first Members still strive for justice, each follows it's forfathers
path.  There is no ruler among the Judgement, but rather there are two, A dwarven 
Cleric and a Elven Mage in rememberance of Ashi-ton and Caryan.

Only: Human-Paladins, Elven-Mages, Dwarven-Clerics, or Syvin-Bards can join Judgement.

Text
Very glad to see you are working on bards. Here are a few suggestions. I'm
not saying we should do them all, just throwing out ideas.
1. Wall of Sound: blocks all entry/exit from a room for a few rounds. Or
just builds a wall around the target so s/he can't leave.
2. Dance of death: Forces target(s) to dance wildly with several possible
effects: big minus to hit roll, big + to ac, chance of self injury if fighting,
lose ability (or 50% of ability) to use spells, songs, prayers or skills, etc.
3. A variation of (2) could be the skill Comedy (or joking): it would 
incapacitate the hearer for a shirt time, maybe make them wet their pants
and drop random items, etc. [This one could be fun. -ed.]
4. group haste (as a composition)
5. Some sort of monster summon song (Call of the wild?). It could bring a
random number of monsters of x level to the bard's assistance for a few
rounds. Like with mage summon, it should backfire sometimes.
6. Quiet Mtn Lake should be changed so it doesn't affect the bard who sings it.
Mages and clerics just cancel it, warrior types just bash...the bard is screwed.
7. Bards need to be able to PLAY songs in combat. Alternatively, mages should
not be able to recite scrolls in combat. One or the other is a must fix.
Alternatively, quiet mtn lake could still affect everyone in room, but it
should prevent all spells, songs, prayers either for xrounds on each target
or for xrounds in the room where it is played. So either the room or targets
would be silenced for a bit. If not this, there could be a bard song that
specifically blocks spells/songs prayers:it could be quiet thing or an extra
loud thing that drowns out all other noise: Awful Racket or something.
8. Tab (or Tygre) long ago suggested a very cool thing: bard jam sessions.
There could be two or three super songs that would require two or three
bards to play together: could be super elyteness (mass elyteness?), a portal
song, a super quake( very strong, maybe affects room and all adjacent rooms?),
etc. There are lots of possibilities, but the idea of songs requiring multiple
bards is cool. They maybe would have to be of similar alignment to be in tune
enough to work together or something.

Anyway, there's a few ideas. One main problem now is that mages can make
themselves virtually immune to bard stuff. Once charmed, the mage is immune
to charm, anti-sleep drugs are easy to get, bard songs don't go through mirror,
etc. This needs to be fixed. One way is to change charm, so that it doesn't
preclude future charming. Either have it disappear when the charm is "broken"
through combat with charmer, quitting, leaving the presence of charmer...,
or make it so folks get fight lag when charmed, so they can't quit then
return uncharmed right away. Or do both, really. I think charmed mages
should also be unable to recite scrolls. It's silly to charm a mage and then
be blasted with a double acid blast.

Thanks again.

Subject Several Complaints~
Text
This is just a follow-up note to our conversation we had tonight, Zurim.

Basically, as you know, I've been getting a lot of complaints about you.
They range from multiplaying your characters, attacking noclans, using vulgar
language on channels and harrassing people.
This is just a friendly warning asking you to stop.  Several logs were sent to
me today regarding the harrassment and frankly, it was borderline. 
It was enough to get me to talk to you and write you a note, but not enough 
for me to freeze you without a warning first.
When someone asks you to stop spamming them, please do so, whether it's you
sending them tells constantly, or spamming a spell in Devon Square or whatever.
Harrassment is kind of the same thing... where you send someone tells over and
over but they may not be the same, you can harrass someone by shouting or 
says when you're in the same room or even over channels.
Roleplay is one thing... harrassment is carrying it further.  It's a fine line.
Often times it's up to me or another imm to determine when that happens.
It's better to not even go there than have an imm decide one day that you're
harrassing someone and then freeze you, when you felt it wasn't harrassment.
So it's better to not even risk it, right?

The multiplay complaint has no evidence.  You know the rules regarding multiplay.
If you've been found to have multiplayed in the past (and we do keep track)
it'll be worse for you if you're found multiplaying now.

The attacking a noclan thing I talked to you about.  In this case you had the
noclan's permission and that absolves you from any freezing this time.  Please
don't do it again, whether you have permission or not.  I've posted some guidelines
in a new 'changes' note.

I know it's easy to shoot off one's mouth on channels when one's upset... 
I've done it myself.  However, when you continually berate someone, it turns
into harrassment if you're not careful.  Please try to stay away from it at 
all costs and save everyone a lot of headache.

Subject Censorship and Implied Cursing~
Text
The current rule on censorship of public channels disgusts me.
The actions of the immortals show that there is no reasoning, if
there ever was, on this rule.  The only reasoning I can see for this, 
although I do not agree with it, is to protect younger children that 
can frequent our mud from the terrifying virus of language.  Now
this is enforced by disallowing the use of words such as fuck, shit
or bitch.  However, f*ck b|tch and $hit are allowed?  The implied 
meaning is exactly the same.  If one word is typed instead of another
against someone, they would most probably understand them and react 
upon them exactly the same.  So why is one censored and yet the other
is perfectly allowed.  If a child saw f*ck instead of its counterpart
they would probably understand what letter is missing and what word
is being used, defeating the whole purpose of the rule.

It seems we may have some charm bugs that need looking into.

There are a couple of complaints of charmies not fleeing a battle after
the owner of the charmies die. I personally believe that charmies should
act as though the owner fled, thereby fleeing the battle, and become
un charmed as well.

Also, Azgarth logged off, logged on Ironwolf, and somehow ended up with
Azgarth's charmies. Not just in group, but full control.

Text
It seems this was a known "feature" of the mud.. I dunno, I don't play bards/mages
much anymore. I'd seriously like to see the charm after death to be changed.
As it is now, charm continues even after death. All spells and effects
are lost on death, and when the master of the charmie flees, the mob
flees with it. As it is now, the charm after death goes completely 180
degrees opposite the consistancy of all other spells etc.

It also opens up a bug with charmies that hunt. If someone disbands after death, the mob is instantly aggie
to the last person the mage ordered to attack.. so Even after the mage
dies, he can disband and let his charmies hunt down and kill the target.

questions, comments, concerns?

The whole point of not cursing is that Exodus is supposed to be a family
mud. This means that people of all ages play here and out of respect for
people who find it offensive, we do not wish people to curse. I agree with
Paarshad in that you can't allow people to use a symbol in place of a 
letter and say it's not a curse word anymore. That's rediculous and
defeating the purpose. If you want to keep the channels, notes, tells, etc.
clean then just make any form of cursing illegal. Otherwise, if we are
not concerned with offending some players, get rid of the rule. You 
can't have your cake and eat it too.

For once I am going to have to agree with paarshad, but I agree 
with him only in that I believe that the language rules are idiotic,
but my reasoning is slightly different than his.  I wonder why it is
ok for small children to engage in play violence on this mud (ie killing
the hell out of mabs and butchering them) but they should not be 
allowed to hear "bad" words.  It does kind of make me sick how violence
today is considered ok but simple words are so tabo.

Kalus' note suggests some chages -- These would be easy to implement.
Just let me know which way it should go. BTW, I basically agree with
Kalus on this one - on death charmies should probably be lost.

Lastly, we have code that can charge a mage/bard mana for every charmie,
every tick of the game. This is another change that I think would help
reduce the reliance on charmies. I think we should consider implementing
this change.

Subject Charmies~
Text
I would not be opposed to having charmies gain control of themselves at the time
of the charmers death if:
A)  Charmies affected by The Piper's Melody but do not have a master, may be
re-charmed while still affected by Pipers.  Currently, if a Mage charms a mob
the Mage can disband, and then re-charm the mob if need be.  This is not so for
Piper's.  The song has to wear off.
.... and B) We have some way to either make sure the charmies do not wander home
for at least 5 to 10 RL minutes, or we disable the autoloot features that some
mobs have.  Currently, knights such as Eagle and Ocelot knights loot corpses.
So in theory, you're a mage or bard, you die, you lose your charmies, they loot
some if not all of your corpse and then the mobs wander home.
As far as your gear is concerned, you're SOL.   If we can assure mages and bards
that this type of thing won't happen, I wouldn't be opposed to it.

As far as a mana cost per tick for each charmie goes, I'm not against that either
provided that we strengthen the Magic-User and Bard classes first.
What I mean by this is, we fix the bard songs that do not currently work right,
allow Song of Elyteness to be played during combat, and possibly give Bards a
couple of new songs in a new (optional) song group.  Additionally, please tweak
Bards so that at level 90, even the stupidest of races with the lowest of charisma
can have control of at least 4 mobs at the same time (if not more).

Mage Class:
Try to tone down badsummon just a tad.  Increase the ways a mage can do damage
without needing charmies.  This is especially important for Sidhe Mages who have
the lowest # of hitpoints out of all classes and races in the game.  Not all
Sidhe mages rely on charmies, however, charmie use is a VERY important staple of
Sidhe mage killing as they simply don't have the hp's to spare a couple of lucky,
chance hits.  One way to do this is to increase the damage that spells from the
Draconian spell group do.  Currently that group is WAY overpriced for a mage to
want to gain it.  If the spells did more damage, it might be worth it.  Also
if we weren't going to do any Draconian changes (although I really do think we
should), then we should think about Mage Scribe being bumped up to 3 spells per
parchment.  I say Mage Scribe, as this would enable Mages to kill off weaker
race/class combinations in one blow, much like Cleric Exorcism or Thief Assassinate
can do now.

Subject charmies (aka mage & bard changes)~
Text
cool ... btw I hope everyone recognizes this as a design discussion
and that all immortals kick in their opinions here...

Moonie give two conditions that he thinks should be enforced before
the charmies get their freedom (on the death of their master):
Condition A: The pipers affect wears off immediately (to make Pipers
and charm equivalent under the conditions of the death of the master).
IMHO: this is easy to fix, we can do this. {My argumentative side
takes possession of my typing.} But why? Pipers *is* different from
charm. If we want to make them the same then let's fix it so Bards
can only get 1 charmie per play of Pipers. Basically, should these
two things *really* be the same? What about this alternative... we
cut the lenght of time of the affect for Pipers in half upon the
death of the master (if the bard *just* charmed them - then he only
waits half the duration of his normal charm affect length).
Condition B: Freed charmies don't wander home or we disable the
autoloot feature. IMHO: again, easy to fix at the C code level.
{My argumentative side again takes over my fingers.} Ok, but why?
It seems we want to make having charmies a complete benefit with no
downside. Everything should have some associated risks. What if this
was a somewhat random thing? We perform a roll vs save against the
mage/bard who died - if they 'succeed' then we fix the charmies so
that they don't loot the corpse (if the charmie was a looter).

Mana per tick concept: I agree both Mage and Bard need some help in
the damage area. -- Now, oddly, the changes that we recently made to
to Pipers resulted in making Bards more equipment dependent (FYI, to be
good a Pipers bards need +int and +cha equipment). Fundamentally, this is
probably a good thing and I believe we should carefully continue to make
both Bards and Mages more eq dependent. One change that will support this
is making eq class/race specific (will be in the next build). Now, with
mage/bard specific eq we can make charm/pipers cost per tick and offset
the costs by having some relatively rare equipment that provides nice mana
boosts to the wearer. This and some help with the damage thing and we will
reduce some of the reliance on charmies.

I don't understand what Moonie means by 'at level 90 even the stupidest
races should be able to control 4 charmies.' This should not be a level
thing. Controlling charmies has always been an Int and Cha thing. A player
who is playing a Bard or Mage and makes it to level 90 should *know* this
and either collect the right equipment - or spend their trains such that
they up their int and cha appropriately. I'm not sure about this specific
requirment. We should think very carefully about that. Right now I'm not
in agreement with this 'stupidest of races' requirement.

I've been reworking Bards and I could really help with some ideas for
more songs. Please kick in your suggestions.

I've been thinking about changes to thief. The big change in the works is
to give thieves a 'trap' skill. I could use some suggestions ideas about
this before I run off and do something really stupid.

I think us mages should get clan points if we kill with charmies.
It is one of the few ways we are capable of killing warriors and

can exorcise my ass and get credit for the kill, when really his power
comes from his God. And yet my powerful charmies don't count for me. That's
unfair.

I could care less about dying or getting looted in a clean PK
The fact is smart_hunt charmies hunt after their charmer dies and that is what caused my death.
Paarshad helped me prove this to kalus and it is now documented.
Today's kill was clean and I do not mind it, I mind the fact that you think because oro made the killing blow
he got a clean kill, when the fact is I would have hunt him down and killed him as easily as Erize.
I dont mind dying, but when something like this happens maybe you should look into it instead of assuming
I have a problem with PK.
I know you didnt do it on purpose and I have not accused you of such.
There was a genuine problem with the situation which malakai should have immediately looked into
in order to avoid was has occured since then.
I noted this to Moonlyte and Kalus because they are fully aware of the circumstances.
I do not expect my punishment be lifted, but I would not have lost my temper if my issue was addressed appropriately.

HI!
I looked into your envenom complaint, and actually, you can 
envenom a large number of common weapons. A quick way to know
whether or not a weapon can be envenomed is if it has a special flag, like vorpal or
sharp, it can't be envenomed.

Thanks for pointing it out though - it's certainly something all

I think bard charm should attract more charmies. But I think that those
charmies in both cases, mage and bard, should be freed from the control
of the master upon the master's death. It doesn't make sense to have them
still charmed when the master is dead in either case. Who is their master?
The same goes for mounts and pets.
Once you die, you should start anew.
I also don't think more +mana gear is needed. I think mage spells
should kick more ass. A lack of mana is not a problem for mages.
I think that flying characters should be immune to bash. At the most
they could get "knocked back" for a round. Otherwise, flying creatures
should land on the ground when bashed and lose the fly spell.
And it should be almost impossible to bash someone who is flying.
All in all, if we downgrade reliance on charmies, we should upgrade
the other spells and songs with which mages and bards might pk.

Allies in Clan Twilight,

Clan Brotherhood has severed the alliance with Clan Alliant due to the recent
decisions made by Lord Havoc.  Havoc has returned from Alliant only a short
time and has already made two big mistakes.  First, Havoc decides that Alliant
is better off with the person who almost destroyed it, instead of the person
who saved Alliant.  Then Havoc lets Cory rejoin Alliant after his period of
sevitude to the Dark One.  Cory may or may not be "cured", but that does
not change the things that Cory did to both our clans and the city of Thesden
during his reign as the Dark One's servant.  I tried to speak to Lord Havoc
his decision, but he told me that we(Alliant's Allies) should just forgive and
forget.  I told Havoc that Cory should seek forgiveness before reward, and
that he has yet tried to apologize for the grave things he's done to Alliant's
allies and the city of Thesden.  Havoc returned no answer, and I then told him
that I would have to severe the alliance due to his poor decisions.  Havoc replied
by saying that he believed my decision was a mistake, but we need to walk our
own path.  I believe that Havoc's leadership is being clouded by his strong
friendship to both Warren, and Cory.  I believe that anyone who stands with
Havoc will just be hurt in the end due to another bad decision.

Moskha will now be without a computer for quite some time.

I will be talking to him on a regular basis over the telephone
throughout the time that he will be without a computer.
If you need to talk to him or get a message to him you are

message to him for you.

Thank you for bearing with us durning this problem.
I have already been yelling a postal workers about this,
but I do not feel better about the whole situation.
Moskha will try his best to log on once a week if he can,
but with the way things go he may not get that chance.
I will be posting notes with messages from Moskha as he asks me to.

Well...I come on here and see that one of *my* wedding presents is presently

which immmmmediately alerts me that someone is either in my house or just was there
at which point I say on OOC that whoever was auctioning that had better stop
and that it was MY stuff and was illegal to be breaking into a noclans room
course...noone said anything....I went to my house..mine and Jarrens...and saw that my door
had been bashed in....(its stillll bashed in 3 days later)...and that some stuff from my box is gone
which I already assumed.....so...last night wyrm and nano see that a chest was donated
with...whatdyaknow...my stuff in it...so she gives me back my stuff....and I put it back in my box
but my door is still bashed in and its driving me bonkers....I'm pissed that some idiot felt it ok
to be bashing in my door in the first place...but not much can be done about it....
this is the *third* time this has happened to me amongst my alts..(2 times to MiC)...

That sucks.  I really sympathize with you as that thing has happened to my own
noclan alts in the past.  As it stands now, to prevent a door from being bashed
or even the lock being picked, a flag has to be put on the door.  Both nobash
and nopick flags are available for 10k gold each.

As far as the culprits are concerned, if there's any hard evidence (such as 
witnesses who saw the crime being committed) we can try the person who did it as
it *IS* illegal to loot noclan rooms (as indicated in the current rule set).

Lastly, I need to know who the actual room owner is.  I took a quick look through
what I had and didn't spot your name.  Is the room owner Wyrm or someone else?
Catch me next time you see me on.  Once I figure out which room is yours, 
I can see about re-installing your door.

Actually don't worry about if the loser who took my eq can't confess thats there problem
If they end up getting caught i hope the punishment would be a freezing for a 1-2 week period for looting a nonclan eq
I am going to just ruin this care by claning with Varruk
since there is way to many pricks on here that dont follow rules and or there killing rp
I tend to find Exodus growing but sickening more and more
You can rely this message to who ever you wish for i don't care
I have been here for a while when most the imms were still here
When all the good rp pkillers were here and lets say Exodus was much better
But now adays all the good imms left along with the good players
The rp has been shot down the drain and pkillers kill for no reason
And well i think you imms are doing a great job *trying* to make Exodus as best as possible
But face it theres imms never on if they are they totally ingore us and are wizinvis
Exodus will never be like it used
What Exodus needs is a solid imm who has played here often and who can be on alot
NOT me off course im not exp in most of Exodus yet but someone who has ben here a long time would be nice
I really don't care if you think im bitching or what have you.
I am just speaking my mind and what most the facts are right now

This mud has been dead for more than a year know and it is just getting worse. This mud is now a mush made up of building and killing mobs!
THis is a mud for beginners now and not for anyone that wants a challenge or wants to rp! The bias towards non pk is absurd ! 
Everyone here is too nice! I am sick of this lets not kill cause we might upset someone! I miss the days of rping with the clans and having a purpose of clans! The mud should go to no pk, oops it pretty much is!
Maybe I am just one of the old players who no one cares about but just throwing my opinion in ! Maybe I will get silenced! WOohoo

I agree with Thorasan
When i started mudding here which was close to a couple years now
Those were days that everyone had fun killing each other while claned and pk
I mean a player called Famine was a riot to get killed by back then
But now a days someone dies they bitch and moan
And depend imm help for ether reimb in levels or something else
This mud altough may have newer code is getting crapier and crapier
I myself have started looking for a new home to mud on.
When Exodus starts being like it was a couple years back then i might play more often also
Until i will be just stoping by and checking notes and maybe to chat with a couple friends
Until next time when ever that is the mud decides to get better.

First of all, for all those people who think the mud is just great
the way it is, open your eyes and take a very long look around!
I'm not going to discuss why I believe the mud is dead because that
would take too long, I'd just like to point that Kerberos has been playing
here for more than a year.  During this time he's played on a mud thats been
dead for quite awhile now.  I mean he's played constantly on a mud that hardly
had people on it, I know because I'm usually on when he was and when I'm on
there isn't more than 6 people on.  For someone to mud through that can't be 
called a crappy player, and he isn't leaving because he dislikes one thing.  Atrok
and Serena, you two just need to open your eyes before you decide to criticize someone.

Oh and on a side note, if Atrok isn't kissing major ass then I believe someone
needs to write up a new definition.

Everyone is entitled to their opinion.  On the side of those who feel that Exodus
is dead, they feel that those who have positive feelings about the MUD are
brown-nosers.  Those who have positive feelings regarding Exodus feel that those
who don't are whiners.

As in all things in this world, everyone is entitled to their opinion.
As for this place, Exodus is a game.  You log on to play here.  If you're not 
happy with this place, then why torture yourself by staying?  If you are happy
with this place, I think it's terrific that you can find someplace to unwind
from RL troubles.

As for those who speak negatively about Exodus (whether you're happy with the 
MUD or not), we do listen to you.  I'm very sorry that things aren't moving 
fast enough for you.  Although I am not currently looking for immortals, I AM
accepting area builders.  For those of you with some coding ability, you *MAY*
have a chance to code for Exodus on a limited basis.  Talk to me, Akamai or
Shinowlan if you're interested in coding and I'll see what I can do for you 
(although I don't have any guarantees).

For those of you positive people out there, thank you for your support.  It's 
much easier to do things when people are encouraging you rather than when people
are putting you down.  Your kind words and helpful suggestions really are welcome
and they do mean a lot to me.

Lastly, Exodus is what we all make of it.  If you care to contribute to Exodus
by building, helping newbies, submitting useful ideas or even asking for immortal
help to run a quest, your contributions are very welcome here and I will do my
best to see that all of you who DO want to contribute can do so in some way, shape,
or form.
In closing, I will be completely and utterly frank with you.  Although I, and 
the other imms here do listen to what you all have to say, I tend to give MUCH
more attention to what is said by those who do contribute here than those who
simply throw up their hands and say that they're done with this place.  
I may not have been here as long as some of you, but I have been here for a
couple of years myself and although at times it would have been very, very easy
to simply leave this place and let it die completely, I didn't out of respect
for those people who helped me with my very first mortal.  I will always carry
their memory with me and try to keep Exodus alive the best I can always with them
in my thoughts.

Subject The recent notes regarding Exodus~
Text
Although I meant what I said about how much attention I give mortal notes
(I give more attention to those that contribute to Exodus than those who do
nothing here), I do look at all the mortal notes to all, just the same.

Many of the notes I see, and I don't mean just the recent ones, have to do with
the big gap between what pk'rs (loners/clannies) and non-pk'rs can do to each other.
Over the past couple of years, the gap between these sides has grown as well as
the resentment between the players who play both sides.

I have a very strong opinion on this matter.
From the beginning, Exodus seems to have been built upon the free will of the
player.  Players can choose to be non-pk, can choose to go loner and can even
choose to join a clan or create their own.  They can choose to break Exodus
"laws" and risk being wanted and jailed for their crimes.
On the other hand, choices such as breaking Exodus "RULES" can adversely affect
others and if there is not an Immortal present in situations like those, there
is no justice for the victim.  A case in point is a noclan being purposely killed
by a clannie.  If there are no witnesses and no imms available, it's simply one
person's word against the other.  The noclan loses experience and gear in the
process and gets no reimbursement as the code is not at fault.
This is but one very large loophole in the system.  People seem to be very tired
about the choices offered to them as the lines between both pk and non-pk are
so blurred now.  
My suggestions regarding this may be difficult to implement, however, I really
do feel that they are very necessary for this place to continue:
We really do need to examine how to hard-code what people can and can-not do.
It is completely unrealistic to say that people should have a choice regarding
whether they decide to go bonkers as a level 90 warrior and go on a noclan 
killing spree simply because they're tired with Exodus and want to go out with
a bang.  If you as an Immortal can't actively be here for let's say 3 or 4 hours
a day, every day, why should any other Immortal be here for that long every day?
I say this because we don't have the imm coverage we need for situations like that
one.  We either need imms to play for several hours a day and rotate so that 
there's always an immortal available at all hours of the night, or we need to
have many, MANY more immortals here (which I personally think would complicate
matters).  If we do neither of these things, then we will always have victims
complaining that this noclan spelled them down while they were in combat with
someone else, or this clannie slept this noclan, that this person's locked room
with a nobash, nopick door was mysteriously robbed (by a mage who simply 
randomly teleports around until he finds a person's room he can loot)... etc.
Until we can find some way to make the code act as the judge over *MOST* things
and decide what a person can and can not do, we will always be spread a bit thin
and there will always be the level of contention that we have now.
That's not to say that we won't be needed anymore.  No codebase is perfect and
we will always be needed to make judgements on things... just not to the degree
we are now.

I invite any comments, questions or concerns you might have about this.
I have several specific ideas in mind about how we can go about this in case
any of you would like to discuss it further with me (some of which were
previously mentioned by Havoc/Simeon in notes and ideas that are a couple of 
weeks old).

I thought I'd explain my thoughts on this subject.
I believe Exodus is dead but it does seem to slowly progress.  I do not think that everyone that
has positive feelings towards Exodus are brown-nosers.  It's the people who are in so much denial
that they snap at everyone that says any negative things about Exodus, i.e the recent notes.
I've played during the best of times and the worst of times though I still play here even though I
believe its dead.  Exodus is the first mud i've played at and even though I don't play here as much
I doubt i'll ever stop playing completely.  My first note was written to defend someone that I believed
deserved no criticism as such as he received from Atrok and Serena.  He stated his opinion which can
be looked at as pretty much the truth.  Exodus may be alive but what good is life if you can't enjoy it?
In Serena's note she says that Atrok is not kissing ass but is saying what he thinks.  Well thats exactly
what Kerberos did but because it was negative certain people had to jump in and slander him.

I'm not going to write any more on the subject because I think i've said enough

Subject Akamai's note... tangential~
Text
Well, I think there's a big issue here about how much we'd
like the code to do for us. In a perfect world, we wouldn't
have to worry about assholes Multikilling or breaking rules.. it wouldn't happen.
But, we don't. While it would be nice to have code in place
to stop a lot of 'jailing' offenses, I for one believe it's
fairly impractical. Not because the coders take time to 
code, then playtest new patches, but because at the point
where coding would obviate the need for an immstaff to handle
punishment, it would become overbearing. Let me give you
an example. I'm doing feasibility studies on clan EQ at the moment.
There's a way we could do it where each item was no_remove,
no_uncurse, rot_death, and we would just tell everyone that
if they were caught with eq not their own, they'd be transed,
slayed and have their corpse eaten. End of story.. The other 
way would be to have the coders code a 'clan_only' flag,
where it would be impossible to wear EQ not from your clan.
I don't know if someone could give me timeframe on
coding that flag, but I'd be willing to bet that it would
be 6 months to a year to iron bugs out. This COULD be in tomorrow, once we got vnums ported over.
I really think that as a whole, we're a bit to trusting in code to 
do our work for us. It would be nice, but you end up 
overloading the coders, and new things just don't get put in.
I know (on a side note) that this might seem as poking at some
of y'all. I just feel it's my duty as someone who wants this 
MUD to be a better place to try and shed light on things I see
that might need work. There are ways that would not make the 
burden of enforcing clan EQ very taxing ;)

Subject Relying on code~
Text
I definitely do understand where you're coming from, Moskha.
However, that still doesn't solve the matter of there's never an imm around when
you need one.  
Unless the imms here can commit several hours here and work on shifts (which
is very unreasonable, IMHO) we would need several new imms (at a high enough
level to be able to do something) to be able to ensure that there IS someone here
to handle things like this.  People are leaving Exodus because they're tired of
being the victim.  We have rules in place and we have immortals here to enforce
them, yet people still go unpunished because there is no proof of wrong-doing.
This isn't an isolated incident.  It happens time and time again.

As far as the clan equipment thing goes, I'm all for hard coding clan only flags
however I also firmly believe that the coders do have things to do and I have
no problem with putting rules in to cover the use of clan equipment until the
flag is coded in.

Truthfully, I think it comes down to which group you're in.  You are a brand new
player to a MUD.  Would you rather play on a MUD where there is a VERY extensive
rule set that lists what you can and can't do, where you're open to exploitation
from some other player who doesn't care if they're caught or is too slick to be
caught by an immortal right away... OR... would you rather play on a MUD where
there aren't a lot of rules because the code will allow you to do only what the
immortals want you to do (such as a noclan not being able to loot the corpse of
another PC whether they be pk or non-pk, for instance).

Me, I'm in the second group.  I'd rather play somewhere that doesn't have a 
ton of rules that I have to worry about.  I don't want to worry about playing
a warrior and have to worry about losing my gear when I store it in my locked
nobash, nopick protected personal room, because it takes months to get good gear
as I have limited transportation, don't have item identification skills or spells
and can't tell when a good item has popped or not other than walking to reset 
location.  Is it a weakness of the warrior class to not be able to do those things?
Yes.  However, it justified as well and people know from the start when they
create warriors what they can and can't do.  The sad thing, though, is that
they shouldn't have to worry about being robbed if they've forked over so much
to create a room, a box and to flag their door.   Yet it happens every day.

If we asked the mortals what they'd rather have - restrictive code or more rules
to take the place for code, I really do feel confident that they would take
the code side of things than the rule side.

Thanks for your note, Willowmist. It hit the nail on the head:good clans
depend on good players (especially good leaders), not the imms.
Having said that, the clans as we all know are a huge mess right now.
We need to get rid of the dead wood and make room for new, viable, fun
clans to grow. Once again, I suggest deleting all the old clans. We won't
miss any of them. And don't start writing notes about why your clan is worth
keeping. If we can all of them, no one can complain. Let's turn the old
clan halls into museums of clan life in an earlier age, and then move
forward. There's no way this mud can handle more than 6 clans with it's
current player base, and 6 is probably too many. So, delete the clans,
have prospective leaders make proposals for new clans, and then see what
we get. Please. I know it sounds crazy, but we have nothing to lose.

Let me remind you of the history and the purpose of this clan! I am just an old fart now but this clan was never intended for war but for profiting from others that wanted to shed blood from their hatred!

I have started a full time job, and will no longer be on as much as I have
been in the past.  Only visits basically.
I love this place, but I remember a time when everyone on was clanned or
a loner except a couple of noclans, out of 20 people... That time is
obviously gone now... People need to clan more, see how it's like before
letting potential death/looting scare them off, and learning from their
mistakes to get better at survival and defending themselves.  That
is how you learn.
As for Xork, I always enjoyed conversations with him, and will miss him very very much...
He has always helped me out when ever he could, and this is truly a tragedy
and so shocking to me... I will miss his presence and his jokes.. Exodus
will never be the same without him...

I would like to start this note by saying how much I will miss Xork, he had always been a great guy and could
always make me laugh, you will be in my thoughts always Xork.

I have played this MUD for about 2.5 years now, and I without a doubt can say it is THE best one out there.
It has an excellent IMM staff, and great players, and I know it will continue to be a great MUD without me.
I wish I didn't have to take an extended vacation from Exodus, but unfortunately a small group of players here
have decided to make my life here hell.  I have put up with alot of harassment here, but I really don't feel
that its worth taking any more.  I know it's obvious I'm not telling you everything, all I will say is that
someone on the MUD very close to me chose to hate me because i couldn't have an RL relationship with them.
I'm sure I will pop in occasionally in a month or so, please don't wipe my chars.  I would like to thank my
friends here for helping make this a great place: Gleep, Melanchly, Kryian, Kerberos, Azgarth, Tigger, Bushroot
Paarshad and many more that I'm sure I have missed.  Also a special thanks to the immortal staff, especially

Subject Kerberos:  Why everyone's leaving?~
Text
I don't necessarily agree that everyone is leaving and that the reasons why
the people who *are* leaving Exodus are the ones that Kerberos listed.  However,
I do think he has hit on a couple of key issues.

There isn't anything for a level 90 to do after they level.
Granted, we are working on improving hero, however, once you hero, then what?
The way hero will work (from what I understand), heros won't get all of the
skills and spells in the game.  They will have to work towards increasing their
abilities gradually over time, learning new things as they gain in pracs and
trains through questing and turning in runes.
We'll see how well that whole thing goes.

Truthfully, though, I think this is a temporary fix at best.  Unless a person
is questing non-stop, they will not get enough pracs in a timely enough fashion
to gain many spell/skill groups unless we make them so cheap that a hero can
gain a group a month (a group being where it costs 2 trains to gain).
Other than gaining spells and skills, what does a hero have to look forward to?
You could say PK.  PK always adds spice to the game.  Each and every PK has
some sort of special quality and excitement that makes it unique from the others.
It adds spice to the game.  On the other hand, the environment we created is one
where PK'rs are not considered before non-PK'rs and vice versa.  They're treated
as fairly and equally as possible.  As this is the case, what does a level 90 non-PK
hero have to look forward to other than gaining skills?  I can't think of
anything.

My suggestion is that at some point we really do consider going into some sort
of remort system.  Either that, or we expand the levelling system by 500 or more
levels, re-levelling spells and skills and adding new ones.
I lean towards the remort side of things more than I do tacking on 500 levels.
Or maybe, I should say I lean towards a hybrid of both.  90 levels isn't much.
How about increasing the levels to 200, where at 200 you have the option to remort?
We could do that or make things more exotic in the remort system.
My proposal is slightly complicated, but not very much.  It allows for a greater
variety of characters and a greater amount of levels characters must go through
to accomplish things.  In a nutshell here it is:
Characters have the ability to remort to up to two other classes from their orignal
class.  Characters can go as high as level 200, however, the only time they have
the option to remort is at level 100.  For those who choose to level on to 200
without remort, there will be special skills and spells available to them and
them alone.  However, that does not mean remorts will not have their own unique
spells.  After you have remorted once, you may choose to remort a second time
(once you reach level 100 again,) into another "base" class like War, Mage, Cle,
... etc., or you may remort into an advanced, hybrid class.  An example would
be if you were of a warrior class and remorted into a thief, when you were 
eligible to remort for your second time, you would be able to remort into another
base class such as a cleric, or into a hybrid warrior/thief combination which
would be ... let's say for argument's sake... an Assassin.  Assassins would 
have thief and warrior skills, however, they would have special skills for their
own class as well.
All in all, a character would have to go through 600 levels to be at their peak.
If we wanted to, at that point we could add a hero sort of thing, where you could
gain the spells and skills of other base classes.  Super heros could gain any
spell and skill, but that would be after you've gone through X amt of levels as
a hero.

This would require some major coding, I imagine.  However, it would add a great
deal to the game as it is now.  In addition to coding, it would require some
major area writing as well, as we would need a LOT of new areas that covered
a bunch of different levels.

I mentioned that we would need a lot of new areas put in for people to level in
if we were to implement something along the lines that I discussed.  This touches
on Kerbie's second point, area writing.  We have the builder's port up and 
many of you have worked there or are working there.  However, we have not had a
new area installed on the live port in... well... before I first logged on here.
I, myself, am interesting in writing, however, finding the time is tough, doing
what I do here.
New areas would definitely spice things up around here.  Whatever you can do
to push things along would be greately appreciated.

Are you still interested in the building thing or can I delete your builder over
there?  I'm having the hardest time trying to figure out who is active and who
isn't and am just trying to get things sorted out.  BTW, what was your builder's
name again?
