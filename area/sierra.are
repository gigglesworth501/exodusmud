Intersection of Orange and Broad~
Orange Avenue intersects the Sprawl's most celebrated roadway here, Broad
Street, the center of culture and non mainstream commerce of the city.  The
palm trees and fern fronds that usually line the street have parted here,
giving vehicles and pedestrians alike access to Broad.  The road itself here
is a peculiar mixture of old and new, cobblestones (synthetically made of
course) and high technology polymer asphalt blend not so seamlessly into a
crazy quilt crossroads.

Carnation Avenue~
Carnation Avenue continues to the north and south here, a computer
renderd image that leaves you wondering about the technology progression in
this world.  Is automation taking over the individuality of the people and
their willingness to think on their own?  Are people becoming less creative
and lazier in their dependance on proprietary technologies to do the job for
them?  The Sprawl is certainly no fine example of human engineering spirit. 
Sure there are stores here and there, and cute little residences, but its
still a neogothic city, brutal and hard.

Riemann Street~
How unoriginal can one place be?!  Prefab houses have been airlifted into
this section, and placed shoulder to shoulder here.  Row after row of dark
but functional offices (residences) line Riemann Street, orderliness broken
only by the occasional light that streams from an open vent slat high up in
the air.  The buildings tower over the street, making it feel constricting
and in general, too busy and dirty.

Intersection of Center and Dell ~
Center Street seems peculialry short as it comes to an end here with an
intersection with Dell Avenue.  It seems an awful waste of a street that has
massive thoroughput and a general capacity for large traffic loads.  Another
unusual aspect about this section is that there is nary a building in sight.
You stand in a congolmerate of roads that turn and twist their way around
each other in an attempt to go where they gotta git going.

Handy Hills~
Handy Hills comes to an end a short ways off to the south from where you
stand.  But before its unfortunate conclusion, you see a theatre off to the
east that pretty much typifies what Handy Hills is all about.  Bright,
blazon red letters stream across its front, slightly curling script that
flickers on occasion, and sometimes goes completely out.  It says, `i"The
Roxy"`l, a theatre for all types.  Reputation has it that this is NOT a
theatre for all types, but rather a colorful and artistic one that only
appeals to those people who deem themselves to be esoteric enough to enjoy
the oddities of life.  The peculiar, squat structure of the theatre breaks
up the jagged and ugly horizon of the Sprawl, a refreshing change to the
conformity of the city.

Broad Street~
In a curious work of city planning, you find yourself traveling north and
south instead of east and west on Broad Street.  Other than the fact that
the sun is shining on you from a different side, it feels the same here on
Broad, a collection of color and variety.  Every once in a while, a massive
holographic image will pop over the street's horizon, an advertisement, a
benefit music concert, a hacked password file that has been posted to the
holonet.  It is confusing at first, call it information overload, but
eventually, the holograms do not seem nearly so dominating, nor so big, and
complement the ambience of Broad Street nicely.

Orange Avenue~
Orange Avenue runs north and south, a massive street that carries much of
the north south traffic in the Sprawl, independent of the labryinth like
freeway systems that runs somewhere off to the west of the Sprawl.  An
intersection with a small side street is apparent a short ways off to the
south, but not very noteworthy.  The air here has that peculiar tang of
mixed polluted chemicals and artifically scented fern fronds, it might be
pleasant in another city, at another time.

Intersection of Carnation and Broad~
Carnation Avenue and Broad Street seem to just fall into each other here,
a strange intersection where you can't tell exactly where one street ends,
and one begins.  Perhaps it is because of the computer image blurring that
occurs at the intersection, a graphical bleeding that throws its excess
images onto the westernmost portion of Broad Street.  In any case, it is
pretty obvious that Broad Street is one of the main east-west crossing roads
in the Sprawl, as you can see towering buildings, a multitude of lights, and
the smell of crackling food in the air.

Broad Street~
Broad Street runs off to the east here, a beautiful myriad of old and new
buildings, bright lights, fine theatres, tasty food and other attractions. 
Bright blue light floods the street, shining down from large illuminating
beams that have been suspended in the air using hovering technology.  The
road itself is made from a cobbled type surface that, in some ways, sucks to
be on.  But it is the character of the street that has been preserved.  A
change from the same old black polymer surface that is used almost
everywhere in the Sprawl these days.

Broad Street~
Broad Street is a medium sized street that carries a disproportionate
amount of traffic east and west on its two tiered surface.  Perhaps it is
all the attractions on this street that cause people to cut through here on
their way to work, or to play, or to wherever they are trying to go. 
Numerous theatres dot the landscape, as well as a myriad of odd shops,
residences, and people.  Everything seems rather colorful here, although not
gaudily so.  Bright lights have been fashionably put up in front of
buildings, trying to attract people to come inside.

Broad Street~
Broad Street runs east and west here, an eclectic type of street that is
probably the cultural heart of the Sprawl.  It's interesting, because not
many people think that the Sprawl has any culture at all, instead thinking
to think of it as a monolithic giant with no mind or spirit of its own. 
Lights that have been artfully erected grace the sides of numerous buildings
and assorted theatres, shops, and residences.  To the north you see a fairly
large path of green, a definite surprise in this tumbling mass of metal and
oldstone.  Off to the south, you see a building with decorative facade and
sign that reads `i"The Horizon Ampitheatre"`l.

Broad Street~
You stand on Broad Street, a virtual potpourri of culture and color and
sound and noise in a place where they seem so limited and dead.  The Sprawl
doesn't really have much culture or anythang like dat.  But the entire
district has been made up with artistic smiles and bright colored lights
that emphasize how rich this section really is.  Buildings lines the street,
their grey and black and white metallic walls sculpted as if professional
architects rather than crappy city planners created these structures.

Intersection of Broad and Riemann~
Broad Street intersects with Riemann Street here, a crossroads that is
dominated by Broad Street's culture, lights, and ambience.  The utter
boredom and conformity of Riemann Street stretches off in the distance, a
gross pile of grey that is punctuated only with the occasional gas neon
sign, corny and gaudy at the same time.  Broad Street on the other hand, is
culture central.  Theatres and variety shops dot the area, making it one
interesting place to be.

Broad Street~
The smell of cooking food fills the air here, as you seem to have walked
right into the middle of a food bazaar, a collection of stands and booths
that hawk their wares to passer bys.  Only one lane on each tier has been
left open for vehicular traffic, the rest is cordoned off for vendor use. 
This pretty much exemplifies what Broad Street is all about, a fascination
with the oddities, with the peculiar things that make certain people tick,
and make life bearable for others.  It's unusual to find a place like this
in the Sprawl, this city of guns, murder, and generally kewl mayhem.

Broad Street~
Broad Street continues off the west here, a wide street that nevertheless
carries a disproportionate amount of traffic.  People seem to gravitate
towards this street and more specifically, the specialty and oddity shops
and things that are on this street.  Just to the south is a sign indicating
one of the many theatres on this road, `i"The Magination"`l.  Rumor has it
that of all the exotic (erotic?)  Theatres on this block, this is the most
unusual and interactive.  Just to the east is the Loop, the conglomerate of
roads in the center of Broad Street that forms the funnel down into the
heart of the Sprawl.

The Loop~
This is the Loop.  It is a collection of roads that converge in the
center of the Sprawl, just north of the MicroSoft Place, and smack dab in
the middle of Broad Street.  It is a crazy and busy multitier roadway that
reminds you of those old puzzles, Moebius Strips, where you can't tell where
one end starts, and the other begins.

The Loop~
You stand in the Loop of the Sprawl, and what you keep thinking to
yourself, is that it reminds you of the brain of a poor engineering student
who has been working on the same homework case study problem for about three
hours only to discover that the model he made in the first place was off
base.  I.  E.  Mucho tiempo wasted.  Anyway, what that means is that it
looks like a pot of lasagna that was taken out and chopped up before it was
cooled.  If you don't know what THAT look like, its a mess ok?  All over the
place, crap falling off the sides, and cheese dropping out your nose.  Sure
it might taste good (in this case, get you where you want to go), but it
doesn't do much for your shirt and clothing and face.

Intersection of Broad and Handy~
You stand at the intersection of Broad and Handy, a happy meeting that
brings the two most culturally filled streets together here in the Sprawl. 
Splashes of color dot the area, and large, artistically decorated signs have
been erected around the crossroads.  A large theatre stands off to the
northeast here, the angle you are standing at doesn't permit you to make out
just what the name is.  In any case, it look stately, as if one of these old
theatres could look anything else.

Broad Street~
Broad Street runs to the east here, away from the impersonality and mess
that make up the Loop, the central ganglion of roads that converges just
north of MicroSoft Place.  In any case, Broad Street is one of those
deviations from the Sprawl's norm, a pleasant looking area that focuses more
on culture than on guns and violence.  Theatres line the street, their
bright faces covered with prettily done up lights and other decoration.  Off
to the north here, shaded trees and bushes frame a massive greenish area,
judging from the animals roaming about inside, its a ZOO!

Broad Street~
Up and down and over the road, its a fun place to be.  Smiling faces and
colorful lands, its everything and nothing together.  Its a life of ness and
entropy its living a life of art, its the way the color of the neon signs
changes when the wind blows across its surface, the way that odd stray piece
of paper floats from place to place, but somehow, next year, it ends up
three thousand miles away.  It's the butterfly that is flapping its wings
somewhere over the vast void that surrounds the Sprawl, and making it rain
two days from now.  Its randomness, its fun, its Broad Street.

Intersection of Broad and Judge~
Judge Street runs at a less then perpendicular angle to Broad Street
here, running off to the south almost triangularly, leaving the block here
shaped into triangles.  Judge Street is a contrast to Broad Street to say
the least.  It is a colonial revisitation to the greysteel, modern ribbed
architecture that is so boring, but ruthlessly efficient in its nature. 
GreyGreyGreyGrey and the occasional lights is all you see, you might want to
stay on Broad Street some more and soak it all in.

Broad Street~
Broad Street runs east and west here, a colorful expanse of culture in
the midst of the rigidness of the Sprawl.  SUBLIMINAL MESSAGE: Don't you
hate when you mess up a test question that you knew the answer to?  Back to
our regular programming now.  There are many places to go, and different
people to see in this section of the Sprawl, theatres, museums, and other
attractions abound, that doesn't even include the amount of skin you see
visible on the neighborhood tramps and sluts.  Oh what a night it might turn
out to be!

Broad Street~
Broad Street takes a crooked corner turn here, an embankment in the
bright lights and artificial cobblestone road that comprise Broad Street.  A
huge sign has been planted in the center of the road here, reading
"EarLobe's Wax Museum".  An arrow further prompts you, pointing to the east
in an obvious attempt to get you to visit the wax museum.  Who knows, it
might be an interesting lesson on history about the Sprawl.

Orange Avenue~
Orange Avenue runs north and south here, a wide thoroughfare that is
lined with artificial palm trees and fern fronds.  The entire street smells
something of pineapple juice after it has been mixed with bile and other
assorted vomit.  In other words, it doesn't smell rosy.  Massive air vents
are concealed among the fronds, structures that not only make it smell
better here, but make it possible to breathe as well.  Green green green all
over and under and over and under and poof, its gone.

The Loop~
Loop, Loop, Fruit de Loop, around and around we go, up a road, down a
road around a road, through the road, onto the next tier, over the next
ramp, under the next bridge, down the flipswor.  In fact, you don't know
where the hell you are going, its a mess here, and only the experienced
traveler in the Loop can figure out where he is going.  Just for reference
and sanity's sake, the Loop is centered just north of MicroSoft Place and in
the center of Broad Street.

The Loop~
You stand in the Loop, the conglomerate of roads and streets that make up
the core of the Sprawl's transportation system.  Numberous tiers of road
travel are available here, as well as the wide number of road choices that
you have.  Most of the streets here are of the brand new black polymer
stretching surface that increases the contact patches on vehicles.  Only
high tech down town here in the Sprawl.

Intersection of Orange and Malvern~
You stand at the intersection of Orange and Malvern Streets, a break in
the almost continuous jungle of ferns and palm trees that grow along Orange
Avenue.  Malvern Street seems very austere, few people choose to live there,
not because it is a run down district, but because it is more of a
commercial district.  Warehouses can be seen off in the distance, grey brown
structures that have sharply sloping roofs and paneled walls.

The Loop~
The Loop turns and twists among itself, a curling whirling dervish of
streets that lead the way into MicroSoft Place, the heart of the Sprawl. 
From what you can see here, the Loop consists of 20 or 30 tiers of roads,
and approximately 10 horizontal strips of road.  They converge upon the Loop
in all directions, it is very difficult to tell where everything leads. 
What you do know is that the Loop is geographically located somewhere in the
center of Broad Street, quite an unusual place for a traffic conglomerate.

The Loop~
The Loop runs up and around here, a 20 to 30 tier madness of roads that
leaves you with absolutely no idea where you are going.  Vehicles whiz back
and forth on the road system, like an army of ants preparing for battle. 
The Loop is located somewhere north of MicroSoft Place, the heart of the
Sprawl, and somewhere in the center of Broad Street as well.

Orange Avenue~
This is Orange Avenue.  And guess what, the street isn't orange, its
black!  How about that.  It is one of those confusing paradoxes that you
might never to be able to figure out.  One of those introspective things
that you think about when you are alone late and night with nothing better
to do than play Magic against yourself.  Why would they name this street
Orange Avenue if it weren't orange?  Weird...

Benson Project~
You stand in the foyer of what once was a housing project.  The ceiling
has collapsed to the south, preventing you from going any farther down the
dimly lit, and shabbily carpeted hallway.  However, a creaky staircase still
looks usable, despite the grease stains on the walls, and the large worm
holes eaten through the borders of the staircase.  A single 60-watt bulb
hanging from its electrical wiring illuminates the foyer and staircase,
casting faint shadows across your vision.

Benson Project, 2nd Floor~
After negotiating the poorly kept staircase, you find yourself in a short
hallway, dimly lit by small imitation candle bulbs that rest in cheap, brass
sconces.  Your feet tread lightly on a ratty looking, olive-green carpet
that is trimmed with a grotesque yellow fringe.  On either side of the
hallway is a think oaken door, knob and handle long gone.  A painting hangs
on the wall here, a sick looking spattering of paint and venin.

Benson Project, 2nd Floor~
The hallway here reeks of body feces and other distasteful fluids.  The
decadence of the scene is completed by the complete erosion of carpet and
the existence of putrid, pink slime that drips slowly down from the ceiling.
An eaten through door stands to either side of you here, the knob and
locking mechanism long ago torn out and with all likelihood, sold.  The
small window at the end of the hallway has been taped over with a thick
veneer of a semi-viscous material, almost impossible to get off.

A Room in Benson Project~
As soon as you enter this room, you are assailed by the disgusting stench
of feces and rotting food.  In the corner of the room, you see the decaying
remains of a Benson Project citizen.  The man's jeans have long since had
their label eaten off by insects, and his leather jacket, worn with use,
barely covers his skeletal bones.  His face crawls with maggots, as do his
partly chewed ribs.

A Room in Benson Project~
You stand in a totally abandoned room, tiny by any standards.  A person
would be lucky to fit a single bed, and dresser, in addition to the sink and
cabinets that line the west wall.  Like out in the hallway, the single
window has been glazed over, making it impossible to see what lies beyond. 
A sheen of dust covers the room, telling you that nobody has been here for
quite some time.

A vegetable store~
This store has long since been worked over by the hands of time, dust
collects on some of the fruit and vegetables, to mention nothing of the
massive amounts of mold and mildew collecting in the corners of the room.  A
sticky, brownish colored counter rests on the east wall, a collection of
pots and pans hang from hooks behind the counter.  You see a small grey door
that bars the way to the south, for some reason, it appears slightly newer
than the rest of the store.

Backroom of a vegetable store~
The light from the street filters through the settling dust in the front
room and barely illuminates the skanky walls that surround you.  Spots of
mold and mildew hang themselves from the wooden planks of the walls, lending
you their odor and mustiness.  A small ladder has been placed up against the
south wall that climbs gradually up and into a dark square hole in the
ceiling.

A darkened storeroom~
The ladder places you in stern darkness that occludes your sight.  And if
you would believe your imagination, you could almost think that it blocks
your senses of hearing and smell as well.  In any case, the light that you
carry gently illuminates this room and reveals it as the storeroom that it
is.  Steel crates sealed with titanium buckles lie about the room, as well
as older looking wooden chests.  Small strips of tissue paper hang from the
beams in the store room, rustling in the convection currents wafting about.

Rory's Skatin Wheels n Other Stuff~
You stand in a wild emporium of various items necessary to the hardcore
skater, whether they are using wheels, hummingbirds, or the latest
retractable spoke technology.  A variety of boards hangs from the walls and
ceilings, as well as do the latest in 'pooning technology.  All sorts of
colors and designs are available, matching the crazy tie die paint motif of
the store itself.  The smell of incense completes the rather odd assault on
your senses.

A Pastry Shop~
You stand in a quaint little pastry shop, the walls patterned with a cute
red and white holographic checkered design.  The 3-dimensional cubes of the
design make you a bit dizzy at first, but as you become accustomed to the
sensation, it makes the bakery seem larger than it really is.  A small glass
display case has samples of pastries and deserts already set out for you,
very rich and fattening looking.  A single small round table has been set up
in the corner of the pastry shop, covered with a matching red and white
checkered tablecloth.  A crystalline decanter/vase filled with a boquet of
tempests completes the ambience.

A dentist's office~
You stand in a filthy roomwith tiled green and white walls that are caked
with mildew and mold.  In the center of the room is a padded olive green
chair that has been duct taped over to hide its rips and tears.  A single
swivel lamp is attached to the east wall, and has been positioned directly
over the reclining chair.  A folding table in one corner of the room holds a
number of rusty looking utensils (no self serving person would dare call
them surgical instruments) and cloths.  A grotesque and cracked sink appears
to be the source of sterilization in this room, the water dripping from its
spicket brown with rot.

Cafe Limbo~
You have walked into a small, smoke filled room that is so darkened that
it is difficult to see.  What you can make out is that the cafe has been
decorated in a perdominantly purple and gold motif, with various holographic
paintings completing the image.  People sit quietly sipping at their cacao
and whispering in hushed tones, hunched over small round tables that are big
enough to eat at, yet small enough to lean over and give the occasional
peck.  A pair of couches made from Dacra(tm) that stand against the north
wall offer a more relaxed and sublime setting for the cafe's patrons.

System Modeling and Design~
You stand in a room that appears to be dominated by both the scholar and
the engineer.  Bookshelves line the walls, crafted from some beautiful
mahogany that must have been imported from somewhere other than the Sprawl. 
It is hard to read the titles from where you stand but a few catch your eye.
`iCHAOS`l, another one reads "The `iSlinky`l", and yet another reads
"`iLaPlace`l Transformations".  They do not look like easy reading, but a
comfortable looking spot has been cleared out at a table that you could sit
at.

Inside a Policeman's Booth~
You stand inside a Policeman's Booth, and it is not nearly exciting as
you thought it might be.  No panels of lights or flashing display monitors,
just a single `ieyepiece`l connected to a wire that runs underneath the
thin, CTX countertop.  Other than that, the close proximity of the booth's
walls makes you feel somewhat entrapped, and you wonder if being in this
booth is any safety at all.

eyepiece~
As you fit the eyepiece to your eye, you feel yourself being patched into
some sort of computer network.  Binary bit streams fly by your face and
flash tid bits of multimedia code.  Suddenly, you find yourself staring at a
massive flashing menu, overwritten by a blinking red sign that reads
`q"ENTER METAVERSE:"`l to continue.

XTC Foods~
You stand in small, spherical shaped room that spins lazily in your
sight.  You can see the entrance to the store appear and disappear
periodically, coinciding with the motion of the store itself.  On the far
wall of the store is a massive adamantite counter, electrolyzed with silver,
in order to remove the smell of the hard metal.  However, what dominates the
picture is the amazing variety of exotic foods that is hanging from the
walls and carefully stashed around the room.  Williberries, tungst, briar
root, silicon chews, and aardvark blood are just a few of the delicacies.

Greater Burger Kingdom, Drive-Through~
You are at the entrance to the Greater Burger Kingdom, a small slice of
pavement that has been painted orange and yellow with a laser coating device
that is both expensive andbad for the environment.  In all, its pretty damn
gaudy, as you wait in line to place your order and get your food.  A big
smily face beams at you, another ugly holographic image that this franchise
has put up in order to attract their target market, kids, YUCK!

Greater Burger Kingdom~
You are before the payment window of the Greater Burger Kingdom
drive-through service.  A small slot that is lined with blinking green and
red `iLED`l's indicates the place where you are supposed to put your credit
file.  Food looks like it will be dispensed froma flap covered hole just to
the right of the credit slot.  Other than those two things, you cannot see
much else.  A wall separates you from the manufacturing processes that go on
inside, and a glass shield window appears to have been glossed over with a
metallic paint, making it opaque.  In any case, an arrow points you the way
out, since you can't go back the way you came in.  (Type `kEXIT

This room is cluttered with a wide assortment of graph paper and colored

what seems to be a map of some sort.  In fact, the square marked with a

Intersection of Carnation and 61st~
You stand at the corner of two busy thoroughfares, traffic flow directed
by a small, rusty looking yellow box suspended over the center of the
intersection by high tension cables.  61st Street runs off to the east, an
almost perfectly straight avenue that for the most part, is lined with
stores and other typical "city" things.  Piles of rubble lie both to the
north and west, as if the road once extended further, but has been collapsed
and destroyed through some event in the past.

61st Street runs to the east and west here, the northernmost vestige of
the old city streets that managed to survive the advances of nature and the
cataclysms of the past.  And as you look around at the rubble and dust
settling over the street, you begin to get a sense of just how old this
street is.  Random tin garbage cans are strewn across the entrance to a
rickety looking building just to the south.  A sign hangs over the doorway
that reads "`nBenson Project`l".

61st Street~
You stand on a dusty looking street here, the paint marking its dividing
line and sidelines cracked and chipped off the asphalt that it once resided
on.  Buildings line the street to the south, mostly run down residential
looking structures.  A small grocery store has been set up to the south
here, its entrance little more than a darkened hole in the wall.  You can
see rotting vegetables and sordid meat through the large bulletproof
`i`mwindow`l`l at the building's front.  The structure runs upwards three
stories, although the upper windows are clouded, cracked, and taped up.

61st Street~
61st Street rolls not so gently off to the east and west here, a collage
of concrete destruction and other randomly strewn debris.  You find the
footing actually quite treacherous here as potholes and the scars from
recently exploded mines tickle your feet.  A large bluff of sand and twisted
steel bars the way north, making this one of the northernmost parts of the
entire city.  An argon `i`kstreetlight`l`l periodically illuminates the
street with its crackling orange light, flickering on and off seemingly at
its own whim.

Intersection of Truit and 61st~
Two streets merge here at a classically architected right angle.  The
street that runs off the south is paved much more cleanly, and seems to have
less of the apparent decadence that exists on 61st Street.  A small green
`i`jsign`l`l made from worked titanium has the words painted on it "Truit
Street".  61st Street continues off to the east and west here as well.

The raggedness of 61st Street continues both to the east and west here, a
rambling avenue of overturned garbage cans, wrecked vehicles, and despondent
looking homes and buildings.  The way to the north is blocked off by a tall
bluff constructed of interleaved sand and steel beams.  But the thing that
dominates your vision is a blazing pink neon sign that hangs approximately
two man heights off the ground.  It reads in vulgar curly script "`uPlatina's
Delectable Bitch Whores. `mFor Your Dining Pleasure!`l"  A `iposter`l of a 
naked woman with bulging breasts taped to the front door leaves little
to your imagination about what this building is all about.

with two ancient revolver from the twentieth century.  The poster is

61st Street~
You stand on a road littered with various scraps of metal and other
scattered debris.  Just from the sight and smell of the area, you can tell
that you are in one of the more run down sections of the Sprawl.  Off in the
short distance, you can hear the occasional sniper fire into the street.  It
almost makes you duck through the thick steel sliding door that stands ajar
just to the south.  It leads into a nondescript looking three story building
constructed of age old brownstone frames.  61st Street continues off to the
east and west here.

down slum claws across the northernmost reach of the Sprawl.  You are uneasy
as you walk carefully though the scattered garbage and debris on the ground,
since you are fairly certain that you are being watched in one capacity or
another.  One such hiding place could be the shattered building that stands
off to the south.  It almost looks as if a bomb landed on its roof, and
subsequently tore it apart.

Intersection of Rose and 61st~
You stand at the crossing between two streets, one running north-south,
the other east-west.  The signs that used to grace the four corners of the
intersection have been torn down by vandals, and true to 61st Street form, a
wide variety of garbage has been strewn across the intersection.  Rose
Avenue looks slightly more habitable, cleaner if not safer.  In any case,
you feel very exposed here as you hear sniper fire go off again.

61st Street stretches off both to the east and west here, a dusty tribute
to the grand size of the Sprawl itself.  The north has been blocked off all
along the street by a high bluff of dusty sand, rock, and steel girders.  It
is almost as if the city has built this to defend itself from the unknown
elements that rage outside the outer limits.  The street itself is unkempt
and the buildings that line its perimeter are run down and rather filthy
looking.  A wall size bulletin `iboard`l has been hammered crudely to the
wall of a building to the south and sports a number of freshly put up
posters.

61st Street~
You stand in one section of 61st Street, the northernmost reach of the
Sprawl.  It is difficult to get your footing here, because of all the
debris, shell casings, and yes, the occasional corpse.  Intermittent sniper
fire cracks through the air, occasional wafts of acrid air mingling with the
odor of rotting refuse and feces.  A `kstreetlight`l formerly illuminated
this area of the street, but now stands lifeless, as either the long lasting
argon bulb has lived its due course, or it has been shot out by vandals and
thieves.

Intersection of Aster and 61st~
You stand at the intersection of 61st Street and a much thinner street
that runs off to the south.  Glancing up at the small titanium green sign,
(trimmed in white of course), you discover that this is Aster Avenue. 
Despite the sand blowing in your face and the rather obvious decay of the
buildings that you have seen on 61st Street, Aster Avenue's darkness sends
shivers down your spine.  Drapes of laundry hang from rusty fire escapes and
once in a while, you catch a person ducking back inside after having
examined you.

in from the tall sandy bluff that bars the way north.  Slummy looking
buildings line the street, and grafiti and other random posters and hangings
grace the building walls.  Off to the east, you can see where construction
was halted on a building, the yellow Caterpillar moving crane now rusted
with disuse.

Just to the south here, a building was under construction, but for one
reason or another, abandoned.  The first floor looks as if it were almost
completed, as the steel girder foundation and earthquake damping system has
already been laid down.  A massive steel `kcrane`l, Caterpillar Model 570
has been left here, a rusty hulk of faded yellow steel, a mute testimony to
the general decay of this area of the Sprawl.  Hunks of rock and engineered
silly putty building material lie strewn across the southern half of the
street.  It is almost as if what were once neat piles of materials have been
searched through and discarded.

Intersection of Lily and 61st~
Lily Avenue branches off the south here, a thin meandering road that does
not look as if it offers much in the way of legal commerce.  One of the few
traffic lights you have seen governs traffic here, suspended from high
tension cables at the middle of the intersection.  You can hear the random
clickings of the microprocessors inside the switch boxes, then you realize
that the lights are not working at all.  With that bit of negative
reassurance, you take in the rest of the intersection.  At the corners of
buildings here, you can see the stray bullet marks that have been left from
recent crossfire.  On that note, you decide to get moving.

61st Street continues its journey across the breadth of the Sprawl here. 
The pavement is cracked with the wear of the years, it seems that nobody has
taken the time and effort necessary to maintain the integrity of the road. 
Similarly, the buildings here have been allowed to go to ruin.  Shingles
hang loosely from poorly constructed gutters, rust spots almost everything
you see, and garbage has been heaped everywhere.  The sheer "oldness" of
this part of the city stuns you, it is difficult to even imagine a world
where people still used combustible engines and rubber birth control.

You stand on yet another one of the sections of 61st Street, this wavy ,
curvy, topsy turvy, mutated, decadent, run down piece of hellhole rumproast
crap section of the Sprawl.  And if that wasn't descriptive enough for you,
there are plenty of ugly looking, chafed brownstone buildings to the south
here that look as if they have not been habitated for quite some time.  The
entire scene is pretty depressing, the crackling of sporadic gunfire does
little to help the matter either.

Just off to the south here, you see a thin glass doorway framed with
cheap aluminum girders.  A massive neon sign above the door flashes
"`vRory's Skatin Wheels n Other Stuff`l", the pulses reflected dimly by the
bulletproof glass of the store itself.  Garbage is strewn across the front
of the store, as well as around the width of 61st Street.  The sunlight
streaking in from over your shoulder does little to beautify the street, as
it only serves to emphasize the squalor that 61st street has become.

There is only one thing that passes through your mind as you walk slowly
down the uneven and cracked asphalt paving, this street is chaos.  Garbage
and homeless people lie strewn across the way, adding their stench to the
already rather repugnant odor of the sandy bluff to the north.  Decaying and
gutted buildings sit like shadows of a long dead past, silent reminders that
not everything man creates is created in brilliance, or even with
intelligence.

61st Street continues off to the east and west here, a thoroughfare of
utter and complete anarchy.  The pavement is so cracked, that it has almost
ceased to be pavement, instead reduced to the gravel from which it came.  A
rat warren of buildings sits to the south, and if you search carefully
enough, you can see the resentful stare of people staring out the
`i`iwindows`l.  You don't seem to see any way into the warren from this
point, so you may as well move on.

As you stare intently into the smoky bulletproof windows, you are shocked
to see what appears to be a massive assembly line diligently at work. 
Despondent looking workers wearing thin, light blue, latex gloves seem to be
placing small colored objects into baggies, as well as occasionally
retrieving large sheets of paper from a bubbling red vat.  Large, caged
lamps illuminate the room, and men with square rifles pace leisurely about. 
When a man with a transceiver strapped about his head looks up at you, you
decide its time to go.

You stand on a portion of the street that is decorated with numerous

they have been here for a long time, and represent obsolete products and

Intersection of Orange and 61st~
61st Street runs into an intersection here with Orange Avenue, the
easternmost street of the central Sprawl.  Both to the north and the west, a
sandy bluff supported by steel girders works in combination to keep the
elements of the outerworld at bay.  Off to the southwest, you see the warren
of twisting alleyes and alcoves in between a series of buildings again.  And
you see those eys watching you again, waiting for your next move.

Carnation Avenue~
Carnation Avenue runs north and south here, tall buildings arranged
neatly on either side of it.  They do not appear to be in very good shape,
as shingles hang loosely from decaying roof paste, and the kevlar coated
windows are laced with spidery cracks.  The road itself seems almost springy
to the step, and as you examine closely, you notice that pieces of striated
rubber have been inlaid into the asphalt, giving it a chameleonesque
texture.  Off to the north a short ways, you can see where Carnation Avenue
intersects with another street.

Truit Street~
Truit Street at closer examination is more like 61st Street than one
would have guessed.  Leftover jeyhey compression needles have been discarded
here, their hallucinogenic contents already consumed by a lucky customer. 
In addition, garbage and other "human refuse" lies in heaps in this thin
street.  It hardly seems as if any vehicular traffic could fit in this
alleyway, and the predominance of pedestrians tells you that your instincts
were correct.  A fire escape has been carelessly left down on the building
to the east of you here, allowing you to scale its greenstone walls.

Rose Avenue~
Rose Avenue runs north and south here, 61st Street lies just to the
north.  The previously gravelly pavement has been rolled over and
primitavely tarred here, the points of the longer rocks still jutting out of
the cool, rubbery surface.  The lines haven't even been repainted on the
road yet, leaving you wondering how traffic passes through this seemingly
three lane road.  Small buildings that line the street are dwarfed by the
taller ones that you see stretching up into the sky to the south, east and
west.  A broken cylindrical tube gutter has been torn from its moorings
here, and hangs across the window ledges of two buildings.

Aster Avenue~
You carefully pick your way down the northern end of Aster Avenue, and
already you get the impression that this is a seething pit of two-legged
vipers, out to stab you or shoot you, or vaporize you, or explode your head
like an overripe canteloupe.  The walls of slummy buildings climbs up your
shoulders on either side, the dirty laundry hanging from fire escapes hiding
the prying eyes that you know are watching you.  Overturned garbage cans,
and the fact that it is very dark on this street make it difficult to walk
down this alley, making you think that maybe this wasn't such a great idea.

Lily Avenue~
Lily Avenue is a thin strip of gravel that crunches delicatately under
your feet as you tread over it.  The buildings on this street appear to be
all boarded up and in a steady state of disuse.  The discarded casings of a
variety of drugs are strewn across the way.  A massive steel garbage
depository has been upended here as well, adding yet another element to the
disorderly feel to the entire street.

Orange Avenue~
Orange Avenue runs away from 61st Street to the north here, away from the
horrible decadence and corruption that has managed to seize the heart and
mind of the northern Sprawl.  You see some of the first signs of vibrant
life here, as shops and buildings seem to have a freer feel about them, a
certain confidence in their environment.  Orange Avenue continues off the
the south, three lane down well paved to accomodated both automobiles and
hovercraft.

wooden door stands closed.  Above it is a thin rosewood placard that reads
"Bathwind Homes".  You are not sure what type of business they entertain
inside there, but the entire building emits a subtle evil feeling steam
which clouds up the windows of the 2 story building.

Truit Street~
The filthy alleyway known as Truit Street careens about the piles of dung
and refuse that have magically collected here.  Among the hundred of shoddy
wooden doors that swing open on shoddier brass hinges, you see one door that
sticks out in your mind.  It looks to be composed of corrugated steel, and
laminated with combinant rocket armor, a very expensive door indeed.  The
facade of the building really gives you no clue to what lies beyond, as it
is just like any other scum building you have seen here in the northern
Sprawl.

Rose Avenue~
This freshly paved road is aligned north and south, and lined with short,
stocky buildings that are constructed from what appears to be the cheapest
alloys available.  Stray bullets have punctured the building door nearest to
you, leaving a mushrooming hole in the flimsy material.  You catch the scent
of stray garbage, or was that your body odor?  You know the sniper fire you
hear is certainly making you nervous enough to sweat buckets.

those history buffs out there, it used to be called 'brick') A collection of
overturned and half crushed vegetable crates has been left here, offering a
temporary respite from the sniper fire you can hear cracking across the
northern Sprawl.  (Type `iENTER CRATE`l to goto safety)

Lily Avenue~
The thin meandering street of gravel continues to the north and south
here, weaving its way through boarded up high rise buildings.  As you look
around you, you come to the conclusion that there is absolutely no commerce
of the legal type that goes on here.  In fact, you cannot even see how
residents would get into the buildings that line this street.  In any case,
the close proximity of the buildings makes you feel uneasy, and you decide
to move on.

Orange Avenue~
You stand on Orange Avenue, one of the easternmost roads of this Sprawl
establishment.  You see a variety of moderneqsue advertisements here,
selling everything from guns to the leading commodity of the day,
information.  A particular `idatacard`l catches your eye, saying something
about the municipal library.  The perfectly paved street continues both to
the north and south, stuck here in between 61st and 62nd streets.  The
buildings that frame the street are relatively nicely made, yet their
Crysanium sidings are seeing the passage of time and the influence of the
society on 61st Street.

Carnation Avenue~
Carnation Avenue runs to the south here, a wide thoroughfare that
illicits a multitude of traffic, mostly south towards center city you
notice.  The buildings that line the street are well kept for the most part,
a collection of homes and businesses that try to keep the slums of 61st
street and the northern Sprawl at bay.  To the east, a small bakery smelling
up chambray tortes and lemon chiffon has been set up.

Truit Street~
A short ways off to the south, Truit Street is intersected by 62nd
Street, a sight for sore eyes to say the least.  The looming of the tall
buildings that reach up on either side of you leaves you with a cramped
feeling of nausea and profound discontent.  It is not only the physical
walls themselves, but also the decadence that the people here live in.  How
sad, how corrupt, you feel you should help but you can only run, run!

Rose Avenue~
You are not sure about this section of Rose Avenue.  It seems like any
other section of road you have ever been on, in any other section of the
Sprawl, in this life or the last, in this eon, or in another.  It's
impossible to tell sometimes where you find yourself, on a lonely stretch of
road that could have taken itself out of any storybook and set itself under
your feet.  The buildings are of the generic type, uncultural,
not-so-flashy, and a melting pot of experiences from around everywhere.  Oh
yeah, 62nd Street is to the south of here.

Aster Avenue~
You stand almost at the end of the darkness of Aster Avenue, 62nd Street
opening up a short ways off to the south.  However, between you and safety
is a stretch of fifty yards across completely barren, uneven road (that is,
if you are discounting the bullet ridden and disected corpses).  You can see
the fire escape landings where potential snipers can shoot from, and wonder
what you can do to leave Aster Avenue alive.  A door to the east here offers
you some hope, it stands slightly ajar and seems to invite dependency and
security.

Lily Avenue~
A circle of steel oil drums has been set up here as some kind of meeting
place for the commerce that goes on here.  You wonder why they would select
anything that looked so obvious, but it is evident that the businessmen do
not care where they ply their trade, the law does not reach up into the
northern Sprawl.  The circle of drums takes up abot half of the roughly
paved street, which isn't saying a whoel lot, the road is the size of the
average alleyway.

Orange Avenue~
You stand just north of 62nd Street on Orange Avenue here.  A small brick
building to your west catches your eye, an establishment smelling of freshly
baked bread and quaintly decorated with satiny drapes tied back with small
pieces of ribbon.  It is amazing that something this rural could exist here
in the Sprawl, given the conditions of the surrounding neighborhood.  (Look
up `iSal's`l in the Library for background info) The road of Orange Avenue
itself is paved nicely here, the delineating lines clearly painted and
freshly laid down.  Nevertheless, you see some stray bullet marks that have
been painted over in the futile attempt to restore beauty to the Sprawl.

Intersection of Carnation and 62nd~
Carnation Avenue intersects with 62nd Street here, traffic guided by a
modernized holographic policeman who hovers over the center of the
intersection.  His broad smile and plastic-like face tend to make you wonder
where he is being projected from.  In any case, traffic is fairly light here
anyway, as the passage of hovercraft and other vehicles prefer the speed
constraintless venue of the freeway.  Buildings stand on each of the four
corners, mutely rising up above you in homage to the immensity of the
Sprawl.

62nd Street~
62nd Street runs off to the east and west here, a wide and busy
thoroughfare that has been freshly paved over with the latest in latex road
technology.  The road is springy and squishes under your feet.  If you were
driving in a car, the road would depress under your tires, offering you a
greater surface area for your tires.  But in any case, the street is lined
with tall buildings, office structures and residential buildings alike. 
Just to the north is a small cafe with the words `n"Cafe Limbo"`l stenciled
on its pastel tinted front `iwindow`l.

62nd Street~
62nd Street runs across the grain of the Sprawl here, slicing completely
through the city from Carnation Avenue to Orange Avenue.  Along the way, you
see many cute and esoteric buildings you might want to walk into.  One such
just happens to be south of here.  A sign hangs over a keystone archway
which reads `n"System Modeling and Design, by JP"`l You're not sure what the
hell it is talking about, but the scholarly air of the building seems
interesting.

62nd Street~
The hustle and bustle of 62nd Street doesn't affect you all that much, as
it is probably no busier than any other section of the Sprawl.  A clear
policeman's booth adds a bit to your feeling of security, its bulletproof
glass gleaming in the midday sun.  It is perfectly cylindrical with a small
red keypad that gains access to the booth.  A small blue siren on top of the
booth adds a nice touch.  (Type `iENTER BOOTH`l to check it out)

Intersection of Truit and 62nd~
As you walk down 62nd Street here, you notice its intersection with a
think alleyway that is bisected by thr thoroughfare.  The city planners (Was
this mess of a city ever planned?)  Obviously did not deem it worthy enough
to warrant the placing of a holographic `ipoliceman`l here.  However, you do
see that chain link fences are suspended over the entrances of the alleyway,
both to the north and south.  They are suspended on thin wires that run up
the sides of two office supply buildingss.  They look as if they can be
dropped at a moment's notice.  62nd Street itself continues off to both the
east and west here as well.

He looks like the prototypical perfect male.  Face seemingly chiseled out

his neat chin.  His short hair is swept straight back across his head, and a
strange colored hair it is.  It is neither brown, nor blonde, nor any color
in between.  It is no color and all colors at once.  His uniform is a
perfectly starched deep red, demanding and forceful at the same time.

62nd Street~
You continue down the sidewalk of 62nd Street, carefully observing the
going ons about you and the stores and other buildings that have sprouted up
here.  It somehow escaped your notice before, but the street is lined with
massive flourescent bulbs that have been implanted into the squishy surface
of the road.  They provide both guidings for which to drive by, and
illumination during the darker hours.  You have to travel underneath an
`ioverpass`l here, it looks like a skywalk in between two buildings made
almost entirely of glassteel.  A few signs have been appended to the
overpass, one reads "Flower Day, Only 2 Days Away!"  Another reads a bit
more crassly, "Julie and Me, Sittin in a Tree, F-U-C-*-*-N-G".

overpass, too small to read from this vantage point.

You walk the beat here, down a tastefully made up street that is paved
with the newest polymer structured road surface.  The contact patches with
your feet grow as each step you take squishes the road down a foot or so. 
It looks as if someone has actually tried to plant trees in this section of
the Sprawl, although the project does not seem to be going too well. 
Buildings, both new and old, line the street, inviting you inside their
gleaming walls.

62nd Street continues its traverse across the width of the Sprawl here,
its sleek, black surface rippling with the passage of cars and pedestrians. 
A few bits and pieces of garbage lie here and there, but most of it has been
caught by the mobile garbage unit that roves the street.  A small building
to the north of here catches your eye.  The door seems to be made out of
solid brick, and swings open on invisible hinges.  A sign reads "`nPolymer`l
`nSoftware`l" that hangs directly above the door.  The building is four
stories tall, but the top three seem to have been boarded up and closed off.

Intersection of Rose and 62nd~
You stand at the intersection of Rose and 62nd Street, a funny little
crossroads here in the northern Sprawl.  The intersection itself is paved
much like the four lane 62nd Street in that it is a pitch black that
depresses under each of your feet.  In this day of almost unlimited energy
sources, it helps vehicles and pedestrians alike to start and stop faster. 
In any case, Rose Avenue is paved differently, a tumbling streak of grey
gravel granite that seems to stumble onto 62nd Street rather than actually
meet it.  To the north it looks pretty scary on Rose Avenue, to the south,
admittedly, it doesn't look a whole lot better.

You continue down 62nd Street, desensitized by now to the novelty of the
striated polymer traction surface of the street itself.  Instead, you find
yourself marveling at the wide multitude of shops and homes that exist on
this street.  Although the neighborhood does not look like one of the more
affluent places you have been, it is nevertheless clean and somewhat well
kempt.  High above you, barely visible from this angle, you see the
holographic billboard `iprojections`l that were made popular in the 20's. 
The advertised products cannot be seen from here, but from the stopping
aircraft up above, you can see that they still get noticed.

flashes and morphs into itself and into other things.

62nd Street~
Shuttles scuttle to and fro here, taking people from one end of the
Sprawl to another.  They follow a different track than do normal vehicles
do, as those vehicles tend to follow the central black pavement that has
been laid down here on 62nd Street.  For some reason or another, the street
begins to enter a skeletal ribcage like tunnel here, hanging tube lamps
illuminating the roadway inside.  Hanging over the entrance of the tunnel is
a sign that reads `n"Grant's Tunnel".  `lWhich pretty much explains what
this tunnel is called.  Standing here at the edge of the tunnel, you can see
stray specks of light seeping in through the cracks of the tunnel's ribs,
although as you look deeper into the tunnel, the ribs constrict, making the
shadows more evident.

Intersection of Aster and 62nd~
The ribs of the massive tunnel that has been constructed on 62nd Street
here part both to the north and south, giving you access to a small, think
road called Aster Avenue.  Small neon blue lamp projections light the way in
all three directions.  The tunnel continues off to the east, where you can
see the ribs of the structure get closer together, and the corresponding
reduction in lighting.

and multiplies as their sound wave peaks meet and add.  There isn't much

construct.  It is not until you see the `i"Air Traffic Above, Noise
Caution"`l sign that you realize just what all the ruckus was about.  Blue
neon lights direct traffic forward and out the tunnel a short way ahead. 
Interestingly enough, the 62nd Street is made of a different material here
under the tunnel, its something of a more sandy texture, perhaps to
compensate for the occasional splashes of water that falls from the tunnel's
ceiling.

Intersection of Lily and 62nd~
You stand at the intersection of Lily Avenue and 62nd Street, a
crossroads that doesn't really seem to fit together.  Lily Avenue seemes
rife with poverty and destitution, with its hanging laundry lines, and
grafiti ridden building walls.  On the other hand, 62nd Street appears to be
pretty well off, with relatively clean buildings, and a modern pavement that
stretches and yawns beneath your feet.  Trying to reconcile this
intersection is like trying to fit together those jigsaw puzzle pieces that
you just KNOW go together, but dammit, they just won't fit.

62nd Street~
You continue your way down 62nd Street here, marching up and down on the
polymer bound road surface that stretches and squishes underneath your feet.
Thick, flourescent white lamps have been embedded on either side of the road
here, providing illumination at night, and guiding lights during the day. 
It looks as if some organization has started to plant flowers or some other
type of sentient organism next to those guiding lights, but they are dying
of neglect, and more importantly, lack of water.

62nd Street~
A number of different shops line the street here, offering you a wide
variety of things to see and experience.  Just to the north is a building
that is selling various types of Valencium computer chips and other
accessories.  Just to the south of here is a small grocery store that sells
exotic goods to upper class passer bys.  62nd Street continues off both to
the east and west.  Although a short ways off to the west, you see that the
road dives into a massive ribbed tunnel and disappears from view.

62nd Street~
Unlike what you have seen on 62nd Street before, this part of the road
appears somewhat run down and deprived.  The street is the same advanced,
high tech, contact patch increasing, black line polymer, but the buildings
to the north coalesce into a `iwarren`l of crumbling structures, seemingly
lashed together with a multitude of laundry lines, clothes, and
miscellaneous cables.  You can feel the telltale eyes of people watching you
from some of those northern windows, and it makes you feel curious and
afraid at the same time.  Unfortunately, there doesn't seem to be any way
into the complex, especially if you want to go in unnoticed.

62nd Street~
62nd Street continues off to the east and west here, running by a number
of shops and residences on the south, and a massive maze of corrupted and
decaying buildings to the north.  As you stop to examine the not-so-pristine
surroundings, you feel the cold stare of eyes upon you.  As you look up, you
notice the flicker of motion from one of the buildings to the north, inside
the rat warren of garbage and discarded hyper needles.  Before you even
think of venturing there, perhaps you would be best served by stopping in
the store to the south, "`nFlak Jacks`l".

62nd Street~
Somehow, you being to get that feeling that you are being watched.  The
intrusive sensation dominates any of your other senses at the moment,
leaving you unable to fully comprehend your surroundings.  But what you DO
notice, is that there are several people staring at you from the tangle of
old and "abandoned" buildings to the north.  Your eye is attracted by the
copious amount of dust red slime coating the buildings' walls, and the
steady drip of chemical compound `iSXV-20`l that steams up as it hits the
ground from its starting place high above the street.  In all, your mind
senses gradients, the difference between the garbage to the north, and the
relative calm to the south.

sxv-20~
This chemical compound is slightly viscous, a derivative of the highly
corrosive MNT "thin water" that was used prevalently in the 40's.  The
SXV-20 is cooler to the touch, and has been made safe for a human's skin. 
Its imary uses these days is the creation of stand alone structureless
ladders and building sidings.

62nd Street~
You stand near the intersection of 62nd and Orange Avenue, and as you
look north, you wonder what the hell has happened here.  Common word was
that 62nd Street was a nice neighborhood, but judging from the tangle of
crusty red and mortar buildings to the north, this place smells like five
day old toe cheese.  Nevertheless, this looks like it has some promise in
the development aspect, as the road itself is freshly paved with the newest
shock damping technologies, and the roadside is brightly lit with
flourescent white lamps embedded firectly into the dark roading.

Intersection of Orange and 62nd~
This is the corner of Orange Avenue and 62nd Street, a congested loophole
in the Sprawl that desperately needs an additional HolotrafficCop to direct
the flow of both pedestrians and vehicles.  Orange Avenue extends off to the
north and south here, probably most distinguishable by the slowly rocking
fern fronds that sprout up from either side of the road.  A small green road
sign tells you the names of both intersecting roads, just in case you
weren't reading carefully a little bit earlier.

Carnation Avenue~
Carnation Avenue runs away and to the south from 62nd Street here.  You
notice that as the farther you have gone south, the better built and more
attractive the buildings and the street itself is.  Although the road is
made of the same straited, vulcanized surface as before, the lighting here
is provided by glareless photon emitters that project a computerized image
of the road directly into the cerebral cortex, in other words, there really
is no light.  The buildings here seem to have a higher and higher percentage
of glass built into them, making them seem more frail and beautiful at the
same time.

You stand on a thin slip of a street, loosely paved, and barely passable
by those vehicles dependant on air cushion technology.  Street lamps that
have been placed by the roadside strain to light at all, their sickly yellow
glow making the dirtiness of this street all the more evident.  To the west
of here, a small vertical sliding door stand open, the sky blue paint on its
surface chipping and fraying.  A simple enough sign stands above the
entrance that reads "Sanitation Department".

Aster Avenue~
Aster Avenue leads directly to 62nd Street to the north here, snaking its
way in between a few standard looking buildings that have bullet marks on
them.  That just might show you what sort of neighborhood Aster Avenue is. 
But of course, this is South Aster, where the sniper fire is not as
prevalent, where the girls are a tad bit prettier, where the human feces
doesn't stick so much when you step in it.  Nevertheless, you are snapped
from your reverie by the all too close and familiar sound of an old
fashioned buck shotgun being fired.

South Lily Avenue~
It is an odd sight, but South Lily bears almost no resemblance to its
sister north of 62nd Street.  The way is actually clean here, and instead of
the huddled masses of drug addicts and sex fiends that you might find
further north, you see well kept shops, and more importantly, lights where
portal policemen can make rapid entries in response to pleas for help.  The
road underneath your feet is still pretty granular and undesirable, but
overall the scene is one of renovation and revitalization.

The leafy bordered fern heaven of Orange Avenue continues both to the
north and south here, intersecting with 62nd Street a short ways off to the
north.  Just to the west of here, you see a massive set of double doors that
hinge tightly on massive adamantite pinions.  A shield of glass protects the
front of the building, you can only assumore that it is constructed from
some type of bulletproof material.  As you examine the building more
closely, you see the sign that says `n"Kodiak Cash"`l.  After a few more
moments of relative stupor, you realize that this two storied block of
herniatite is in fact a bank.

The computer generated image that you can feel feeding into your brain
becomes a bit unsettling after a while, an experienced hacker could probably
feel the bit stream flowing into his brain, a virtual flood of ones and
zeroes.  Somehow the road and surroundings seem like they are tinted in an
odd shape of green, which then suddenly disappears and snaps back into a
frame of perfect color.  Perhaps the error correction scheme on the system
is faulty.

South Truit Street~
Truit "Street" continues its meager journey north and south here, a
rather dirty and excruciatingly cramped alleyway that would probably serve
everyone in the Sprawl better if it were cordoned off.  Tall buildings rise
both to the east and west, giving the street an even more cramped feeling. 
It smells unusual here, and after some indecision, you decide that it is a
most unsavory mixture of rotting garbage and cheap hormonal perfume.  The
overall effect is one of biting into a delicious apple, only to find it
stuffed with dung.

Aster Avenue~
Aster Avenue runs off to the north and south here, a wafer thin slip of
an alley that stands occluded darkness even in the height of the day.  Some
type of fluid drips slowly down and out of the drainage systems of the
surrounding buildings, leaving the Avenue covered with a thin film of
moisture.  The road here does not seem to have been paved in quite some
time, and you find the surface quite slippery.  You notice that the windows
in this area have been, for the most part, boarded up it makes you wonder
where everyone has gone.

South Lily Avenue~
South Lily Avenue intersects with Marlin Street just a few kilolactrics
south of here.  In stark contrast to what you have seen of Lily Avenue to
the north of 62nd Street, the neighborhood is fairly clean, if lacking in
the technology department.  Small shops and a few residences frame the still
gravelly road, their markerstone facades slightly faded and eroded.  Cute
little drapes hang from some of the windows, giving the scene an ambience of
homeliness and comfort.  Band charged lamps hang suspended over the road
from almost invisible high tension wires, shining their effervescent light
down upon the street.  It's not home, but it's comfortable.

Orange Avenue~
At times, the fern fronds that sprout up along the roadside have become
overgrown and are more of a nuisance than an addition to the street's
ambience.  They brush your face and legs on occasion, tickling and abrading
at the same time.  To the west, you can see the front facade of a large
establishment, two stories high and apparently reinforced with a deep, thick
stone or metal.  The occasional window is on the second story, tightly
barred with a brand new Disraeli alloy.  Off to the east remains an
undeveloped section of the Sprawl, the outer wastes more specifically, a
place where development has regressed, where nature has taken 'civilization'
away from society as we know it.

that somehow cannot shake that artificial feeling about it no matter how

the vulcanized rubber that has been laid in strips across the width of the
street.  The engineering principle behind this is probably a little too
complicated to go into at the moment.  Classy looking buildings line
Carnation Avenue, residences for the most part, although a few scattered and
local businesses ply their trade here.

Intersection of Truit and Marlin~
You stand at the corner of Truit Street and Marlin Street.  As you look
around at Marlin Street, you see that for the most part, it is a completely
residential neighborhood, and brand new, open for development.  A few quaint
houses have sprung up here, modern looking but tastefully done at the same
time.  Double overhead lights extend over the middle of the street, shining
brightly down upon the street at all times.  It is hard to believe, but the
air here actually smells of flowers, maybe that's because rows and rows of
flowers have been planted where prospective tenants might choose to move in.
They match the bushes that have also been planted here for their ascethic
quality.

You stand at the corner of Marlin and McIlhenny, a beautiful and quaint
intersection in the center of what could be called the Sprawl's quiet
residential area.  A row of flowers and ornately carved topiary bushes line
the recently redone street, their colors and vibrant leaves constrast
sharply with the deep blue black of the Vesper(tm) Ceramic road surface. 
Much room for development has been left here, as it appears that this is a
fairly new neighborhood, and still looking for people to expand.

they might be habitable soon, as they are in the process of being
constructed.  Plenty of plots remain available here, a `n"Salmon Realty"`l
sign attests to this fact.

still under development.  Hurry and get your spot!

on the new development of Marlin Street.  It seems to be a quiet area,
complete with shaven topiary bushes and planted flowers that line the
freshly paved street.  Plots of recently razed land hover about the edges of
Marlin Street, almost begging to be built on.  A thin mesh, barely visible
hangs suspended over the entire street, ostensibly to filter out damaging
chemicals that float about the air here.  Conspicously out of place is an
old fashioned steel manhole, tarred over and seemingly stuck.

Intersection of Marlin and Center~
You stand at the intersection of Marlin Street and Center Street, a stark
contrast between a small residential burb, and a main avenue that bisects
the center of the Sprawl.  Center Street is approximately seven vehicle
lanes wide, a massive contruct that seems to be underutilized, as the
traffic is pretty light.  Buildings line Center Street, most of them still
empty, begging to be developed and taken over.  It is similar to Marlin
Street in that respect since Marlin seems to be developing into a strictly
residential zone.  A holographic `ipoliceman`l stands here, directing
traffic.

lit by a combination of double overhead lamps and and sideways oriented
halogens.  There is a vibrant feel to the neighborhood here that you have
not experienced in other parts of the Sprawl.  It is almost as if the
expected expansion of this area has added life and purpose to Marlin Street,
or as much life and purpose a street can have.

existed.  The intersection itself is a compromise between the two diverse
settings, a scarred but still habitable little corner of the Sprawl.

been kicked up into the air.  It is a bit unusual, but grass has been
planted here already, a comforting prelude to any residence you might want
to build here.

of pan flutes and digitally created tonal melodies wafts towards you from
Handy Hills, further enhancing its uniqueness.  Marlin Street on the other
hand looks like a beautiful residential area that has been set up in the pre
development phase.

A tisk, a task, a lumberjack.  A flower, a bush, an ample toosh.  A

willies.  Its a quiet place at least, a funny little place that for once
makes you think of something other than survival in the Sprawl.  If you had
to describe it in one word, you would probably say, "This is a quiet
residential type area."

moment, when you realize that these streets were named by the residents of
the Sprawl thesmelves, which would be YOU.  What a funny place!

Marlin Street~
Have you ever eaten a chunk of cold, chocolate flavored Ex-lax in the
dead of winter while racing buck naked across a frozen river, with the
moonlight streaming through your hair, and wind rippling across your back
like the cool caresses of a goose feather playing softly across your toes? 
Have you ever seen a flower that blooms inwards, folding in on itself, then
rolling outwards, showing its inner colors on the outside?  Well, neither
have most people, and come to think about it, you're not sure why you are
thinking about this while walking down a residential street in the Sprawl.

turn in this residential district of the Sprawl.  After a while, the roads
have gotten to looking similar, or the same.  It's become a bit difficult to
navigate around, you're fortunate that there are small yellow neon
streetsigns placed at each corner of the flower beds and bushes that have
been planted here.

Orange Avenue~
Orange Avenue continues to the south here, a lounging, straight shot
causeway that cuts through what seems to be a fern forest.  Buildings line
the street , mostly commerical in nature.  Some appear modern, some appear
old, some appear just plain confused.  As if the architect thought he was
fooling around with those most ancient of play things, Tinkertoys.  One
building to your west catches your eye in particular, its tilted!  And looks
as if is starting to set in the rock hard foundation.  Impossible yes, but
somehow this architect made it happen.

Carnation Avenue~
A short ways off to the south here, Carnation Avenue intersects with
another street.  It's a little too far to tell the exact street yet.  The
computer rendered image that shows Carnation is a little fuzzier than usual
here, perhaps east transmitter is a bit distant.  In any case, you notice
that a few lonesome shrubs have been planted along the wayside here, looking
very lost and very much anachronistic.  In fact, this is one of the few
places that you have actually seen sod in the Sprawl.  Space is a commodity
here, land is life, area is good.

McIlhenny Street~
McIlhenny Street runs north and south here, a tiny slip of a street that
is completely dominated by houses painted in red and green.  Long ago, this
street was named after the Tabasco king, a somewhat random anecdote in this
modern rat hell known unaffectionately as the Sprawl.  The roof shingles in
the homes here have been laid down and laminated with a permanent plastic
laquer, designed to persevere the hardest wind storms, and even in some
instances, survive a bomb explosion.

Center Street~
Center Street runs north and south here, a massive collonade of asphalt
and vulcanized rubber surfacing that streaks down the center of the
residential burb of the Sprawl.  Massive cannon-like spotlights steer the
way down the pathway, beams of lights that you seem to catch and ride on as
you rush down the builing lined street.  The shops on either side of you
seem to flash by you in an instant, and the more inquisitive among you might
even stop to ask why the hell you're moving so fast!  Slow down hoss! 
There's a speed limit here in the Sprawl believe it or not.

Handy Hills~
As you walk slowly down Handy Hills, you are amazed at the diversity you
see here.  Buildings that look like residences have been spruced up in
decorative chemical glitters, and with resonant paints that hum as you look
at them.  The entire street gives you a "partying" feeling, as if the people
and music on this street do not rest at night, and only occasionally during
the day.  Lights of varying colors hang draped above you across the width of
the street, suspended in between the balconies and awnings of seeral
buildings.  The chatter of people here stems not only from the people who
abound, but from the goldenlocks that flap and squawk on the roofs overhead.

Kendy Avenue~
Kendy Avenue is a short ways south of Marlin Street here, a smaller
tributary that has much the same type of houses, if a bit older in
appearance.  They seem to be fairly well tended though, in some, you can see
that a painstaking effort has been made to maintain a synthetic garden,
complete with anion mixture sod and artificial laser induced pigmentation. 
Sure the tomatoes might taste a bit rubbery, and the turnips taste like
fried pork, but nothing in the Sprawl is what you might have expected.

Orange Avenue~
Orange Avenue runs north and south, a massive street that carries much of
the north south traffic in the Sprawl, independent of the labryinth like
freeway systems that runs somewhere off to the west of the Sprawl.  An
intersection with a small side street is apparent a short ways off to the
south, but not very noteworthy.  The air here has that peculiar tang of
mixed polluted chemicals and artifically scented fern fronds, it might be
pleasant in another city, at another time.

Intersection of Carnation and Lincoln~
Carnation Avenue intersects with Lincoln Street here, which runs calmly
off to the east.  The experimental night computer imaging system that was
implemented on Carnation Avenue seems to have been perfected here, as the
corners of the intersection have nary a dithering scar, and the movement of
images across your field of vision do not show the characteristic blur that
you have seen before.  In any case, Lincoln Street appears to be a business
district by all counts, although you do see a few residences about the area.

Lincoln Street~
Lincoln Street runs into the residential burb of the Sprawl here, first
passing by a few businesses that have been set up here to cater to local
habitants.  To the south is a small building that specializes in old
fashioned tobacco products, a throwback to the 2nd millenium you suppose. 
To the north is a similarly mind altering store, more esoteric and far more
disruptive to human functions than is tobacco.  Despite their seemingly
seedy industries, the shops seem well kept and have an air of
professionalism about them.

Lincoln Street~
Lincoln Street runs to the east and west here, east into the residential
burb district and west onto Carnation Avenue.  The street is lined with
buildings that masquerade as stores, a hodgepodge collection of dwellings
that offer services to the nearby residences.  For some reason or another,
you think you can smell the faint aromas of PineSol(tm) cleaner in the air. 
Maybe it's because of the store to the north, which is hawking its cleaning
supplies and other random sundries.

Lincoln Street~
You stand on Lincoln Street, the connecting corridor between the computer
rendered Carnation Avenue to the west, and the series of roads that makes up
the residential burb to the east.  A peculiar looking shop has been set up
just to the north, the sign that proclaims its purpose is written in a
foreign language, and is pretty damn much unreadable.  The shop itself is
trimmed in red and gold, inlaid with various green and gold gems, probably
fake from the looks of things.  But then again, gems aren't worth a whole
olot anymore, information is everything.

Lincoln Street~
Lincoln Street continues to the east here, intersecting McIlhenny Street
a short ways off.  Shops line the street here, quiet looking buildings that
help to supply the residents of the residential burb that is focused on
Marlin and Media Streets.  A set of bright, cherry red doors stands to the
south, paint somewhat faded with the passage of time, and door kno knocker
swinging loosely on its hinges.  A pair of bold blue glassteel windows rest
just up and to the left and right of the door, a pair of shiny eyes that
completes the ridiculous clown like face that the building resembles.  A
sign hangs in between those two windows, `n"Giggle's"`l, a loose wooden
thaaang that hangs like a pair of loose, wire framed spectacles.

Intersection of Lincoln and McIlhenny~
You stand at the corner of Lincoln and McIlhenny, a small intersection
that epitomizes the residentialness of this area.  Corner cut bushes have
been planted here, baobabs of great height reach up into the sky, and
traffic is regulated by old fashioned metallic signs, rather than by the
more efficient holopolicemen.  The Sprawl seems almost, peaceful here, a
paradox that you can't shake despite the calm around you.

Center Street~
Center Street spikes down the center of the Sprawl here, aptly named as
it turns out.  It is approximately seven vehicle widths wide, a broad swath
of a mixed asphalt and concrete, as well as a combination of chemical
elements.  Tall buildings line the street both to the east and west,
towering monoliths that rear their ugly (sometimes beautiful) heads in a
haughty contempt for the world.  Gleaming windows and shiny superstructure
seem invincible in the concentrated, spotted light that is provided by
massive search lights that line the street.

Handy Hills~
Handy Hills runs north and south here, a small residential community that
seems to be in a perpetual state of drunkeness.  People lie around as if
they have no better place to be, and colored lights and bulbs flicker,
flash, and bloom all about.  It is as if a scene were taken out of a bad
Jimmy Hendrix acid trip and placed down upon a set of buildings where people
go home after a day of survival in the Sprawl.

Intersection of Kendy and Palton~
Kendy Street meets Palton Street.  Almost sounds like a prize fight
doesn't it?  The traffic here certainly behaves that way, as no discernible
form of control has been established here.  A hulking wreck of a four tread
vehicle with air vents on its side lies smoldering here, an obvious victim
of the entropy that this intersection possesses.  However, on closer
inspection, you notice the telltale marks of shell burns on its armor,
evidence that it was probably no accident that led to this vehicle's demise.

Palton Street~
Palton Street is perhaps the most unusual road you have ever been on.  It
is cone shaped, in two dimensions of course.  The end to the west is tapered
constricting traffic into the residential burb area, while the eastern end
widens out, giving easier access to the fern infested Orange Avenue.  It's
not so much residences here, instead a few shops line the street, offering
their wares, management designed to catch those travelers who are in a rush
and driving down Palton.

Palton Street~
Palton Street runs east and west here, a tapering street that defies any
normal sense of traffic flow and dynamic systems.  It is thinner in the
west, ostensibly to limit traffic into the residential burbs, and wider to
the east, allowing access to the broad pavement of Orange Avenue. 
Franchised stores line the street to the north and south, their diagonally
carved facades matching the uneven slope of the road.  Its all done up in
neon and grey, not very pretty.

Palton Street~
You stand on the fatter end of Palton Street here, a thickly paved
roadway that is busy mainly because it serves as the conduit between Orange
Avenue (big) and the residential burbs of the Sprawl (populated). 
Franchised stores made from grey steel and titanium, trimmed with gaudy neon
trappings line the street here, monopolistic monoliths that try to force the
small investor out of the market, by one means or another.  Rumor has it
that the Microsoft Corporation (slobs) hired a team of gunmen to shoot up
Seymour Cray, among other great scientific minds.  But I digress...

Intersection of Palton and Orange~
Palton Street intersects with the massive Orange Avenue here. 
Synthetically generated palm trees and fern fronds dominate the
intersection, in fact it is difficult to make out the hand gestures and
voice of the holopoliceman who directs traffic at this intersection. 
Chakras and smaller hovercraft Class II vehicles whiz underneath the trees
here, zooming by in their pollution free new designs.  Which makes you
wonder, because the Sprawl certainly is not pollution free.  In fact, if it
weren't for the massive air vents that you spot concealed in the ground, the
place would smell like crap.  As it is, it smells fake, like the
polycarbonate tags that come with stearate purchases.

Carnation Avenue~
You stand on Carnation Avenune, a peculiar mix of reality and the not so
reality.  Computer generated images overlay what you actually see with your
optical sensors, rendering a strangely out of place four dimensional image
of the time space of Carnation Avenue.  The buildings are mostly made from
gray and ribbed metal here, balanced by the lightweight but still strong
polycarbons that were invented in the 20's.  Despite the lack of any sort of
light here, you discover that you can see pretty damn well.  It must be the
heavy computing that is going on in the imaging system.  In any case,
Carnation Avenue runs to the north and south, with exits to buildings both
to the east and west.

that seem to cry out, PAINT ME!  The road itself looks old but well kept,
vicsous metal filling in and patching up those places in the road where
weather has taken its toll.  An occasional bush or tree dots the side of the
road, looking not quite normal what with all the invisible pollution in the
air here in the Sprawl.  With a quick cough, you decide it would probably be
best to move on.

carries an enormous amount of traffic, even given the fact that it runs
through the quiet residential burbs of the Sprawl.  Massive buildings glower
down upon the street, their facades sharply cast by the sunbright beams that
shine out of cannon-like spotlights that line Center Street.  Despite the
bright lighting and relative industriousness of this street, it is all
somewhat discomforting, a ratrace for survival, a whirling, twirling, mass
of seeming confusion and exhaustion.

Handy Hills~
Handy Hills blinks and pulsates with the vigor of a person who has been
taking too much illegal nitrates into his brain.  Lights have been draped
across the balconies of buildings on either side of the street, matching
perfectly the multicolored resonant paints that have been used here.  The
myriad of it all hums with the persistance of an annoying ex girlfriend,
clinging to your senses of reality even when you just want to be on with it.

autumn.  Leaves fall from boneless trees, and deciduous chickens laugh and
play here.  Upon looking at this seeming chaos, you wonder what the hell is
going on.  Apparently, someone was fu*king with your VR circuitry.  Damn

lined with artificial palm trees and fern fronds.  The entire street smells
something of pineapple juice after it has been mixed with bile and other
assorted vomit.  In other words, it doesn't smell rosy.  Massive air vents
are concealed among the fronds, structures that not only make it smell
better here, but make it possible to breathe as well.  Green green green, I
love my green trees and spam.

Carnation Avenue~
Carnation Avenue takes a sharp turn to the north and east here, an odd
sort of bend that occurs in an otherwise immensely long and straight
thoroughfare.  You can see where the computer boxes for the experimental
computer rendered street image have been secreted not so well here.  They
hang from long steel poles that are charged with voltages in excess of
100,000 Wus.  In fact, you can almost see the crackling of stale ozone
around the pole, reacting violently to the current and voltage running
through the pole.  A number of stores, shops, and other assorted goodies
have been set up along the street here old establishments that look as if
they belong here "downtown" in the Sprawl.  The neighborhood here is more
affluent than up north, as evinced by the sturdier construction of the
buildings.

Carnation Avenue~
Carnation Avenue takes a turn to the east and south here, a computer
rendered mess that leaves you wondering what you are actually seeing, and
what is being artificially implanted into your cortex.  An occasional bright
pink bunny rabbit flits across your image map as you examine the stern grey
buildings that surround the street.  Brightly lit but tasteful signs give
you instructions and directions on where to go to find the appropriate
office or business.  It is quite obvious that the Sprawl is becoming more
businesslike as you go further south, and more, well, slummy as you go
further north.

Intersection of Media and McIlhenny~
McIlhenny and Media converge here, their traffic blending like the
effluent from two tiny river subsidiaries ramming into each other.  All
about the corner here, small vendors have been set up to cater to the
residents of Media Line.  Food, wine, datacards, byte chips, and even that
old coveted item, Lubriderm are being sold here, certainly a wider variety
of items than you would have expected in the Sprawl.

Intersection of Media and Riemann~
You stand at the intersection of Media and Riemann Streets, a crossroads

It makes you think back to a poem you once heard when you were a child,
written by a Booby Frostbite or something or other.  It was called the Camel
Less Ridden, and if you recall, it was pretty damn bad.  In any case, the
intersection yawns like a chasm in front of you, a damning fork in the road
of your very existence.  
OH COME ON!  It's just a damn intersection!  Get over it.

that runs parallel to the north.  Small houses have begun to spring up along
the roadside, but still with plenty of room for development.  The road
itself does not look as new as Marlin Street, but nevertheless is smooth to
the touch and not so tasty to the lick.

impunity of a young dancer who has just made her first lead, with the
happiness of a teddy bear eating a Goldilocks, the effervescence of a
freshly opened Patsi.  Surrounding this amusing little street are a few
brand new houses that have been built here.  Many plots of lands still are
available for development so get your ass in gear and move into this
beautiful neighborhood (<-- shameless self advertising).

The spotlights that line Center Street dominate the action here,
dramatically overriding the pathetically inadequate looking street lights of
Media Line.  Triangular red flags have been draped from the northwest corner
of the intersection to the southeast corner, its purpose remaining pretty
much a mystery.

Media Line~
You stand on Media Line, a thin residential street that glimmers with the
sparkle of firewalls.  Houses have started to spring up on the street,
recent developments that stand among empty plots of land, like a poor mudder
longing for companionship.  The grass that covers each plot seems
artificial, but you don't give a damn, any type of green color is welcome
here in the Sprawl, especially after the grey and grey and more grey that
you continually see here.

still have the chance!

Media Line~
Media Line runs east and west here, a thin road that winds in between
plots of land and the occasional house.  The whole scene is a collage of
fond vignettes that you seem to remember, a collection of sights and sounds
that brings the word comfort to mind.  Its a peaceful neighborhood, similar
to th one on Marlin Street, which would make sense, since it is all part of
the same residential district.  A sign has been erected here, that reads
`n"Hanaman Builders, Call today!"  `l.

Intersection of Media and Handy~
Media Line intersects Handy here, a corner directed by a holopoliceman
dressed in typical starched uniform and pasty grin.  Laser beams search
across the width and length of the intersection, providing city planning
with important data with which to analyze the efficiency of their road
network.  Off to the north on Handy, you can hear the peculiar resonant hum
that characterizes the burg.  The sound is not overly pleasant but it DOES
match the hoopla and gaiety that is what Handy Street is all about.  Bright
colors, fast chakras, hotter babes, and whisking Kouriers party on.

Media Line~
Media Line walks itself both to the east and west here, a thin straight
shot street that is lined with waiting plots of land and a few recently
erected houses.  The air here smells overwhelmingly of pine leaves, not that
you have ever smelled pine before, everything you know about "nature" was
from that Virtual Nature game that you bought for your Sega(tm) 5megabit
game system a few years back.  It makes you wonder, because that
made-for-children game also had a stork delivering babies to the doorstep. 
In any case, the air smells fresher than in most places of the Sprawl here,
it is a nice complement to the quaint neighborhood that you find here.

Media Line~
Have you ever decided that one day, you would start memorizing clouds? 
That you would have incredible Sundays?  That you would write a love letter,
or have transformative dreams?  Eat ice cream backwards, play in your
underwear, giggle uncontrollably, bless yourself, climb trees, have dinner
with a complete stranger, shoot someone in the head with a shotgun.  Now the
question you really need to answer is: Which phrase doesn't belong up above?

Media Line~
You stand on Media Line, a quiet looking street that is shaded by small
bushes that have been planted alongside the road.  The occasional tree also
sprouts its way out of the grass covered ground.  The road itself sparkles
as if some material has been placed inside the roading mixture, a twinkling
that you can only catch when you look at the road from the corner of your
eye.  Bright gallium arsenide lights flood the area with light, a brilliant
design of reengineering microchip technology.  The compund that once allowed
massive amounts of electrical information to flow through its circuits now
does the same thing at a visible bandwidth.

Intersection of Media and Kendy~
You stand at the intersection of Media and Kendy, a robust corner in a
small residential burb in the center of the Sprawl.  The entire scene is
somewhat paradoxical, a grassy plot of free space in the center of one of
the most heavily populated areas in the history of mankind.  Flashing signs
blink way up in the sky, advertising and informing people that are more
comfortable in their flying craft than in any sort of terrestrial travel. 
And who could blame them what with all the sniper fire and land mines that
lace the streets of the Sprawl.  It is carnage incarnate, a mess of corpses
and blood that doesn't seem to want to stop.  Yet somehow, someway, the
people here are carving out a normal existence.

Orange Avenue~
Despite the hustle and bustle about you, and the close proximity of the
vegetation that grows alongside the street, you feel lonely here, as if the
entire Sprawl is just one impersonal mess.  Sometimes it hurts just to
stand, to take the abuse from yourself sometimes, sometimes its a day after
day struggle to find closeness and warmth even though the fire is burning,
and everything is TOO close.  Heat and coldness, light and darkness, they
seem to be opposites but they are so intricately intwined, so intrinsic to
each other's core, that sometimes, you just can't tell the difference.  For
instance, is Orange Avenue orange or is it black?  See, you can't tell,
because they're the same.  Sure it might be some existential ravings, but
color is not color is not the comfort you seek.  Why are there plants on
this street, artificial sure, but plants nonetheless.  Are they here for
beauty?  Doubtful because once that disgusting phenomenon of habituation
takes place, those plants get ignored.  Assimilation is what it's all about
too.  And now we're back to that sad old discussion on conformity and main
stream society.  The Sprawl is pretty damn mainstream, so are so many of the
people.  But breaking the mold isn't easy, often it isn't fun, and often,
it's just plain stupid.  Conformity, color, and comfort, to live on...

Carnation Avenue~
Carnation Avenue runs north and south here, a street that looks as if it
is primarily used for transit (ie not so many buildings on this section of
the road).  The entire street flickers and shifts periodically, due to
electromagnetic interference with the computer rendering system that has
been installed here.  Passings vehicles are in one position one moment, and
down the street in the blink of the eye.  In other words, the imaging system
that is supposed to replace lights and to provide traffic data to
construction companies isn't working so well.

Riemann Street~
Riemann Street looks like yet another one of those complex and difficult
to understand streets in the Sprawl.  Massive grey ribbed metallic buildings
rear their ugly heads up on either side of the street, punctuated only by
the flaring lights of signs, travellinng vehicles and streetlights.  A
perpetual haze seems to stretch over the entire block, pollution maybe, or
perhaps just your confusion about what this part of the Sprawl is all about.
They don't seem to be shops, or offices, or residences even.  They are just
buildings, their methods and design unknown.

Center Street~
Center Street continues its parade down the heart of the uptown Sprawl
here, a seven lane monstrosity that leaves little room for buildings on
either side.  Huge, spot lights line the road, sending their beams sideways
at an angle refracting off the black glass surface.  There is an
impersonality about this street, as if it were solely meant to be a provider
of transportation (it probably was) and not as any attempt to increase the
ascethics of the Sprawl (not that the Sprawl is by any means beautiful).

Handy Hills~
Handy Hills is the affectionate name for this wild and crazy street that
runs north and south here, a collage of spattered colors and sounds that
assails your senses (mostly in a good way) and makes you delirious in a way.
A resonant paint that hums as the wind frequency changes has been used on
almost all the buildings here, a curious defiance of the 2035 court ruling
barring its use.  It fills the air with an almost reverent sound,
complementing the loud talking, fast moving, party on atmosphere that exists
here.

Orange Avenue~
Orange Avenue runs north and south here, a wide broadband thoroughfare
that is lined with fake looking palm trees and ferns.  Vehicles whiz by on
all three designated levels of the street, the flying ones obviously on the
top level.  Traffic laws here in the Sprawl are strange to say the least, if
there are any at all.  It looks like you need damn fast reflexes to drive in
the Sprawl, as cars and hovercraft barely have the time to avoid each other
as they zoom on by.

Carnation Avenue~
You are on Carnation Avenue, just in case you have recently forgotten to
check the name field in the room description lately.  The images that you
see are a combination of your own eyesight, and the implantations of a
recent new development that computer enhances the area, and retransmits it
directly into your cerebral cortex.  It is not an overly pleasant
experience, bugs are still being hammered out.  Off to the east, a massive,
old fashioned, chain link fence has been erected, blue crackling voltage
leaping from the fence to the occasional stray piece of metal that floats
by.  Beyond the fence, you see a massive collection of buildings, centered
about a stone domed structure that has some sort of vapor trailing out of
its top.

Riemann Street~
You stand on Riemann Street, a somewhat drab street that is dominated by
grey ribbed, half plastic, half metal buildings that seem cold with
impersonality.  Occasional speckles of bright light dot the hulking
structures, thin pinpoints of light that only emphasize the darkness of the
buildings.  They rear high up into the sky, making it impossible to see
anything beyond that which is on Riemann Street.  The buildings are
nondescript also, at this juncture it is impossible to tell if they are
offices, residences, or anything else.

Riemann Street~
Riemann Street is just one example of how technology can destroy
creativity and personal touch.  Prefabricated grey polysteel buildings line
the street here, relatively ugly structures that are strong, cheap, and
ideal for offices and other large floor space needs.  Everything looks the
same however, an ordered existence that seems awfully constricting.  Where
are the things that make a city beautiful?  Certainly, they are not in this
section of the Sprawl.

Center Street~
Center Street rumbles both north and south here, a massive causeway that
carries an enormous amount of traffic, even given the fact that it runs
through the quiet residential burbs of the Sprawl.  Massive buildings glower
down upon the street, their facades sharply cast by the sunbright beams that
shine out of cannon-like spotlights that line Center Street.  Despite the
bright lighting and relative industriousness of this street, it is all
somewhat discomforting, a ratrace for survival, a whirling, twirling, mass
of seeming confusion and exhaustion.

Handy Hills~
As you walk slowly down Handy Hills, you are amazed at the diversity you
see here.  Buildings that look like residences have been spruced up in
decorative chemical glitters, and with resonant paints that hum as you look
at them.  The entire street gives you a "partying" feeling, as if the people
and music on this street do not rest at night, and only occasionally during
the day.  Lights of varying colors hang draped above you across the width of
the street, suspended in between the balconies and awnings of seeral
buildings.  The chatter of people here stems not only from the people who
abound, but from the goldenlocks that flap and squawk on the roofs overhead.

Handy Hills~
Handy Hills winds slowly to the north and west here, a bend in the color
filled and NOISY street.  A string og bright blue bulbs has been draped
across the facades of buildings here, oftentimes stretching across the width
of the street.  Streamers and other various decorations hang from windows
and cover the ground.  The shops on either side of the street also lend
themselves to the carnival-like atmosphere, peddling colorful wares in their
windows, most of which have no practical use.

Broad Street~
Broad Street resumes its east west direction here, winding its way
through numerous shops and residences.  A set of strange looking white poles
that stick out of the ground in the center of the road is the centerpiece of
attraction here.  As you look carefully at the triad of stakes, you notice
that at their base, a `iplague`l has been fastened, made from solid gold,
but firmly stuck to the poles.  Evidently, it is a riddle of some type, one
of those strange quirks of a city that is best known for its wholesale
slaughter and crime.  The three white poles do not move in the wind, and
feel almost sandy to the touch.  Looking even more closely, you can see that
the middle pole is taller than the right pole which is taller than the left
pole which is taller than the middle pole.  Huh?  Ever hear of MC Escher? 
Famous old d00d who's dead but he drew kewl stuffs.

Broad Street~
You stand on Broad Street, a virtual potpourri of culture and color and
sound and noise in a place where they seem so limited and dead.  The Sprawl
doesn't really have much culture or anythang like dat.  But the entire
district has been made up with artistic smiles and bright colored lights
that emphasize how rich this section really is.  Buildings lines the street,
their grey and black and white metallic walls sculpted as if professional
architects rather than crappy city planners created these structures.

Broad Street~
Broad Street is a medium sized street that carries a disproportionate
amount of traffic east and west on its two tiered surface.  Perhaps it is
all the attractions on this street that cause people to cut through here on
their way to work, or to play, or to wherever they are trying to go. 
Numerous theatres dot the landscape, as well as a myriad of odd shops,
residences, and people.  Everything seems rather colorful here, although not
gaudily so.  Bright lights have been fashionably put up in front of
buildings, trying to attract people to come inside.
