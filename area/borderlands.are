noguri man lord~
Noguri~
The Malkier lord Noguri sits here, wallowing in self-pity.
~
He is sallow looking man, dressed in clothes that have gone unwashed far
too long.  His skin is a pale yellow, drawn over his bones, emaciated and
pitiful.  Tears run down his skeletal face, over some sadness that occurred
many years ago.  He does not look like much of a threat, but deep down
inside, you think you can see the heart and courage that made him a Malkier
lord.

Lord Takken~
A man sits here, skinning his latest trolloc head.
~
Only this man's mother could ever have said he was attractive.  Scars
criss cross his face, and nostrils that are too big for his nose flare out
from time to time.  His cheekbones are a bit too high and his forehead a bit
too flat.  In your calculations, he looks a bit like a kazuo.

Naya~
Lady Naya sits here at her desk, reading a thick, bound book.
~
She is a beautiful woman, with midnight black hair that runs down to her
waist.  She has a look of intelligence and wisdom, yet her face betrays her
youth.  You wonder how this graceful and wonderful woman became a Lady of
Malkier, but when she turns and glares at you, you have your answer.

Manx~
A man clad in black stands here, watching you with a grin.
~
Before you stands a man clad almost completely in black, broken only by
the two diagonal red slashes that run across his surcoat.  He moves with a
cat-like grace, seldom wasting a motion.  His hands are at ease by his
sides.  It is not until you see him smirk and flash for his daggers that you
get a good look at this man's dark face.  Although he is a Malkier lord, he
is far from noble.

It is a membranous little monster, tentacles reaching out in the front of
its head.  You can see where blood vessels run through its translucent frame
which is odd, since you didn't think leeches had blood vessels.  But then

The Eye of the World~
The spiraling staircase opens up into a high ceilinged chamber that glows
with the brilliance of the afternoon sun.  The ceiling of the room is
covered with clumps of a crystal, most brilliantly aglow.  However, you
can see the marks of the Wheel on this room, as some of the crystals have
flamed out, leaving patches of black in the dome of light.  The floor of 
the room is dominated by a massive elliptical pool, shaped like the eye of
a god.  Its waters seem not like water, so mirrorlike and hypnotic their
effect. The pool leaves only a few feet of walkway around the room, the path
covered in age old dust and crushed bits of rockcrystal.  Although you sense
no danger here, something tells you to turn and leave at once.

of a staircase spiraling downward.  Like the hallway before, the pure white
of the walls glows with an unnatural light, comforting but disturbing at the

your way down into the depths.

neck are even stronger here, yet you sense the light and everything else
about this hallway are benign and not harmful.  Up ahead, you see the start
of a staircase leading downwards.

A glowing corridor~
You step into a brilliantly lit corridor, predominantly white and
polished with a clear attention to detail.  Although the floor looks as if
it has polished with extreme care and vigor, your footing is sure and
strong.  Small bits of red, blue, yellow and every other color imaginable
dot the purity of the walls, making it look like a glorious myriad of
paintings, there but not there, serene and warning at the same time.  The
walls themselves give off the light of the corridor, brilliant and
unnatural.

Before a shimmering archway~
You stand before a tall glowing archway, trivially thin and
flimsy-looking.  Beyond the archway, you can see nothing, as its interior is
masked by a shimmering wall, deep in its blue and reds.  Small flowers grow
around the bases of the arch, making it seem benign, but the tingling in the
back of your neck suggests otherwise.  You just might want to return to the
peace of the glade behind you.

The Green Man's Glade~
You stand in a slightly overgrown clearing, framed by towering, green
trees to the north and the west, barring your way.  Flowers grow on the
ground and birds chirp merrily away in the air.  The atmosphere here is
fresh, like it is the newest spring.  Quite a contrast from the stifling
stench and heat of the Blight.  You feel at ease here, as if nothing can
touch the peace and tranquility offered by the glade's fauna.

trees.  The scent and sight of budding flowers brings happiness to your
heart and energy to your travel weary feet.  The verdancy of the glade and
the freshness of the air put you at ease here.  Perhaps you might want to
kick off the boots and rest in the shade of the mammoth tree just to the
south.

both to the north and east here.  Flowers in full bloom provide the myriad
of colors in the clearing: reds, yellows, and blues, and violets make for a
wonderful combination.  You feel at peace with yourself here, away from all
the fighting and the horrors of the Blight.

The Center of the Green Man's Glade~
You stand on a small rounded knoll, covered with grass and other
flowering buds.  But a massive tree is what grabs your attention, its
gnarled branches seem to reach out for you, not to harm, but to embrace,
from one living being to another.  The air here smells as pure as the
clearest spring water, and you feel a sense of peace here that so seldom
comes in these trying times.

The Green Man's Glade~
The forest about you continues north and south here, preventing you from
going to the east.  Flowers are in full bloom here, pleasing your eye and
forcing you to tread lightly.  Nevertheless, the abundance of flowers makes
you feel guilty when you accidentally crush one with your half-wit step. 
Nevertheless, you feel at ease here, comfortable and rested.

The Green Man's Glade~
You stand in a shaded, grassy clearing, slightly overgrown with colorful
flowers and the occassional pretty weed.  Although the fauna seems to grow
haphazardly about the clearing, everything seems perfect, perfect in place,
perfect in color, perfect in smell.  You feel comfortable here, perhaps you
might sit and rest for a while.

The Green Man's Glade~
The grass here feels like a matress made from the finest nobleman's down.
The flowers smell of the finest perfume ever worn and the air drinks like
the finest mountain spring water.  A towering wall of trees prevents you
from heading south here, but you feel at ease, unwilling to leave the
sanctity of this place so soon.

Trail to the Seven Towers~
The ground here is more solid than before, characterized by an uneven
rocky surface and hard brown dirt.  But what catches your eye are the ruins
of towers directly up ahead, and one looming, intact tower standing in their
center.  Piles of rubble and debris make it impossible to plot a straight
course for the towers, forcing you to detour to the west a short distance up
ahead.  There is a certain sadness about the entire area, as if a a tragedy
beyond words occurred here.

ahead are even closer now, so close you can see the cracks in the mortar and
the vegetation growing on its walls.  Of course, here in the Blight, they
are unidentifiable, but you probably want to get a better look anyway.

Trail to the Seven Towers~
The trail continues onward here.  Piles of rock and other debris prevent
you from heading any further west, but the single intact tower looms
directly to the north.  You can make out the arrow slits even from this
distance, staggered diagonally across the face of the tower.  The
battlements look a bit worn by weather or other forces and the walls are
stained a faint rose color.  You don't even want to think about what that
stain came from.

The Seventh Tower of Malkier~
You stand at the base of the only intact tower in the entire area.  With
only mild surprise, you realize that the rose colored stains on the walls
are actually caked and dry blood, preserved by the dryness of the Blight. 
Broken spears and swords litter the ground here, as do a number of human
bones, and other bones, too big for a human but sized for a trolloc.  It
looks like there used to be a gate here, its outline plainly evident in the
hard grey stone.  However, it looks as if it has been sealed for many
summers, and now is definitely impassable.

Trail to the Seven Towers~
The rocky trail continues to the west here, framed on the north by a
virtual barricade of rocks and crushed mortar.  The footing is uneven,
making it hard for you to walk.  Directly up ahead, you see the remnants of
what once must have been a glorious tower.  It's little more than a shell
now, crushed and abandoned.

Approaching a broken tower~
The rocky trail continues onward here.  Directly up ahead are the ruined
remnants of one the famed towers of Malkier.  Little of the second floor
seems to be intact, and much of it seems to have been burned long ago.  The
wooden gate of the tower lies on the ground besides the tower's opening,
slowly decaying in the sickly atmosphere of the Blight.  You can only head
west here, as high piles of rubble block the way to the north and south.

Before a broken tower~
You stand halfway in the shadows of the opening of the ruined tower.  It
is dark as night inside the tower, its signal lamps long ago extinguished by
the vanquishing.  The tower inside looks no more stable than its outside,
the occasional dust of mortar drifting down from weakening ceilings and
beams.  Maybe you should just take the trail to the north instead of going
in.

battlements wrecked and ruined.  Judging from this angle, this tower is in
even worse shape than the first one.  Creeping ivy winds around and in
between the crumbling mortar, further accelerating its decay.  Broken bits
of steel and wood also litter the dark opening of the tower, obvious signs
of a battle long ago.

A rocky path amidst the towers~
The path continues to the west here, in its uneven broken manner.  You've
been looking at the bright white stakes broken on the ground for quite some
time now, you realize that they were probably markers for this path at some
time, when it was more than just a path, it was a magnificent highway of
great grandeur and beauty.

The Seventh Tower of Malkier~
You stand beneath the western facade of the only intact tower amidst the
ruins.  It stretches high above you, its arrow slits and defensive
fortifications intimidating to say the least.  It was not built for beauty,
like most things in the borderlands, it was build for function, to kill
trollocs and fades.  A massive portcullis bars the way into the tower, but
it looks rusty and easily breakable.

and the elements.  However, this one is in slightly better condition, the
second floor remains partially intact and you can even see the burning
illumination of lamps within the entrance.  The porticullis that once
guarded this entrance consists of frayed ends of metal, it looks almost as
if a hole was melted right through it.

The once proud boulevard of the Malkier continues to the east here, a
pale shambles of its former self.  Bright white signposts litter the ground,
completing the cluttered, uneven surface.  Just to the south, a small
doorway swings halfway open, on one rusty brass hinge.  The wood does not
seem very well off, it is rotten and eaten through with worms.  You realize
that this must be the back entrance to the seventh tower of the Malkier.

stands.  It is more or less intact, and looks as formidable as it ever could
have.  Arrow slits protect the approach, and a deep dry moat surrounds the
chiseled walls.  A drawn porticullis bars the way into the tower, amazingly
enough, it looks sturdy and well kept.

of here.  A closed porticullis gate prevents you from examining the building
from the inside.  Nevertheless, there is something awe inspiring about just
the exterior.  Powerful in its silence, nevertheless it exudes sorrow and
loss.  Perhaps you can force your way in, otherwise you'll have to continue
down the rocky path to the east.

tower.

You stand in a darkened arched entryway, littered with broken rocks
armor, and weapons.  Deep grooves run along either side of the archway where
a massive iron porticullis once stood.  Obviously, it is no longer there,
torn down in what you assume was a battle.  A hallway leads off to the west
here.  It's dark there as well, and you can't see much further than a few
paces.

from disuse and the elements.  The hallway continues on to the west and also
heads to the north up a wider passageway here.

However, the ceiling has caved in here, making it impossible for you to head
any further west.  Although it may be possible to pick your way through the
wreckage, it is dark despite your lighting and very hard to see.  A small
oaken door stands to the south, surprisingly intact.

thing of note in this small cubical of a room is the wooden bench along the
east wall.  Two holes are cut into its top, elliptical and smooth to the
touch.  It's not until you are assailed with the noxious scent of human

a staircase of some sort.

Malkier victory over a pack of trollocs.  Lanterns flicker in their sconces

walls are starting to erode at both its top and bottom.  Some of the wall's

nap.  Like the hallway outside, the walls are covered with various
tapestries and paintings.  Urns and other bits of furniture fill up the

bath.  The copper tub has been polished to a fine sheen, and is covered only
in some places by a thin layer of dust.  For not the first time, you wonder

written.  The walls are unadorned, but they have managed to retain
structural integrity at least, and look as defensible as ever.

either side of you, arrow slits guard the entrance, unfortunately, they lay
unmanned now.  High up above, you see similar slits and holes, probably also
used for defense.  The section is not visually pleasing but you don't think
this place was built for an art festival, few things in the borderlands or
Blight ever are.

Servant's quarters~
This room is only about four or five spans across, just large enough to
fit a bed, dresser, and a few other personals.  The walls are unadorned, as
if the room had a frequent turnover and residents had little time to add
their own bit of spice to it.  A bell hangs over the doorway here, connected
to a golden branch of rope that you saw lead to the main bedroom.  You can
only assume that this is the servant's quarters, where they awaited their
master's calls.

Central Hallway of the Third Tower~
The central hallway continues onward here, complete with flickering
lanterns and hung tapestries.  An oldish looking door stands to the north
here, unlocked and slightly ajar.  A smaller but obviously newer door is
closed to the east.  Peculiarly, the hallway here is in a less pristine
condition than the hallway to the south, the walls are a bit crumbly, and
the ceiling looks faintly saggy.

A dusty bedroom~
At first glance, you think that you may have stepped into a storage room.
However, the white masses that you saw covered with dust at first are in
fact sheets covering various articles of furniture.  A bed, chair, dresser,
and couch all lie underneath the massively dusty coverings.  No soul has
probably visited this room in many many rooms.  Once again, the differences
between this room and the other rooms in the tower leave you perplexed.

cave-in resumes the pattern of the rest of Malkier, ruined and decrepit.

The ladder deposits you off here, although it looks like the ladder once
continued upward.  The ceiling has been ceiled off, apparently by the
residents of this place.  In any case, you stand in a hallway that runs
north and south, but ends quickly in either direction.  A hallway looks like
it also led of to the east at some point, but is now collapsed and
impassable.

You leave the steel ladder behind you and enter a dark part of the
corridor.  The lanterns have gone out here, leaving you to provide your own
light.  The tapestries that once adorned the walls now liw in crumpled heaps
on the floor, pale shadows of their former selves.  It smells very musty up
here as well, as if a fresh breeze has not not blown through this hallway in
many many years.

the content is not so exciting, they depict gruesome battles between the
Malkier and trollocs and fades, blood rushing onto the ground.  It is not
something you ordinarily see in a hallway decoration, but then again, this
is no ordinary ruins either.

You have arrived at an intersection of two hallways in the center of the
tower.  They both look almost identical, lavishly decorated walls, brightly
lit by torches and glowing with the same surrealism that strikes you as so
odd.  In any case, a ladder made of gold and brass extends out of a hole in
the ceiling here, allowing you access to the second floor of the tower.

that that hold flat tapestries against the walls.  They depict victories of
the Malkier over trollocs and fades.  They are gruesome and ghastly in their
depictions.  The corridor is well lit by torches hanging in spaces between
tapestries.  However, the flames give off no heat or smoke, giving the
entire scene a surreal effect.

tapestries.  The scenes are bloody and most unpleasant, almost all
consisting of a Malkier victory over trollocs and fades.  The whole hallway
is very surreal, almost impossible in light of the shattered ruins that the
rest of Malkier has become.

is brightly lit by burning torches on either wall, yet through the decor of
it all, something does not feel quite right.  Everything seems almost too
perfect and in place.  Despite the ruins of the rest of Malkier, this
building is in splendid condition.  You ponder this fact, and continue on.

Malkier ruins.  The hallway is brightly lit by torches burning on either
wall.  However, the torches do not give off any smoke, and do not seem to
give off much heat either.  Something feels wrong here, the shadows are a
bit too long, the walls a bit too ornate with tapestries and paintings. 
This is supposed to be a ruins after all.

Trolloc and myrrdraal heads have been taken and nailed to the walls with a
single large spike through the forehead.  The sight is gruesome, as the time
was not even taken to clean up the corpse parts, blood stains run out from
the heads, marring the sleet grey of the walls.

that spirals upwards.  Its frame is made of a thick, corrugated, black
metal, and the stairs themselves are constructed from a deep red wood.  A
thin bannister guides your way up the staircase, where you can see it ends
in a small room.  Like most of this tower, the scene is hazy and ethereal,
you wonder if it is real at all.

girth.  It is difficult to see where the ladders lead, but you do hear

themselves, and left only the beams and an earthen lining to shelter the
area.  The resultant rocks and dust lies in the center of the room,
scattered haphazardly and piled high.  It is hard to see past the pile, but
when you do manage to catch a glimpse, it is nothing of note.

A cave-in~
The cavelike passageway comes to an abrupt end here in a virtual
avalanche of rocks and wooden support beams.  The pileup makes further
passage impossible and looks very unstable as well.  You think that leaving
back the way you came would be a good idea.

The Killing Zone~
The porticullis opens up here into a short, well lit hallway.  The
passage is only twenty paces across, where you can see a ladder leading up
into a whole in the ceiling.  Long vertical slits runs along the length of
the bare walls, allowing defenders to fire their projectiles into the
corridor.  A metal grating above you would also most likely be used by
defenders in the tower.

The Base of the Seventh Tower~
The two hallways come to an intersection here, where a ladder leads the
way upwards.  The ladder is made from a strong material, night black and
smooth to the touch.  You don't see anything special as you look up, it
seems to be a well-lit room similar to what you stand in now.  However,
there is apparently no other exits, so you might as well head up.

The Killing Zone~
The porticullis swings open and you find yourself in a thin corridor,
well lit by torches fastened to the walls.  It seems it is a short hallway,
as you can see another porticullis opposite you roughly forty paces away. 
Long, vertical arrow slits run up and down the side walls here, and grates
up above allow defenders to pour their boiling acid down upon you. 
Fortunately, there doesn't seem to by anyone home.

The hallway here is much like the other sections you have seen, with long
grey bare walls and a number of arrow slits cut into them.  Unlike the other
three alcoves, there is no entrance here.  It looks as if it has been sealed
shut as you can still see the outline of a door, but it clearly is now
impassable.

You stand in a thin, brightly lit hallwaythat runs south from here. 
There isn't much to say about it, except that the walls are a bare gray
granite, and that it look like it was made for defense.  Long vertical slits
run along the length of both walls, and small gratings open the way for
attack from up above.  Although it is probably only twenty paces to the
ladder in the center of an intersection, you probably wouldn't make it there
is someone didn't want you to.

You have entered what appears to be a bedroom of some type.  A large,
canopied, mahogany-framed bed sits in the far corner of the room, and other
various furnitures dot the area.  A thick rug made of some type of brown fur
covers the floor of the room as well.  It is not until you see the gruesome
trolloc head nailed to the wall that you realize what exactly the rug is
made up of, matted trolloc hair.

The quarters of Takken~
These quarters have been gruesomely decorated in the tradition of a
warrior in the Blight.  Eveyr decoration seems to have been sculpted out of
trolloc horns or made from trolloc hides.  What seems to be the crowning
achievement of this man, is the bedding that is made from the
stitched-together hides of four myrrdraals.  Otherwise, the walls have been
left grey, and the floor is the cold hard granite of the tower itself.

You stand in a smallish room, probably occupied by a Malkier lord most of
the day.  The room is decorated in shades of black, grey, and red, and has a
most foreboding flavor.  A tiny sliver of a bed rests in one corner of the
room, and a table rests against the opposite one.  A set of carefully
polished daggers rests on the table, ready for use, and in plain view for
all to see.

A plush teal carpet covers the floor from wall to wall here, making you feel
almost guilty about treading on it with your muddy boots.  However, your
steps leave absolutely no trace on the ground here anyway.  A solid looking
and reinforced oaken door stands on the west wall, inviting you to enter. 
The sense of surrealism has returned, giving you the impression that what
you are seeing, you are not really seeing.

clashed before.  You shake the cobwebs out of your brains before noticing
the oaken door on the west wall and decide to go on.

The hallway runs east to west here, a corridor approximately ten paces
wide.  Surprisingly, the floor is covered in a thick plush carpet here that
makes you feel guilty about wearing your boots.  The teal of the carpet does
not quite match the colors of the tapestries on the walls, which are a sharp
gold color, but the whole scene gives off an ambience of domesticity.  The
proximity of this area to the defenses below is somewhat surprising, but you
assume the designers of this place knew what they were doing.

north wall, hiding whatever lies in that direction.  The walls here are

wonder if there is something wrong with your head, rather than with the
lighting.  In any case, an ornate looking staircase stands just to the south
of here, or you can head back through the residential area.

You stand at the base of an ornately worked staircase, made from what
appears to be pink marble, and spiraling gently upwards.  A railing made
from gold prevents one from falling off the inner edge of the staircase and
also helps you to find your footing on the immaculately polished surface. 
The staircase spirals so high upwards, that is is impossible to see what
lies at its end.  If only it were as beautiful as the staircase itself.

and decide they blend.  The whole atmosphere is surreal and you are starting

The quarters of Elbin~
These apparently, are the living quarters of a Malkier lord.  The room is
ornately decorated with a variety of gold and silver urns, and the walls are
covered with ornately woven tapestries and paintings.  Although much of the
room is spotted with colors, the ambience as a whole gives you a sense of
purity and wholeness, of whiteness.  Perhaps it is the high domed ceiling,
illuminated by a floating globe of light in its center.  Or perhaps it is
the peculiar neatness with which everything is arranged.

corner.  The furniture in the room also continues the theme with natural

impression of calmness and oneness with the environment around you.  Perhaps

arranged against the walls of the room.  It is almost impossible to take
note of anything else contained in the chamber, not even the spectacular
view offered by its lone window.

As you enter the room, you are surprised by the absence of almost any
light in this room.  The window has been drawn shut and flames extinguished.
Although the room seems to be decorated neatly enough, and with some
attention to taste and colors, it seems to be the chamber of a man of
meditation and thoughts.  Perhaps it is the number of holy symbols hanging
from the walls, or perhaps it is the lack of much furniture in the room. 
Whatever it is, you just felt that sense of surrealism again.

because there is so little wall space between the oaken doors both to the

if they have not been opened for years.

The quarters of Gwell~
The chambers here seem to have been made for a man half and again the
normal size.  The bed just seems to be far too small, and the dresser and
wardrobe far too short.  Otherwise, the room seems fairly normal, not too
lavish or extravagant.  Paintings of generic nature scenes adorn the walls,
and the carpeting in the room is slightly stained from ale and food crumbs. 
While the man who lives here is certainly not a slob, he is not the precise
person who tidies up every minute of the day.  A window in the south wall is
slightly stained from disuse, but it offers you a brilliant view of the
surrounding Blight.

disaster as a first glance might assume, but it is an organized chaos. 
Somewhere amidst the boxes, furnititure, and papers, a small cot has been
tucked into the corner, sheets rumpled and unmade.  For the thousandth time,
the feeling of surrealism hits you, making you nauseous and dizzy.

foul stench of death, and that sense of obscene surrealism hits you again.

brilliantly lit and lavishly decorated.  The staircase has been covered with
the same rose-colored carpet that covers the hallway, weighed down at each
step with a gold rod fastened across its length.  Glowballs line the walls
here, brilliantly aglow, yet emanating a soft light that never hurts your
eyes.  A few last portraits are spaced in between the glowballs here, eyes
staring at you with a sense of suspicion.

neatly severed and still bleeding.  The walls have been left their original

There is only one item of furniture in the room, a chair made from wicker
and a soft reed wood.  The walls have been painted a soft white, and a white
ball of light hovers high above, providing the illumination.  The chair has
been positioned directly under the ball of light, and facing the door.  You
have no idea what kind of room this is, or what kind of person would live
here, but you are sure, it is no place you would want to be.

boots.  Strangely, no matter how hard you try to stain the immaculate
looking carpet, not a spot sullies the plush surface.

This room look more like an arsenal than any type of bedroom.  Wooden
dowels have somehow been inserted into the grey granite walls of the room. 
Upon these dowels, various weapons have been hung.  This man's weapon
preferences obviously include the sword and the mace.  A bed and dresser
here have been chosen for their functionality, not for any sense of beauty. 
However, a large picture window in the south wall offers you what must once
have been a spectacular view of the surrounding countryside.

the east here, resplendent in its golden shimmer and heavy in its tragedy. 
For the millionth time, the sickening feeling of surrealism washes over you
again, and you think to yourself, none of this is real.

The Throne of al'Akir~
The throne of Malkier.  It is a massive golden chair, large enough to
seat two people, with some left over for children.  You can plainly see
golden cranes flying through the sky, etched into the chair's arms and legs.
The wall to the north of the throne is dominated by a mural of a golden
crane in flight, magnificent and awe-inspiring.  The throne sits under a
collection of glowballs suspended high in the air, giving you the impression
that this throne, this room, is the very center of the Creator's will, the
heart of the Light.  The wave of surealism that you feel even now dispels
that notion partially, but you think it just may be true.

You stand in the northeast corner of the chamber here, just north of the
last granite column.  From here, you can see the side of the throne of
Malkier, its gold gleaming in the brilliant light of the room.  You have
seen palaces that do not look nearly so magnificent, and with not nearly the
power that this throne once possessed.

You stand amidst the great granite columns here, almost engulfed in their
immensity.  The west wall of the chamber has been covered in a thin white
carpet, held in place by horizontal golden rods, hammered down every few
paces.  From here, your line of sight is very limited.  You can see up the
side of the columns, or across the chamber to the other set of columns.

A rose carpeted path~
The carpeted path continues among the massive granite columns here,
bringing you inexorably closer to the gold mass that is the throne of
Malkier.  You can see the throne from here, and the mural of the golden
crane on the wall behind it.  The whole scene is more magnificent than you
could have ever imagined it, although that sense of fantasy is back, and the
magnificent view seems sullies and somehow corrupt.

You stand at the base of some of the biggest columns you have ever seen. 
Their granite composition is hard, yet they feel smoother than the finest
silk you have ever held.  The east wall of the chamber is not decorated with
ornate paintings or tapestries.  Instead, it is covered by a white carpet
that is held in place by horizontal golden rods, placed every few paces.

a thin white carpet, held in place with golden rods hammered down every few
paces or so.  You can't see the throne of Malkier from here, but you can
almost feel its power and radiance.

A rose carpeted path~
The long march up the carpeted path takes you between the hulking columns
that look over both your shoulders.  The carpet here is a pretty rose color,
but it is neither the softness of the carpet, or the size of the columns
that grabs your attention.  Directly ahead, is the throne of Malkier, a gold
mass of power and the former seat of all the borderlands.  The entire scene
is almost overwhelming, but then that sense of surrealism is back and
nothing seems real anymore.

the chamber are not adorned with fancy paintings or tapestries, but instead
are covered with a thin carpet, white in its purest form.  You cannot see
the throne from here, but you can almost sense its presence and power.

The staircase comes to an end here, and you enter a magnificent domed
chamber.  The ceiling of the chamber is adorned with a magnificent painting,
of men and women of Malkier, lifting their arms up to the creator.  The
chamber itself consists of a red carpeted walkway in the center, framed by
massive granite columns that reach up to the ceiling.  At the end of the
walkway, you can see what appears to be a massive, golden throne.

On drier ground~
The ground here is drier and the vegetation has finally dropped away from
the sides of the trail.  Rocks crunch under your feet, and you finally have
an opportunity and reason to wipe the clingy black mud from your boots. 
Directly north of you, you can see the looming structure of a massive tower
as well as the ruins of several others.  The trail ahead is a rocky one,
most likely set there by the founders of this once magnificent land.  It is
a sad story that these people have almost become forgotten in so short a
time, but a tragedy is a tragedy.

The path continues either north here, or to the east in the direction of
the hideous looking lake.  To the north, the vegetation thins out and the
ground appears to be made of a sturdier substance than mud.  The vegetation
seems to shy away from the rocky ground of the north, and the looming towers
that you failed to notice until just now.  A high spire stands amidst a ring
of six ruined towers.  It is majestic but sad at the same time, its story a
book in itself.

covered rocks.  The waters here are not clear and blue like the others you
have passed, instead it is a deep inky black, and reeks of raw sewage.  The
path leads off to the west here, and you think you had better hurry up and
take it.

You stand before yet another lake of the Malkier.  It wasn't called the
Hundred Lakes of Malkier for no reason after all.  The path continues on
around the lake to the east, a small muddy one that only offers a width for
two people walking abreast.  As you pick your way along the trail, you see a
massive suction cup lined tentacle reach out of the water.  It is a deep
black and definitely does not look friendly.

They look forlorn, and speak of a tragedy that came to pass long ago.  In
any case, the trail continues on to the east, where you can make out the
form of yet another lake in the vegetation.

away from the water even more here, as if it's scared of what lies beneath
its murky waters.  You feel a sense of foreboding here, and think about
turning around and leaving at once.

corrupted and twisted.

seem to avoid the waters, as if it contained something poisonous.  Thus, you
are afforded a path that leads around the lake and to the west.  Suddenly, a
massive tentacle, lined with horrid suction cups emerges from the depths,
looking for you or any other food source.

However, that notion is quickly dispelled by a massive tentacle that roils
out of the water, seeking its next prey.  The path continues east along the
edge of the lake, you had better get moving or expect a fight.

decide to move on.

the reeds are sentient, and are allowing you to pass, but not making it any
easier than absolutely necessary.  Far to the north, you can make out the
hulking shapes of stone stumps.  It's a little bit too far to tell what they
are for sure, you'll have to get a closer look.  Another lake stands
directly to the north here.

path seems to have been cut through the twisted vegetation, but it offers
you little in the way of better footing.  Up ahead, you can make out a few
lakes, their waters surprisingly clear and blue for anything in the Blight. 
The path in the reeds takes up north here.

A desert in the Blight~
The sands of each dune you cross shift effortlessly under your feet,
making each step all the more difficult.  The heat is approaching an
unbearable level, forcing you to shed some of your heavier clothings. 
Although the desert seems to stretch far off into all directions, you think
you can make out the shimmer of water off to the east, and the accompanying
green foliage.  But its probably a mirage, you've seen it many times before.

you think you can make out the shimmer of water.  But then again, it's
probably a mirage.  The shimmer of water is something you've seen before.

its deadly fashion.

is no escape in sight either, in all directions, there is simply more of the
same.

Perhaps your eyes have not deceived you at last.  A little bit further

still have green leaved boughs.  But like the rest of the Blight you have
been in, it all seems unnatural.  The branches are not bent towards any
discernible source, but rather they seem to cry out and bend away from
themselves, as if they cannot bear their horrid existence.

looks and smells of taint and the Blight.

The softness of the ground surprises you here in the Blight.  The trees
that surround you are spindly shadows of their former selves, leafless and
with a sickly gray color that betrays their horrid health.  It seems as if
the trees reach out towards you, looking to suck the vibrant life that your
body still contains.  Occasionally, a leaf buds from a branch, a ghastly
yellow and blotched like a leper.  It is horrifying to behold, and you think
you want to leave here now.

your cheek in what feels like a lover's caress, as if the trees are telling
you that they want you, they want to suck the very marrow of your bones out
of your life giving body.  The corruption in the air makes you sick, and you
decide that you probably want to get out of here.

your husk, in an effort todrain that life from you.  It heavies your heart
to see anything in this state of corruption, but you must head on, if you do

Here you stand in a forest in the Blight.  The trees about you are
leafless and splotched, as if some foul leprosy has overtaken them.  As you
pass each one, its branches seem to reach down towards you.  At first, it is
simply a touch, then a pinch, then you realize that these foul trees are
trying to grab you and if possible, suck your very existence out of your
husk of a body.  Perhaps it would be wisest if you turned and ran about now.

Trees that normally should be in full bloom in this heat and humidity are
leafless here, afflicted with what looks like the plant kingdom's equivalent
to leprosy.  The grey trunks are spotted with sickly yellows and blacks, and
ooze a strange sap out of cracks in the trunks.  If possible, it seems as if
the trees are looking at you hungrily, as if they want to feed off of your
blood filled body.

themselves are twisted almost beyond recognition.  Sickly grey branches
reach down to brush your cheek, almost in a caress that longs for the life
that courses through your body.  You feel the need to leave this forest at
once, however, this abomination extends off into all directions.

A desert in the Blight~
The sands of each golden brown dune seeps down into your boots with each
step you take.  The scenery is much the same, sand and sand and sun and
sand.  Besides the fact that you are cooking like a day old side of beef,
you can sense there is something wrong here.  After all, this is the Blight,
and nothing here can be quite natural.

A desert in the Blight~
You stand in the mother of all deserts, vast beyond all comprehension and
despicable in its lethality.  The sun's corona blazes down at you, like it
is Shaitan himself who glares down at the intruders into his domain.  Only 2
landmarks decorate this otherwise horrid landscape.  Far to the north, you
can make out the faint slopes of a towering mountain, and far to the east,
you make out the greenish brown tinge of foliage.

A desert in the Blight~
The desert continues onward here.  The sand seems to suck you in with
each step, like it is a hungry animal yearning to be fed.  The sun above you
is merciless, a ball of fire glaring angrily at the world, as if Shaitan
himself has reached down and cast his finger of evil at the intruders in his
domain.

A desert in the Blight~
The angry heat of the sun beats down upon your head mercilessly as you
trudge through the knee deep sands of the Blight.  It might be easier to
continue onwards if you had a direction to go.  For everywhere you scan, the
desert continues on, seemingly oblivious of your presence, yet deadly still.

A desert in the Blight~
You try to maintain your footing, but the shifting of the sand dunes
makes it almost impossible to walk with any steady gait.  All about, you are
surrounded by more of the dreaded Blight sand, golden brown and tainted with
the touch of Shaitan.  The orb of fire high in the sky lashes you with its
obscene heat, burning your skin and soaking your clothes in malodorous
sweat.

Perhaps it was not a mirage after all.  A league off to the east, you can
make out the green leaves of foliage and brush, although from this distance,
they look like no plant you have ever seen.  But they offer shelter from the
beating heat upon your head, and quite possibly, a footing other than the
frustrating shifts of the desert sands.

The forest continues onward in all directions here.  However, to the west
the trunks are spaced further and further apart and through these spaces,
you can see the dunes of golden sand rising up and down.  The temperature is
even hotter here, making the branches of the forest look even more twisted
and sickly.

You stand in the middle of a corrupt looking forest, decadent looking and
sickly to the smell and touch.  Twisted branches, wrapped with grey-brown
vines reach down and brush your body, seemingly with a hunger that you can

preventing you from making a hasty exit out of it.

The forest here is a corrupted shadow of what you might see in most
places.  The leaves have been spotted like a grotesque leper, and the trunks
themselves are twisted almost beyond recognition.  Sickly grey branches
reach down to brush your cheek, almost in a caress that longs for the life
that courses through your body.  You feel the need to leave this forest at
once, however, this abomination extends off into all directions.

A forest in the Blight~
The softness of the ground surprises you here in the Blight.  The trees
that surround you are spindly shadows of their former selves, leafless and
with a sickly gray color that betrays their horrid health.  It seems as if
the trees reach out towards you, looking to suck the vibrant life that your
body still contains.  Occasionally, a leaf buds from a branch, a ghastly
yellow and blotched like a leper.  It is horrifying to behold, and you think
you want to leave here now.

want to call it.  The trees are leafless, giving you the impression that it
is a graveyard arbor that you are walking through.  Stray branches touch
your cheek in what feels like a lover's caress, as if the trees are telling
you that they want you, they want to suck the very marrow of your bones out
of your life giving body.  The corruption in the air makes you sick, and you
decide that you probably want to get out of here.

plants, they seem to creak closer to you, in an effort to smell the life in
your husk, in an effort todrain that life from you.  It heavies your heart
to see anything in this state of corruption, but you must head on, if you do
not want to suffer the same fate.

Here you stand in a forest in the Blight.  The trees about you are
leafless and splotched, as if some foul leprosy has overtaken them.  As you
pass each one, its branches seem to reach down towards you.  At first, it is
simply a touch, then a pinch, then you realize that these foul trees are
trying to grab you and if possible, suck your very existence out of your
husk of a body.  Perhaps it would be wisest if you turned and ran about now.

A desert at the Mountains of Dhoom~
As you top the sand dune underneath your feet, you are confronted with a
startling and awe-inspiring sight.  Before you, a massive range of snow
capped mountains looms.  Judging from the position of the sun and your
corresponding heading, they are probably the Mountains of Dhoom, ancient
border between the Blight and the land of men.  The jagged peaks are not
that now, the Blight has extended and its tentacles reach as far as ever.

Rising over the peak of yet another sand dune, you are suddenly struck
dumb at the sight before you.  Looming large directly ahead are the snow
capped peaks of a massive mountain range.  Judging from the location, they
are most likely the Mountains of Dhoom.  The mountains look almost black
from this distance, and look almost untouched by any weather.  They remain
as jagged as the most nubile range in the land.  The range bars the way any
further south, but allowes you to head both east and west.

As you trudge through the shifting sands of the desert, you come to the
peak of yet another dune, when suddenlt a sight stops your heart.  Looming
directly in front of you is a dark and foreboding mountain range, the
Mountains of Dhoom.  Its jagged peaks are covered with white snow, despite
the temperatures you still feel upon your sticky and wet back.  And they are
black, as black as a starless night.  A breeze coming down from the slopes
gives you some respite from the heat, although its accompanying odor is not
one to savor.

As you cross the rise of yet another sand dune, you are taken aback by
the sudden appearance of a massive mountain range.  The Mountains of Dhoom
if you remember correctly, its jagged black peaks covered with snow, despite
the scalding temperatures that you stand in now.  The range dispels any
notion of continuing further south, however, you can head to the east and
west, or back into the baking desert.

Just to the south of you, a massive mountain range looms.  It has craggy
black peaks covered with a thin layer of snow, and a haze of mist about it
that fills you with a sense of foreboding.  It bars the way to the south
very effectively, you don't think you could travel more than a league into
even the surrounding hillocks.  You can head east and west here, since you
probably don't want to go back into the inferno of the desert.

you had better head east or west and find a way around.

pretty much impassable.  The Mountains of Dhoom are not in the Blight and
are not called by the name Dhoom for no reason.  Perhaps you had better take

leaves of foliage and the shine of free water.  The plants don't look
like anything you've ever seen before, but then again, you are far away
and at this point, anything is an improvement over the raging sands of the
desert.

Like the forest to the east, the trees here are for the most part
leafless.  When a stray leaf does happen to grace a branch, it is spotted
and a sickly yellow shade.  The trees here are spaced a bit further apart,
offering you a glimpse of golden sand dunes off to the west.  Despite the
color, even the sand looks to have some of the taint from the Blight in it.

You stand before a massive forest, or forest graveyard depending on the
way you look at it.  Tall, spindly trees populate the region, trunks grey
and spotted with a sickly black scum.  The few trees that do have leaves are
decrepit, and the leaves look splotchy and sick.  The entire forest screams
of a pain and corruption that no words could ever begin to describe.  It's a
good think you won't have to describe them.

the south is more of the Blight but beyond that, you can make out the line
of Borderforts snaking across the borderlands and the tiny speck of grey
that must be the city of Fal Dara.  Both to the east and west, the Mountains
of Dhoom run on for as far as you can see.

the looks of it and the heat in the air.  Your clothes are already sweated
through, leaving you to smell none to fresh.  The fauna up ahead looks
twisted and corrupted, as if the Blight has taken them and wrenched out
their essence.  From here, you can only head into the jungle, or head back
into the Gap.

as well as the litter of broken arrows, shields, and the bleached white 
of week old bone.  Not only does it look like a battle took place here,
it smells of it.  Perhaps that is what centuries of combat at Tarwin's
Gap leaves behind it.  The ravine continues off both to the north and

one.  Tarwin's Gap runs off to the west here, meandering through the
weaknesses in the mountains.  Fresh slash marks on the rock and numerous
broken arrowheads litter the valley, evidence of a recent battle here.

The Blight at the Mountains of Dhoom~
The Blight reaches the foot of a massive mountain range to the north
here.  From your history and geography lessons, you can only deduce that
those craggy peaks and jet black slopes are the Mountains of Dhoom.  It has
traditionally been the border between the Blight and the Borderlands, but as
time has passed on, the Blight has extended into the ground you now stand
on.

The Blight at the Mountains of Dhoom~
The Blight arrives at the foot of the Mountains of Dhoom here, reaching
right up to its black rocked base.  The peaks of the mountains are partially
shrouded by mists, yet you can see where snow covers some of the jagged and
foreboding peaks.  There is no way into the mountains at this point, as the
slopes are simply too steep and unnegotiable.

The Blight at the Mountains of Dhoom~
A thin, rocky, trail leads the way into the Mountains of Dhoom here.  It
runs diagonally across the surface of a cliff face, traversing back and
forth, but inexorably upwards.  You are not sure you want to walk into 
those monstrous, jagged, black peaks though, it's dangerous enough here
in the Blight.

The Blight at the Mountains of Dhoom~
You have arrived at the base of a massive mountain range, jutting out of
the Blight and reaching up into the mists that shroud its uppermost peaks. 
These are the Mountains of Dhoom, a place where fearsome creatures are
rumored to live.  It is bad enough here in the Blight proper, you wonder how
impossibly difficult the Mountains of Dhoom must be.  Fortunately, you are
not able to enter the Mountains here, saving yourself an agonizing decision.

The Blight at the Mountains of Dhoom~
The Blight ends here, sort of.  In its place is a massive mountain range
that reaches out into the sky, its peaks black and craggy, and slightly
shrouded in mists.  It is rumored that here in the Mountains of Dhoom, there
exist creatures that make even the denizens of the Blight afraid to
approach.  You wonder what sort of monstrosity could instill fear into a
trolloc or a myrrdraal, but since the way north is blocked by a craggy sheer
cliff, you won't have the opportunity to find out.

From stories and legends you have heard, you deduce that these craggy
monstrosities are in fact the Mountains of Dhoom.  Although it is impossible
to enter the mountains here because of the cliff faces that confront you,
you decide that that probably isn't such a bad break after all.

range you have ever seen.  Its black peaks reach up into the sky, reaching
beyond clouds and birds.  The rest of the mountains are craggy and look
virtually impassable.  Not to mention the denizens of the slopes, which in
some stories you have heard, make the creatures of the Blight look like
dancing girls at Feast Day.

The Blight at Tarwin's Gap~
The Blight here arrives at a valley in a massive mountain range.  In more
proper terminology, it would probably be classified as a ravine.  The slopes
of the sides of the ravine are steep cliff faces, impossible to climb up or
down.  A thin ridge runs along the southern edge of the ravine, providing an
excellent defensive position.  From stories you have heard, this is Tarwin's
Gap.

Herot's Crossing~
You stand between two of the largest mountain ranges you have ever seen. 
To the north, the slopes and peaks are jagged and a shade of the deepest
black.  To the east, the slopes are a more traditional brown shade, but have
the same craggy and imposing look as the Mountains of Dhoom to the north. 
It seems as if the mountains did not want to meet each other, and left this
juncture open and flat.  It was here that the Malkier met the trolloc
hordes, and the breaking of the Seven Towers begun.

The Blight~
You stand in a barren field, devoid of any brush, grass, or anything you
might even loosely call foliage.  The color of the hard packed dirt beneath
your feet is a hard deep brown, albeit faded, like a shirt washed once too
many times.  In fact, everything here, from the sun, to the wind in your
hair seems to be the pale shadows of normality, like the essence of life and
nature have been sucked out.

The Blight~
A few stray bits of tumbleweed and a few twigs striving to break out of
the hardpan surface of the deadened ground are all that exists here in the
way of life.  Even those bits however, are faded like bleached clothing,
they seem to lack a life or any sense of entity.  The dull grey horizon and
the occluded horizon add to the impression that, although something may move
here in the Blight, it is certainly not alive.

matches the description.  Everything here seems to be a pale copy of the
original, as if it has all been bleached of life and essence.  A more
disturbing thing is, it continues in every direction you look.

You stand in the Blight, drab and exciting in a way only the Blight can
be.  The sparse foliage and everything else about the place seems faded, as
if all life has been bleached out of them.  In all, it looks like the pale
reflection of the real world.  But another thing that strikes you is how
warm it is here, especially compared to the snowy borderlands.  You loosen
your coat and continue onwards.

with spots of brush and debris.  A tree off to your right is twisted into a
hideous shape, an obvious product of the Blight's horrors.  But what you
notice most of all, is that everything here seems to be a pale mockery of
normality.  The life seems to have been bleached out of everything you see,
from the ground to the tree.

has a distinct and nasty flavor as well.  The Blight runs of in all
directions, much the same in every place you look.

eyesore that makes your heart cry out each time you open it to the outside. 
The few trees that exist here are twisted almost beyond recognition, and the
land itself changes colors between a normal brown, to a putrid urine colored
yellow.  Everything about this place screams sickness, and you long to be
gone from its tainted air.

you would leave it at once.

trunk offers you some minimal protection from the pounding heat of the
Blight.  It is more than the heat however, it is the stickiness in the air
and the entire atmosphere of death and corruption that bothers you.

range, the Spine of the World.  Its peaks reach high up into the clouds,
making it impossible to see exactly how high they really are.  Rain falls
slowly here on this side of the Spine, perhaps that is the cause of the Aiel
Waste that lies just on the other side.

The Blight~
You stand in a vast expanse of not a whole lot.  The land is flat here,
with spots of brush and debris.  A tree off to your right is twisted into a
hideous shape, an obvious product of the Blight's horrors.  But what you
notice most of all, is that everything here seems to be a pale mockery of
normality.  The life seems to have been bleached out of everything you see,
from the ground to the tree.

The Blight~
You stand in a barren field, devoid of any brush, grass, or anything you
might even loosely call foliage.  The color of the hard packed dirt beneath
your feet is a hard deep brown, albeit faded, like a shirt washed once too
many times.  In fact, everything here, from the sun, to the wind in your
hair seems to be the pale shadows of normality, like the essence of life and
nature have been sucked out.

The Blight~
A few stray bits of tumbleweed and a few twigs striving to break out of
the hardpan surface of the deadened ground are all that exists here in the
way of life.  Even those bits however, are faded like bleached clothing,
they seem to lack a life or any sense of entity.  The dull grey horizon and
the occluded horizon add to the impression that, although something may move
here in the Blight, it is certainly not alive.

matches the description.  Everything here seems to be a pale copy of the

disturbing thing is, it continues in every direction you look.

The Blight~
You stand in the Blight, drab and exciting in a way only the Blight can
be.  The sparse foliage and everything else about the place seems faded, as
if all life has been bleached out of them.  In all, it looks like the pale
reflection of the real world.  But another thing that strikes you is how
warm it is here, especially compared to the snowy borderlands.  You loosen
your coat and continue onwards.

The Blight~
You stand in the Blight, a horrid combination of twisted trees, dead
land, putrid air, and foul smelling water.  All in all, you cannot think of
one good thing to say about the rot and sickness that pervades the entire
Blight.  If it were not for the fact that you can see no end to the Blight,
you would leave it at once.

The Blight~
The land you stand on is twisted and the air you breath smells of rot and
plague.  It is impossible to escape from the harsh corruption of the Blight,
as it assails every one of your senses.  Although your heart cries out to
repair the damage done here to the Creator's work, your brain tells you to
leave this foul land at once.

The Blight~
Nobody ever said the Blight was pretty.  In fact, the Blight is a hideous
eyesore that makes your heart cry out each time you open it to the outside. 
The few trees that exist here are twisted almost beyond recognition, and the
land itself changes colors between a normal brown, to a putrid urine colored
yellow.  Everything about this place screams sickness, and you long to be
gone from its tainted air.

This is the Blight, a vast expanse of wasteland.  Everything seems to of

from the land, and replaced with a pile of ashes.  All about you, the Blight
stretches onward.

The Blight~

The land is a barren dusty grey, spotted with sporadic bushes and bits of de
debris.  Everything seems faded here, like the essence has been drained from

Along the Spine of the World~
The mountains to your east dwarf your very existence here in the Blight,
and you wonder just how big those mountains are.  The brown-grey peaks
disappear into think roiling clouds up above, making it impossible for you
to tell for sure how high the Spine is.  In any case, it is impassable, and
you will have to continue your journey in the Blight.

A Borderfort~
You stand at the base of a tall fortresslike tower, made from solid and
stren grey granite.  The rim of the tower is crenellated with arrow slits,
enabling defenders to rain their arrows down upon defenders.  A ramp gently
spirals up the side of the fortress, eventually disappearing into a doorway
on the other side of the tower.  The ramp is also walled and crenelated, yet
another measure of the foresight of the tower's architects.  A massive
mirror has been placed at the very peak of the tower, a signal device to
contact other towers that you can see dotting the Border both to the east
and west.

sky, defending the border from the horros of the north.

differences between the two regions is remarkable.  While to the south the
land is a snowy flatland, the Blight to the north is filled with corruption
and decay.  Both to your east and west, Borderforts rise up out of the
ground, guarding Shienar from trollocs and other nasty monsters.

way.

either carved into the mountains, or the mountains simply forgot to close up
here.  The pass runs north-northeast into the mountains, it is not very high
and looks very negotiable, if a bit rocky and uneven.

borderlands, but the people here in Shienar have learned to persevere.

of snow covers the ground.  The area is criss crossed with small wooden
fences, whose purpose is to mark off farmland, and to slow down any
potential trolloc raids.  The borderlands stretch off here in all
directions, with nothing of note in sight.

Here you stand in another section of the Borderlands.  The land here is
hard as rock, frozen from the long extended winter.  A thin sheen of snow
covers the ground, human and horse tracks alike marked clearly in its frost.
Small, thin fences line the region, demarcating the areas that Shienarian
farmers attempt to ply their trade.  It must be a difficult life, farming in
these conditions.  But then again, so is fighting trollocs.

The land all about here is much the same as you have seen before.  A thin
layer of snow covers the ground, animal and human tracks clearly visible in
its blinding white surface.  Thin fences that used to run all around the
area have been broken down here, and the land seems to be a bit burned
despite the snow covering it.  Probably the result of a trolloc raid you
think, and decide to move on.

breathe in.  The ground is covered with a thin sheen of fine white snow,
remnants of the heart of a winter that should be long past.  This area looks
as if it was once farmland, it may still be, although the Blight and weather
have made it a hardship to endure.

should have long ago melted in any other normal spring.  Small wooden fences
criss cross the land, marking off the land where farmers have struggled to
ply their trade.  From the looks of the land, most have given up their
farming to become soldiers of the land.

The Borderlands~
The borderlands are covered with a thin sheet of brilliant white snow,
snow that should have melted long ago in any normal spring.  Nevertheless,
it is still there, and the land seems to be sleeping and awaiting something.
Perhaps it will be another invasion by the Blight this time, or perhaps it
will be something more.  In any case, the farmers of this land have long ago
sensed the change, and have fled for the cities.

The Borderlands~
You stand here in a thin layer of snow, which in turn lies on top of a
rock hard layer of frozen ground.  This all should have thawed out several
weeks ago, but nevertheless is here.  The residents of Shienar have long
since fled this miserable, frozen plot of land, driven off by trollocs and
the inability to grow a weed, let alone an edible crop.

The Border~
You stand here in the borderlands of Shienar, just a step away from where
the Blight looms heavy.  Snow covers the ground here, and you feel a chill
in your bones that shakes the very roots your teeth stand in.  Apparently,
the people of Shienar have felt that chill, or the sharp pain of a trolloc
canine, for they have left the area, and not a habitant is to be found.

A Borderfort~
You stand at the base of a tall fortresslike tower, made from solid and
stren grey granite.  The rim of the tower is crenellated with arrow slits,
enabling defenders to rain their arrows down upon defenders.  A ramp gently
spirals up the side of the fortress, eventually disappearing into a doorway
on the other side of the tower.  The ramp is also walled and crenelated, yet
another measure of the foresight of the tower's architects.  A massive
mirror has been placed at the very peak of the tower, a signal device to
contact other towers that you can see dotting the Border both to the east
and west.

strong survive.  A thin layer of snow covers the ground here, and thin
fences criss cross the region, marking off the farms of various families. 
You wonder how any farmer can prosper in the short summer here in the
borderlands, but the people here in Shienar have learned to persevere.

The Blight~
You stand in the Blight, a horrid combination of twisted trees, dead
land, putrid air, and foul smelling water.  All in all, you cannot think of
one good thing to say about the rot and sickness that pervades the entire
Blight.  If it were not for the fact that you can see no end to the Blight,
you would leave it at once.

The Blight~
You stand in the Blight, a twisted disaster area of dying trees, living
parasites, and a number of other monsters.  The air is hot and sticky here,
and you feel sick just by breathing in the foul air.  You dare not breathe
through your mouth to avoid the rotting smell in the air, because the air
has a distinct and nasty flavor as well.  The Blight runs of in all
directions, much the same in every place you look.

The Blight~
You stand in the Blight, drab and exciting in a way only the Blight can
be.  The sparse foliage and everything else about the place seems faded, as
if all life has been bleached out of them.  In all, it looks like the pale
reflection of the real world.  But another thing that strikes you is how
warm it is here, especially compared to the snowy borderlands.  You loosen
your coat and continue onwards.

You stand in the Blight, bordered on the east by a massive mountain
range, the Spine of the World.  Its peaks reach high up into the clouds,
making it impossible to see exactly how high they really are.  Rain falls
slowly here on this side of the Spine, perhaps that is the cause of the Aiel
Waste that lies just on the other side.

of the same.  It seems that the Borderlands stretch off in all directions
but always looks the same.

As you trudge through the thin ice caked layer of snow on the ground
here, you begin to wonder if there is any end to this vast expanse of land. 
Although it appears to once have been farmland, it is no longer so, people
driven off by trollocs and livestock eaten.  You know that somewhere off to
the north is the Blight, and that off to the east is the Spine of the World,
and off to the south, Fal Dara and home.

covered in a thin layer of white precipitate, and the wind is numbing both
to your brain and your bones.  As you look around you, you notice that
Shienar is not a place to seek wonderful scenery.  It is much the same as
the land you stand on now.  Snow and more snow and hills and me hills. 
Someone once said that the key to beauty was repetition.  You could probably
prove them wrong from this.

precipitate flows with the contours of the land, up and down hills, flat
where the land is flat.  It is hard to believe that people once populated
this area so close to the Blight.  Apparently, these tough Shienarians have
fled for the relative safety of cities and fortresses.

a wasteland to the untrained eye but closer observation will notice the
small shacks that have been destroyed, the twisted and bent fences running
across the land and the manlike contours of hills.  You realize that this
once must have been fertile farmland.

can only presume that these snow covered hillocks were once a farming area. 
How anyone could farm, or even dare to live this close to the dangers of the
Blight is beyond your comprehension, and you decide to move on.

not longer.  In any case, the scenery all about you looks much the same as

It is hard to keep your bearings straight as you trudge through the ankle
deep snow here in the Borderlands.  For in all directions, the scenery is
much the same.  A fairly flat land covered in white, occasionally crossed by
a long wooden fence, demaracting property.  The area is uninhabited, as if
the residents have fled from the creeping Blight to the relative havens of
the cities.

must dwell in this land, hard like the will of the Dark One, hard like the
monsters who lurk in the Blight to the north.

Your feet grow heavy with each step through the ankle deep now.  You can
only be thankful that you have enough clothing on to protect you from the
biting chill wind that blows on you from the north.  Long, wooden fences
criss cross each other around the surrounding landscape, making you assume
that this area was once farmland.  It is hard to imagine anyone farming in
these conditions, but if anybody could do it, it would be a Shienarian.

cold is the chill that racks your bones.  It seems that this all must have

thin woodern fences criss cross the landscape.

ground, closely clinging to the contours of the region.  At present, the
land looks like a desolate wasteland, but if you look closely enough, you'll
probably come up with the guess that this used to be farmland.

has not yet been taken away.  Somehow you sense that the Blight is extending

range of mountains that reaches high up into the sky, peaks occluded by
cumulous clouds.

potential trolloc raids.  The borderlands stretch off here in all

At first glance, this snow covered region appears to be a wasteland that
has been set here by the Creator simply because he made a mistake.  But upon
closer examination, you begin to realize that this land was once cultivated
by people.  Those residents have been pushed off their land by trollocs, by
myrrdraal, by the cold fingers of Ba'alzamon himself.  The scenery is much
the same in every direction you look, and you begin to despair.

The Borderlands~
The Borderlands are a harsh, snowy land that seems to have endured a
winter twice the normal length.  It is hard to spot any fauna about here, so
cold is the chill that racks your bones.  It seems that this all must have
been farmland at one point, since shacks dot the surrounding area, and long,
thin woodern fences criss cross the landscape.

You stand here in a thin layer of snow, which in turn lies on top of a
rock hard layer of frozen ground.  This all should have thawed out several
weeks ago, but nevertheless is here.  The residents of Shienar have long
since fled this miserable, frozen plot of land, driven off by trollocs and
the inability to grow a weed, let alone an edible crop.

The land all about here is much the same as you have seen before.  A thin
layer of snow covers the ground, animal and human tracks clearly visible in
its blinding white surface.  Thin fences that used to run all around the
area have been broken down here, and the land seems to be a bit burned
despite the snow covering it.  Probably the result of a trolloc raid you
think, and decide to move on.

north, and brave the heat of the Blight.

by people.  Those residents have been pushed off their land by trollocs, by
myrrdraal, by the cold fingers of Ba'alzamon himself.  The scenery is much
the same in every direction you look, and you begin to despair.

You stand in the borderlands, the division between the Light and the

to make you wish you had packed an extra coat.  It is a harsh land, the
ground hard as rock and not a notable landmark in sight in any direction.

You stand in the Borderlands, the northernmost part of the land that is
not the Blight.  The ground is covered with a thin sheen of snow here laced
with ice.  It crunches each time you take a step with one of your booted
feet, it slows you down but is not so tiring.  All around you, you see more
of the same.  It seems that the Borderlands stretch off in all directions
and never look different.

The land around stretches on for all directions, with no change in
terrain in sight.  A thin layer of snow covers the ground, although you can
feel the hardness of the frozen surface beneath you.  The region looks like
a wasteland to the untrained eye but closer observation will notice the
small shacks that have been destroyed, the twisted and bent fences running
across the land and the manlike contours of hills.  You realize that this
once must have been fertile farmland.

Here you stand in another section of the Borderlands.  The land here is
hard as rock, frozen from the long extended winter.  A thin sheen of snow
covers the ground, human and horse tracks alike marked clearly in its frost.
Small, thin fences line the region, demarcating the areas that Shienarian
farmers attempt to ply their trade.  It must be a difficult life, farming in
these conditions.  But then again, so is fighting trollocs.

The borderlands are covered with a thin sheet of brilliant white snow,
snow that should have melted long ago in any normal spring.  Nevertheless,
it is still there, and the land seems to be sleeping and awaiting something.
Perhaps it will be another invasion by the Blight this time, or perhaps it
will be something more.  In any case, the farmers of this land have long ago
sensed the change, and have fled for the cities.

As you trudge through the thin ice caked layer of snow on the ground
here, you begin to wonder if there is any end to this vast expanse of land. 
Although it appears to once have been farmland, it is no longer so, people
driven off by trollocs and livestock eaten.  You know that somewhere off to
the north is the Blight, and that off to the east is the Spine of the World,
and off to the south, Fal Dara and home.

You stand here in the borderlands of Shienar, just a step away from where
the Blight looms heavy.  Snow covers the ground here, and you feel a chill
in your bones that shakes the very roots your teeth stand in.  Apparently,
the people of Shienar have felt that chill, or the sharp pain of a trolloc
canine, for they have left the area, and not a habitant is to be found.

You stand here along the very edge of the Blight, in the borderlands of
Shienar.  The wind here seems unnaturally cold, yet it is refreshing to
breathe in.  The ground is covered with a thin sheen of fine white snow,
remnants of the heart of a winter that should be long past.  This area looks
as if it was once farmland, it may still be, although the Blight and weather
have made it a hardship to endure.

fled for the relative safety of cities and fortresses.

the residents have fled from the creeping Blight to the relative havens of
the cities.

borderlands, but the people here in Shienar have learned to persevere.

Your feet grow heavy with each step through the ankle deep now.  You can
only be thankful that you have enough clothing on to protect you from the
biting chill wind that blows on you from the north.  Long, wooden fences
criss cross each other around the surrounding landscape, making you assume
that this area was once farmland.  It is hard to imagine anyone farming in
these conditions, but if anybody could do it, it would be a Shienarian.

probably come up with the guess that this used to be farmland.

ground, closely clinging to the contours of the region.  At present, the
land looks like a desolate wasteland, but if you look closely enough, you'll
probably come up with the guess that this used to be farmland.

The Borderlands~
Here you are in Shienar, one of the Borderland nations.  The land is
covered in a thin layer of white precipitate, and the wind is numbing both
to your brain and your bones.  As you look around you, you notice that
Shienar is not a place to seek wonderful scenery.  It is much the same as
the land you stand on now.  Snow and more snow and hills and me hills. 
Someone once said that the key to beauty was repetition.  You could probably
prove them wrong from this.

The Borderlands~
As you look around you, you see the same landscape as you have seen many
times before here in the Borderlands.  The land is covered with a thin layer
of snow, and the wind sends a chill through your bones that is not wholly
natural.  The ground is hard underneath the snow, hard like the people who
must dwell in this land, hard like the will of the Dark One, hard like the
monsters who lurk in the Blight to the north.

The Borderlands~
The borderlands are covered with a thin sheet of brilliant white snow,
snow that should have melted long ago in any normal spring.  Nevertheless,
it is still there, and the land seems to be sleeping and awaiting something.
Perhaps it will be another invasion by the Blight this time, or perhaps it
will be something more.  In any case, the farmers of this land have long ago
sensed the change, and have fled for the cities.

Along the Spine of the World~
The land here is where the Borderlands meets up with the Spine of the 
World.  The mountains tower over you to the east, their peaks craggy and 
lost in the clouds, but majestic and awe inspiring to say the least.  
There is no apparent way over the mountains here, so you had better start 
thinking about heading back into the Borderlands again.

You wonder how any farmer can prosper in the short summer here in the
borderlands, but the people here in Shienar have learned to persevere.

You stand here in a thin layer of snow, which in turn lies on top of a
rock hard layer of frozen ground.  This all should have thawed out several
weeks ago, but nevertheless is here.  The residents of Shienar have long
since fled this miserable, frozen plot of land, driven off by trollocs and
the inability to grow a weed, let alone an edible crop.

The land around stretches on for all directions, with no change in
terrain in sight.  A thin layer of snow covers the ground, although you can
feel the hardness of the frozen surface beneath you.  The region looks like
a wasteland to the untrained eye but closer observation will notice the
small shacks that have been destroyed, the twisted and bent fences running
across the land and the manlike contours of hills.  You realize that this
once must have been fertile farmland.

On the road to Fal Dara~
The boredome of the Borderlands is interrupted by the existence of a road
here.  It is a snowy trail more than anything else, but it winds its way up
a large hill to the east.  The hill has been stripped of all vegetation and
has been smoothed, making it hard to climb.  For on top of the hill to the
east is the front gate of Fal Dara, fortress city of Shienar.

Behind Fal Dara~
You stand at the base of a massive hill that seems to flatten out at its
top.  A small staircase has been cut into the side of that hill, allowing
you to climb the otherwise smooth slope with ease.  For at the top of the
plateau, rests the Shienarian fortress city of Fal Dara.  From this angle,
you cannot see much of the city, but it looks imposing, and seems to
dominate the Blight for miles around.

The Borderlands~
This area, like most Borderland regions you have seen in recent days, is
devoid of human habitation.  Apparently, they have fled the onslaught of
trollocs that seems to flood into Shienar with each passing day.  A thin
sheen of snow covers the ground here, making your journey uncomfortable if
not longer.  In any case, the scenery all about you looks much the same as
here, you'll just have to journey on and make the best of things.

As you trudge through the thin ice caked layer of snow on the ground
here, you begin to wonder if there is any end to this vast expanse of land. 
Although it appears to once have been farmland, it is no longer so, people
driven off by trollocs and livestock eaten.  You know that somewhere off to
the north is the Blight, and that off to the east is the Spine of the World,
and off to the south, Fal Dara and home.

potential trolloc raids.  The borderlands stretch off here in all

covers the ground, human and horse tracks alike marked clearly in its frost.
Small, thin fences line the region, demarcating the areas that Shienarian
farmers attempt to ply their trade.  It must be a difficult life, farming in
these conditions.  But then again, so is fighting trollocs.

remnants of the heart of a winter that should be long past.  This area looks
as if it was once farmland, it may still be, although the Blight and weather
have made it a hardship to endure.

need to keep moving to survive in this frigid mess, or you can just head
north, and brave the heat of the Blight.

the residents have fled from the creeping Blight to the relative havens of
the cities.

Along the Spine of the World~
You stand at the base of one of the most awe inspiring mountain ranges 
you have ever laid eyes upon.  The peaks are so incredibly high, that 
they are lost in large, fluffy clouds up over head.  The brown shaded 
mountains are thick with crags and look virtually impassable except to a 
person who can fly.  All in all, it is a magnificent sight.

Here you are in the Borderlands, standing on a rock hard snowy ground and
chilled by the wind in the air.  Just to the north of here, a large hill
rises up out of the ground, flattened on its top and stripped bare of any
vegetation.  It seems to have been smoothed by man's hand, made difficult,
if not impossible to climb.  For sitting on top of the hillock is Fal Dara,
fortress city of Shienar.

area have been broken down here, and the land seems to be a bit burned
despite the snow covering it.  Probably the result of a trolloc raid you
think, and decide to move on.

canine, for they have left the area, and not a habitant is to be found.

The Borderlands are a harsh, snowy land that seems to have endured a
winter twice the normal length.  It is hard to spot any fauna about here, so
cold is the chill that racks your bones.  It seems that this all must have
been farmland at one point, since shacks dot the surrounding area, and long,
thin woodern fences criss cross the landscape.

Your feet grow heavy with each step through the ankle deep now.  You can
only be thankful that you have enough clothing on to protect you from the
biting chill wind that blows on you from the north.  Long, wooden fences
criss cross each other around the surrounding landscape, making you assume
that this area was once farmland.  It is hard to imagine anyone farming in
these conditions, but if anybody could do it, it would be a Shienarian.

must dwell in this land, hard like the will of the Dark One, hard like the
monsters who lurk in the Blight to the north.

Along the Spine of the World~
The land here is where the Borderlands meets up with the Spine of the 
World.  The mountains tower over you to the east, their peaks craggy and 
lost in the clouds, but majestic and awe inspiring to say the least.  
There is no apparent way over the mountains here, so you had better start 
thinking about heading back into the Borderlands again.

The Borderlands~
You stand in the Borderlands of Shienar here, a step away from the Blight
itself.  The land is covered with a thin sheen of powdery white snow, which
should have long ago melted in any other normal spring.  Small wooden fences
criss cross the land, marking off the land where farmers have struggled to
ply their trade.  From the looks of the land, most have given up their
farming to become soldiers of the land.

The Borderlands~
This area, like most Borderland regions you have seen in recent days, is
devoid of human habitation.  Apparently, they have fled the onslaught of
trollocs that seems to flood into Shienar with each passing day.  A thin
sheen of snow covers the ground here, making your journey uncomfortable if
not longer.  In any case, the scenery all about you looks much the same as
here, you'll just have to journey on and make the best of things.

The Borderlands~
You stand here in the borderlands of Shienar, just a step away from where
the Blight looms heavy.  Snow covers the ground here, and you feel a chill
in your bones that shakes the very roots your teeth stand in.  Apparently,
the people of Shienar have felt that chill, or the sharp pain of a trolloc
canine, for they have left the area, and not a habitant is to be found.

The Borderlands~
At first glance, this snow covered region appears to be a wasteland that
has been set here by the Creator simply because he made a mistake.  But upon
closer examination, you begin to realize that this land was once cultivated
by people.  Those residents have been pushed off their land by trollocs, by
myrrdraal, by the cold fingers of Ba'alzamon himself.  The scenery is much
the same in every direction you look, and you begin to despair.

The Borderlands runs off in all directions here, a snow covered mess of
hills and rolling contours.  The air is biting cold here, a chill that
settles deep into the marrows of your bones and the mush in your head.  You
need to keep moving to survive in this frigid mess, or you can just head
north, and brave the heat of the Blight.

You look around and realize with a sinking feeling that as far as you
look, there is no change in the thin layer of snow on the ground or in the
contours of the land.  However, you know for a fact that if you head far
enough north, it will most definitely be different, and not at all this
pleasant.  Nevertheless, you do not like the chill settling in your bones,
so you decide to move on.

As you look about you, you realize with a small sense of despair that the
scenery in this land does not change.  A thin layer of snow covers the
ground, closely clinging to the contours of the region.  At present, the
land looks like a desolate wasteland, but if you look closely enough, you'll
probably come up with the guess that this used to be farmland.

You stand in the Borderlands, the northernmost part of the land that is
not the Blight.  The ground is covered with a thin sheen of snow here laced
with ice.  It crunches each time you take a step with one of your booted
feet, it slows you down but is not so tiring.  All around you, you see more
of the same.  It seems that the Borderlands stretch off in all directions
and never look different.

As you trudge through the thin ice caked layer of snow on the ground
here, you begin to wonder if there is any end to this vast expanse of land. 
Although it appears to once have been farmland, it is no longer so, people
driven off by trollocs and livestock eaten.  You know that somewhere off to
the north is the Blight, and that off to the east is the Spine of the World,
and off to the south, Fal Dara and home.

Here you are in Shienar, one of the Borderland nations.  The land is
covered in a thin layer of white precipitate, and the wind is numbing both
to your brain and your bones.  As you look around you, you notice that
Shienar is not a place to seek wonderful scenery.  It is much the same as
the land you stand on now.  Snow and more snow and hills and me hills. 
Someone once said that the key to beauty was repetition.  You could probably
prove them wrong from this.

The land here is covered with a thin sheet of ice laced snow.  The white
precipitate flows with the contours of the land, up and down hills, flat
where the land is flat.  It is hard to believe that people once populated
this area so close to the Blight.  Apparently, these tough Shienarians have
fled for the relative safety of cities and fortresses.

The land around stretches on for all directions, with no change in
terrain in sight.  A thin layer of snow covers the ground, although you can
feel the hardness of the frozen surface beneath you.  The region looks like
a wasteland to the untrained eye but closer observation will notice the
small shacks that have been destroyed, the twisted and bent fences running
across the land and the manlike contours of hills.  You realize that this
once must have been fertile farmland.

You stand in the Borderlands here in Shienar, a snow covered mess of
rock, dirt and hills.  Thin wooden fences criss cross the region, and you
can only presume that these snow covered hillocks were once a farming area. 
How anyone could farm, or even dare to live this close to the dangers of the
Blight is beyond your comprehension, and you decide to move on.

to the east.  Its jagged peaks are an imposing sight, and they make you feel
small and impotent with all the power they possess.  There isn't too much
else around this area, you'll just have to journey on.

Inside the Borderfort~
You carefully pick your way up the ramp, making sure not to excite any
defenders and get yourself shot.  You can see how defenders could hold
one of these Borderforts against an army ten times their number.  In any
case, you soon arrive at a massive gate roughly three stories above the
ground.  As the gate opens, you are ushered into a medium sized chamber,
which apparently is the entire base camp for the fortress.  Ideal occupancy
here looks to be ten or so men.  A stairway in the side of the undecorated
room heads up to the battlements of the fortress.

was a harsh place, you can see the distinct corruption of the Blight and it

other Borderforts sticking up put of the land, their mirrors also placed in
position to signal other fortresses.

A forest in the Blight~
The forest here is a corrupted shadow of what you might see in most
places.  The leaves have been spotted like a grotesque leper, and the trunks
themselves are twisted almost beyond recognition.  Sickly grey branches
reach down to brush your cheek, almost in a caress that longs for the life
that courses through your body.  You feel the need to leave this forest at
once, however, this abomination extends off into all directions.

A forest in the Blight~
Here you stand in a forest in the Blight.  The trees about you are
leafless and splotched, as if some foul leprosy has overtaken them.  As you
pass each one, its branches seem to reach down towards you.  At first, it is
simply a touch, then a pinch, then you realize that these foul trees are
trying to grab you and if possible, suck your very existence out of your
husk of a body.  Perhaps it would be wisest if you turned and ran away now.

A forest at the Mountains of Dhoom~
You stand here at the base of the Mountains of Dhoom, black peaks
towering over you, and the grey spotted trunks of twisted trees under those.
It is clear to see that from here, you will not be able to cross the
Mountains, so you may as well head back into the forest or follow the
mountains east or west.

A sandy forest at the Mountains of Dhoom~
Like the forest to the east, the trees here are for the most part
leafless.  When a stray leaf does happen to grace a branch, it is spotted
and a sickly yellow shade.  The trees here are spaced a bit further apart,
offering you a glimpse of golden sand dunes off to the west.  Despite the
color, even the sand looks to have some of the taint from the Blight in it.

make out the green leaves of foliage and brush, although from this distance,
they look like no plant you have ever seen.  But they offer shelter from the
beating heat upon your head, and quite possibly, a footing other than the
frustrating shifts of the desert sands.

A desert in the Blight~
The angry heat of the sun beats down upon your head mercilessly as you
trudge through the knee deep sands of the Blight.  It might be easier to
continue onwards if you had a direction to go.  For everywhere you scan, the
desert continues on, seemingly oblivious of your presence, yet deadly still.

A desert at the Mountains of Dhoom~
You try to maintain your footing, but the shifting of the sand dunes
makes it almost impossible to walk with any steady gait.  All about, you are
surrounded by more of the dreaded Blight sand, golden brown and tainted with
the touch of Shaitan.  The orb of fire high in the sky lashes you with its
obscene heat, burning your skin and soaking your clothes in malodorous
sweat.

Niamh Pass~
You stand amidst the Spine of the World, a massive outcropping of brown
grey rock that stretches up into the air as far as you can see. 
Fortunately, the ground here is fairly level albeit a bit rocky.  The pass
runs off to the east, winding its way among massive peaks and fallen
boulders.  The trail is easy to follow, and seems to beckon you onward.

Niamh Pass~
Niamh Pass continues on to the east here.  The elevation here is fairly
high, and you are having trouble catching your breath.  But you had better
do it soon, because you see what may be a rock slide forming up above.  Up
ahead, the trail winds among some boulders that have fallen already.

Niamh Pass~
The Pass has long since started to slope downwards slightly, and now you
think you can see why.  Just ahead is a wasteland not totally unlike that
which you left behind.  Only here, the land is reddish orange in hue and
rocky in nature.  And although the Blight you left behind was warm, it is
simply hot here, and the air dry.  It is only after some thought that you
realize that you are staring at the Aiel Waste.

Thom's Love Shack~
You stand in a small, dusty room that doesn't look like its been cleaned
in quite some time.  Dirty clothes cover the ground and litter the smallish
bed sitting in the corner of the room.  A PowerMac computer rests on top of
an old mahogany desk on the east wall, humming quietly as churns out its
endless string of elaborately descript rooms.  Many a maid has lost their
will in this room, and lost more than that in their process.

A spiral staircase~
The spiral staircase is thin, only wide enough for one person to walk in
it at a time.  It is dark as well, the torches formerly lighting the way
must have been extinguished at some time.  In any case, the voices that you
heard before are stronger here, as if the source is just at the top of this
staircase.  You also smell an odd odor that you can't quite place yet.
