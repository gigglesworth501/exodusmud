auvyron evil mage heretic~
The heretic mage `bAuvyron``~
`bAuvyron, the heretic mage lurks here, preparing to escape his prison.``
~
`aThe Heretic Mage.  The Evil One.  Destroyer of Faiths.  All these
epithets and more too gruesome to tell have been said of this man over the
centuries he has plagued these realms.  Of a medium build, and taller than
most, `bAuvyron `afloats a foot or so off the polished floor.  Dressed in a
`ibloodred `arobe inlaid with sparkling yellow `krunes`a around the hood, he
glows with an otherworldly light.  Of course, you didn't need to know that
this was evil incarnate.  Perhaps the incense that wafts a smell of old,
dried blood across the stifling hot air precludes any thought of redeeming
this man, or reimprisoning him.  Perhaps it is the sight of his `msoul
`achained to the lone supporting pillar.  Perhaps it is this man's eyes,
which are mere pits into a `ksulfurous `ihell`a.

A deranged brother shuffles around the maze here.``

`oThis Brother of Erion was one of the earlier visitors to the `bHell of
Auvyron`o.  As the maze became warped to the evil of Auvyron's soul, some
members of the Abbey entered the maze to try and correct the growing chaos. 
This wretched soul is one example of what happens to those of weak faith
that enter this place.  It is obvious that this monk's  mind has been eaten
away, and his body has been changed to suit Auvyron's purposes.  A
`m`jsnake`o `otongue darts out over drooling lips, and small, dirty brown
scales cover his body.  A feral light enters this abandoned soul's eyes as
you notice him, and he springs at you, trying in vain to exorcise his own
demons.

`dAn amazed Minotaur is here, seeking the lair of `bAuvyron`d.``
~
`dThis hulking beast stands before you, looking as if carved out of the
bole of some gnarled, mountainside tree that was struck by a bolt of
`klightning`d.  He is dressed all in boiled leather, with straps holding
some implements of navigating this maze.  From the pointy horns atop his
flea-bitten head to his slightly cloven hooves, he stands about ten feet
tall.  Some legends would have it that this beast is little more than a
brute, killing machine, but there seems to be a glint of cunning and purpose
in his yellowed eyes.

`aAs more and more of the lifeforce of Auvyron was expended in the
corrputing of his prison, he finally broke down and set his soul itself to
wander the maze alone, searching for those who would thwart its master's
plans.  On this plane, it does not even exist, but instead, `lpervades
`athis place.  It shows itself in the slight deadening of drips of water, in
the cruel lifelesness of the air, and mirrored in the deeps of the mad, mad
sky.

A transformed novice is here, a sorry amalgam of chaotic parts.

`lPeople who fail to complete the `bHell of Auvyron `ltend to end up
looking like this.  After wandering the maze for uncounted time, the chaos
took its effect on this once humble novice, transforming him into the
monstrosity you see before you.  `jLime green `lfins sprout from his back,
and flaming, `iruby red `leyes jut from this piteous soul's elongated face. 
Dressed in a dark, `asoot-colored `lcloak and hood, he avoids joining with
his former brethren in singing their praises to their new master,
`bAuvyron`l.  ``

`lOne of the first extraplanar excursions `bAuvyron `ltook after escaping
from the forces of the `kArgent Lance `lwas to the fiery plane of
`iNalaxos`l.  The inhabitants of that place are demons, and the very few
tales that have come out of that place, usually shared by retired mages in
the shadows and warmth of the mage guild, are that the denizens look like a
cross between a jellyfish and a she-wolf.  In exchange for some of their
people's aid in conquering his prison, `bAuvyron `lpromised them mortal
hosts.  This demon floats through the air lazily, as if surveying prey,
possibly you.

`oThis creature was once a hideous `aVro'ath `owho came to pledge his
services to the heretic mage, `bAuvyron`o.  True to his evil nature, the
beast was immediately chosen to receive a `iN`ca`il`ca`ix`ci`in`o spirit
into his body.  Unfortunately, `bAuvyron`o did not ponder the possibility
that the melding of beast and demonic spirit would not take.  The sorry
result of this you see before you.  Standing around twelve feet tall, and
covered in a phosphorescent orange goo, it sprouts both limp tentacles from
its upper arms and a row of thorny spikes that jut from its spinal column. 
Alternately writhing on the floor in pain and striking itself with a bared
fist, this is not a creature anyone in their right mind should approach.

`gThis noble bird of prey once roamed the skies above `bAuvyron's

subsequently experimented on those unfortunate enough to survive.  This
malign beast is one example.  It radiates the stench of evil, and its most
evident feature is a large third eye centered in its forehead.  It seems to
be wounded: twisted out of its natural cycle to become a fearsome reminder
of the power of evil.  It flaps heavily toward you, tormented but deadly.

was one of the few lucky ones who survived the `bAuvyron `lcampaign.  The
sights he witnessed during those heroic days, from `ifire `lflowing like
water to stalk and kill his troops to the End of things Holy, as the daemon
`kZatel`l opened the Gate of Sorrow changed him forever.  He retired to this
place and this duty: To ward the prison of `bAuvyron`l against those who
would open it as long as he lived.  He wears the `hwhite`l robes of the
Erion Order, and the `gazure`l cloak and `ablack steel`l gauntlets of a
paladin.  He still carries his heft well, but his tonsure is rimed with a
`osilver frost`l, showing his age.

`kA demigod in her own right, Malrezni chose to give up some of her

unbounded for those who would thwart his designs, `bAuvyron's`k first move
was to enchain this blissful spirit within the `apillar`k that until
recently housed his `msoul`k.  Only the weakening of `bAuvyron's`k spirit
allowed her to reach this plane, so what you can see is more dreamlike than
not.  She still has no form; just a presence: The majesty of a
`gs`at`eo`gr`am`a-`ei`gn`af`el`ga`am`ee`ad`k ocean, the peace of an old
churchyard, the love that the eternal `cForest`k feels for its Rangers.

shambling beast~
`dA shambling beast``~
`dAnother denizen of `bThe Hell of Auvyron `dslumps toward you.``
~
`dAnother one of `bAuvyron's`d creations shambles toward you.  It could
be nearly anything.  It's really big, and seems to be made of mud that was
shaped with an eye towards unholiness.  To allow this construct to move, its
joints have been animated with an evil `jgreen`d light.  Its approach makes
the ground shake as it shambles toward you.

`bA Transformed Novice``~
A transformed novice is here, a sorry amalgam of chaotic parts.
~
`lPeople who fail to complete the `bHell of Auvyron `ltend to end up
looking like this.  After wandering the maze for uncounted time, the chaos
took its effect on this once humble novice, transforming him into the
monstrosity you see before you.  `jLime green `lfins sprout from his back,
and flaming, `iruby red `leyes jut from this piteous soul's elongated face. 
Dressed in a dark, `asoot-colored `lcloak and hood, he avoids joining with
his former brethren in singing their praises to their new master,
`bAuvyron`l.  ``

`aResurrected Bones``~
`aA `ihellish`a construct of old, blasted death is here.``
~
`aThis jumbled pile of bones makes a quiet clicking sound as it
approaches.  Created by the power of evil, it seems to have the snout and
fangs of a wolf, the tail of some long-dead lizard, the legs of an elephant,
and the torso of a human.  Sickly `mpurple`a light plays about its skeletal
joints, providing not only motive power, but freedom of movement to crush
the foes of `bAuvyron`a.  ``

`lA glowing orb``~
`lA `kglowing`l orb floats here, displaying shimmering fractal patterns.
~
One of the strangest sights in this unholy place, a smallish ball of some
shiny metal floats just out of reach.  Imprinted all over its surface with
tiny, glinting runes that ebb and flow in fractal patterns, mesmerizing even
the most pensive person.  At first glance, these glowing spheres might be
taken as lights, but the thought that goes into the creation of the patterns
whorling on the surface of these things requires sentience.

`gA `jmad`g shrike is here, glaring at you cunningly.``
~
`gThis noble bird of prey once roamed the skies above `bAuvyron's`g
prison.  Upon his escape, however, `bAuvyron`g managed to lure a small
fraction of the animal life placed into his prison into his laboratory, and
subsequently experimented on those unfortunate enough to survive.  This
malign beast is one example.  It radiates the stench of evil, and its most
evident feature is a large third eye centered in its forehead.  It seems to
be wounded: twisted out of its natural cycle to become a fearsome reminder
of the power of evil.  It flaps heavily toward you, tormented but deadly.

its middle so that those denizens of Auvyron who must travel his jail
quickly can ride on it.  It manages to move by extending part of itself
forward, and retracting itself behind, almost as if pouring itself out in a
sickening fashion.  It's smell reeks of rot, dirt, and some synthetic,
unnatural odor.

`dPits such as these are the result of the evil that is `bAu`lv`byron`d

`kThe Despair of the Holy``~
`dThe evils of the heretic mage `bAuvyron `dhave warped this place almost
beyond recognition.  This place, like most of the others here, is
nightmarish.  `dSome twisted, misshapen `ctrees `dseem `d to writhe with the
torments that only a man that has defied all that is holy can inflict.  The
very Earth groans and cries out in torment, as evidenced by smoking pits
filled with `jglowing green `dacid, and `ifires `dthat spring out of the
ground without notice.  Every path seems similar, for that is the nature of
the Maze of Auvyron, and all lack any glimmer of hope.

`cThe Creator's Tears``~
`nEven in the air above Auvyron's Hell, the carnage is little different
than that below.  Mad streaks of `fpurple `nand`n `kgold `nshow that Auvyron has
tried to break his prison using his considerable magical skills.  Thick,
`ametallic `nclouds scud from horizon to horizon, blown by ill, unnatural
winds.  The stink of evil is heavy up this high, `nand`n twisted birds of
unknown origin, some sprouting three eyes, or extra beaks, dot the sky. 
Even from this great vantage, the magics that built this place warp any
sense of direction, or perspective, making all paths seem one.

`aThe clouds that fill the sky are no puffy, lazy afternoon in the fields
kind of clouds.  These are the physical manifes`lt`aations of `bAuvyron's`a
hate, present in this benighted world in the form of thick, sludgy nimbus
formations.  The bottoms of these unpleasant things nearly touch your head,
and look like they might rain enough toxicity to kill any life that is able
to survive the more general corruption in this place.

bird~
`nSome of the pseudo-avian life that frequents the higher realms of the
maze can be viewed by t`lh`nose intrepid (or stupid) enough to wait.  All of
the typical songbirds found in shady trees back in the lighted realms above
are here twisted into killing, stunted shapes.  Murderously sharp beaks,
sharpened talons, and huge wingspans are frequent, and some of them seem
large enough to carry off a full-grown ox.

warm, and inviting by the Bro`lt`fhers of Erion so that `bAuvyron`f could
recall the simple comforts of life in his prison, he quickly corrupted it to

`kThe `iLast `kChance``~
`cThis rather bland room acts as a haven for those about to challenge
`bAuvyron's Hell`c```c.  Soft, verdant grass carpets the floor, and there is a
natural light here, shining from a few cunningly placed refractive mirrors`c. 
A huge, `agray steel `cdoor is planted deep into the north wall`c.  Its
mechanism consists of a rusty winch that seems to be frozen solid`c. 
Unfortunately, that is not the case, for there is a Brother here who shakes
his head foolishly at your request for entry to the maze`c.

its brilliant finish is etched in `kholy`a runes the `iSeal of Galnorin`a. 
This seal is said to contain the spell that keeps Auvyron in this place, so
perhaps it would not be a good idea to mar this blessed work with your grimy
hands.  ``

`nGalnorin's Mercenaries for Hire``~
`nA `kholy `nfeeling of peace and contentment wash over your body as you
enter this small shop.  A rough wooden counter divides the room neatly in
half, and the low mutter of soldiers emanates from a passage to the east. 
The legend has it that Galnorin was one of the original creators if the
`iHell of Auvyron`n, and retired to this spot soon afterwards to provide
solace and assistance to those intrepid enough to brave this place of
madness.  Galnorin taps his pipe out on the counter and gestures vaguely at
the back room, where low calls for wenches or ale can be heard.  ``

`kA Return to Normalcy``~
`lTaking a small break from the `ihell `lsurrounding this place, you duck
into a welcoming tent that has been erected over one of the spots that the
Brothers of Erion Abbey have been able to exert their mastery over, wresting
it from the heretic mage `bAuvyron`l.  The proprietoress, a young syvin named
Elanor, was selected by the masters of the Abbey to descend into this place
and aid those brave enough to reach this far into the maze.  To this end,
she protects this place with her magics, and sells magical items to
adventurers who must shoulder their packs and trudge back into the madness
of the maze.

`aThe Vestibule of `bAuvyron``~
`aAfter the wearing madness of the `bHell of Auvyron `a, this place seems
slightly confusing.  `a Calm, gray stone spirals up out of view overhead,
and the sheer precision of this place suggests the keen intellect of a
madman.  The walls and floor betray no fault of craftsmanship, and no wear,
as if time slows to a crawl in this place while the world falls into ruins
in the outside world.  `lI`aron sconces placed high up overhead and filled
with scented candles cast bewildering shadows over all four walls. 
Stretching from floor to ceiling in the middle of this room is an ancient
pillar of volcanic rock, scored with time and the strain of holding the
`msoul`a of `bAuvyron`a.  Its evil glow reaches out for your own soul and
gently tugs at it, pulling you physically forward.  ``

`bThe `iHell `bof Auvyron``~
`aThis egg-shaped chamber in the heart of the maze was where `bAuvyron
`awas originally imprisoned.  Once being captured in secret so many years
ago, he was spirited underground to this place and his `msoul`a (or what was
left of it at that time) was nailed into one of the stone pillars that form
the supports for the roof using nails specially prepared for this event.  As
the years passed, `bAuvyron `awas able to expand his spirit and affect the
reality of his immediate surroundings.  Unfortunately, it left his `msoul`a
bound to the gutrock of the Earth, where it could in time warp the reality
of this place, imposed by holy prayer and the order set forth by the Creator
herself. A low dias has been set up in the far end of the chamber,
for this is the place that the dread `bAuvyron `alurks, in waiting for those
brave few who would dare challenge his greatness.

`kMithra's Respite``~
`cThis is where Mithra pops into when he's tired of building cool areas
for ungrateful lv 90s on the live port.  An acoustically perfect sound
system plays Perahia's version of Bach's 'Goldberg Variations' at a medium
volume in a corner.  A comfy overstuffed brown leather chair with matching
ottoman sits in another corner next to a short bookcase full of his favorite
books (ask for details!)  A pair of wrought iron candlesticks sit high up on
the wall, full of a liquid fiery substance, perfect for throwing a calm
light into the chamber.  The only other decorations are a few Maxfield
Parrish prints hanging on the wall.  A huge mahogany desk dominates this
place, overspilling with maps, graph paper, colored and regular pencils, and
anything else that will spark Mithra's imagination.
