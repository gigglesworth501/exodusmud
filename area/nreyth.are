huge vroath vro'ath auctioneer~
`othe slave `kauctioneer``~
A huge Vro'ath stands here, talking too fast for you to understand.
~
Like most other Vro'aths, this man is huge and brawny.  He wears a
sleeveless, tight-fitting vest.  Indifferent to the sobs and moans of the
slaves around him, he jerks roughly on their chains as he brings them onto
the auction block.  Surprisingly, he conducts these auctions with competence
and speaks in a quick, crisp manner.

This man wears only a rough loin-cloth to protect his privacy.  His body
is left bare for the slave buyers to evaluate.  Welts and scars cover a
fairly impressive physique, most likely developed from months, probably
years, of constant toil.

Age among the Vro'aths cannot diminish the more prominent aspects of
their features.  Aspects which inspire horror and fear into other races. 
Even at her advanced age, this elder Vro'ath still commands respect with her
great size and a face that only the courageous would look up twice.  Her
work does not please her, but she conducts slave registrations in an
efficient manner, glaring at those who dwaddle or take their time her

consecrated to Ne'shajh when the Vro'aths settled in Nre'yth, is second in
importance only to the duties of the High Priest.  Many years of experience,
some on the battlefield, has given Lr'thon the reputation of being one of
the wisest among his race.  Many come to him to seek healing and guidance.

`nSzerla the Church Secretary``~
`nA young priestess, newly appointed to her duties as Church Secretary, studies some financial documents intently.``
~
Tall and stately, this young Vro'ath lady has quite a reputation for
beauty among her kind.  Quite the opposite of petite, Szerla possesses more
than enough pleasing curves to capture the hearts and minds of all young
(and some not so young) Vro'ath males.  She also has a keen, analytical
mind, something that comes among Vro'aths once every few generations. 
Barely past her twentieth year, she is already given the difficult task of
managing the Vro'ath Church's finances.  Her uncle, the High Priest
il'Reshaz himself, relies heavily upon her to deal with the many mundane
details of running the Church.  Szerla is also the pride of her father,
General Mush'zyl, one of the few military leaders in Nre'yth on good terms
with the clergy.

`fGren'yar the Headmaster of the school is here reading over some reports.``
~
Even for a Vro'ath, Gren'yar is an imposing figure.  The room seems
almost too small to fit him.  Unlike other mages among his race, he did not
chose to study the arcane arts because he was unsuited for a warrior's life.
The way he moves suggests that he could be more that just a competent
opponent in physical combat.  His abilities in magic, by no means
spectacular, are nothing to laugh about either.  After all, he did not get
his position of Master Mage among the Vro'aths by fumbling on every other
spell.

maintenance engineer vro'ath~
A maintenance engineer~
A vro'ath maintenance engineer is here, sweeping up animal excrement from the streets.
~
One of the less fortunate, this Vro'ath has been delegated the life long
task of cleaning up horse and bull excrement from the Nreyth streets. 
However, as all Vro'ath accept their life tasks as the will of their god, he
does not seem to perturbed to be doing it.

animal feeder~
An animal feeder~
A grungy human figure crouches here, focused solely on the caretaking of the animals.
~
You cannot even tell what sex the human figure crouched in front of you
is, it is so downtrodden and forlorn, with misstrewn hair hanging all about.
The figure carries a big grain sack, almost as large as its body, ostensibly
to feed the mammoth like creatures nearby.

woman housewife~
A housewife~
A harried housewife hurries by, on one of the many chores she has to accomplish today.
~
A vro'ath housewife rushes by, almost completely oblivious to your
unimportant existence.  Many bundles burden her arms, as she rushes on her
way to her many appointments, errands, and chores for the day.

vro'ath noble~
A Vro'ath noble~
A richly dressed noble hurries by, probably on the way to an important meeting.
~
Garishly dressed in green and purple tones, you observe that just because
a Vro'ath might possess wealth, good taste and decor does not necessarily
automatically this.  The noble before you brushes by you rather rudely as he
walks by hurriedly.  You imagine he probably has wars to plan, or countries
to take over.

The prophet~
An aged Vro'ath with lengthy silver hair mumbles prophecies to passersby.
~
A stooped, aged Vro'ath approaches you with an intense gleam in his eyes.
His long silvery hair sways back and forth about his shoulders, slighty
disheveled, but altogether appropriate for one spouting odd missives about
the world.  You step back, trying to avoid this strange creature, but to no
avail.

A vro'ath stablemaster~
Gn'rukk the stablemaster stands here in a suit behind a counter waiting to sell you some well worn supplies.
~
Gn'rukk is dressed well in a suit that he obviously got from Samuel the
clothier in Thesden.  They are extremely well made of silks and cottons. 
Not at all like the cheap materials that most vro'aths wear.  He sells
various items for the vro'aths that like to ride horses, not eat them.

Sleeping Quarters~
More single beds fill this room.  As is the Vro'ath way, the beds are
lined up in short, straight rows.  Made to last long and to stiffen some
backs, those beds are far from comfortable.  Yet, sleeping on the ground
would be worse, though not by much.  Smells of food come from the west.

Sleeping Quarters~
The beds in this room are arranged in short, neat rows.  Each bed looks
barely large enough to fit one person, especially considering the size of a
Vro'ath.  Even with the tight, regular schedules that the soldiers have to
keep, there are always beds that are occupied, day or night.  Thus, quiet in
this room is rare, as sleeping soldiers do not care for the ears of others.

Barracks~
This building was meant as a place for soldiers to sleep and nothing
more.  In the minds of the Vro'ath military leaders, comfort and luxury can
only lead to laxity in discipline and erosion of combat effectiveness.  The
measures taken to prevent this from happening can be seen in this room.  All
the soldiers are expected to either sleep upon the simple, stiff beds or
sleep on the ground.  Sounds of discussion come from behind the door to the
west.

Lowegk Path~
Lowegk Path slices a neat east-west line across the city.  A fierce gust
of biting wind makes you wish that you had worn an extra cloak.  The
Vro'aths you see are lightly dressed, but they do not seem to mind the cold.
Most of the foreigner travelers appear slightly uncomfortable, but some had
the prudence to bring some thick clothing.  Fortunately for you, there is a
clothing shop to the north.

Lowegk Path~
Lowegk Path slices a neat east-west line across the city.  You are near
the busy core of Nre'yth.  To the south you see some typical stone homes of
the Vro'ath.  Sounds of a busy intersection come from the east.  The jarring
rings of steel hitting steel emanate from a smelly shop on the north side of
the street.

Lowegk Path~
Lowegk Path slices a neat east-west line across the city.  The houses on
the north side of the street look fairly new.  However, you cannot be
certain since Vro'ath architecture is by no means innovative or creative. 
Only the smooth, clean stone walls of the buildings give an indication that
they were recently built.

Lowegk Path~
Lowegk Path proceeds through a residential district.  Vro'ath homes were
never known for their beauty or even having any semblance of grace.  Those
squat, blocky houses on the street's north side are not so much ugly as they
are painfully dull.  Nevertheless, those buildings appear sturdy enough to
last for centuries.

Lowegk Path at Hrathn Street~
Located in the middle of a residential neighborhood, this intersection is
usually quiet.  Most of the houses near here are plain stone constructions. 
Anything less would be unfit for the average citizen of this city.  However,
homes to the south are of inferior quality and suggest that those residents
there are among the poor of the city's population.  Lowegk Path cuts east
and west, while Hrathn Street runs north and south.

Lowegk Path~
Lowegk Path cuts east and west across the city.  It passes through a
somewhat quiet neighborhood.  Houses on both sides of the street show the
usual Vro'ath lack of creativity.  The wooden homes crowded together to the
south look out of place in a city mainly constructed of stone.  An
intersection is close by to the west.

Lowegk Path~
Lowegk Path slices a neat east-west line across the city.  The fence to
the north encloses a large pen full of large, woolly quadrupeds - possibly
cousins of the bighorn sheep.  These animals are called "mi'enkhrn" by the
Vro'aths.  Mi'enkhrn provide wool and food for the city's residents.  The
task of herding and caring for these beasts belongs to some human slaves. 
This street continues west and ends at an intersection to the east.

Barracks Lounge~
When not sleeping or eating, soldiers come here to rest, talk with
others, or just lose themselves in whatever simple thoughts they have.  The
few seats available are usually occupied by the senior veterans.  Others sit
on the floor or stand against the walls.  The walls are covered with papers
detailing assignments and guard duties.  Several of the newer members to the
military service are busy showing off in arm-wrestling matches upon the few
tables in the room.

Jeghk's Birds and Beasts~
The smell of dirt and waste permeates the main room of this pet store. 
The stone building looks much like the other buildings in the city.  Chains
protrude from the walls and leftover foods are strewn about the floor making
it difficult for anyone to walk past the front desk.  The cages are filled
with pets that look like human at a distance.  They vary in color, size, and
waste.  Upon closer inspection, the pets have odd characteristics that
humans do not.  The humanoids are naked and caked with a combination of mud
and blood.  They begin whimpering, a sound that only a that only a vro'ath
would be amused by.

`dThe Sleepy Bear Inn``~
You stand in a large, poorly lit room.  Dark brown fur rugs on the floor
does not help in making the room any brighter.  From the name of this place,
you would guess that those rugs were donated by some unfortunate bears.  The
heads of some more ursine victims proudly decorate two of the walls.  Behind
a huge wooden counter stands a elder innkeeper, ready to give you the key to
your room or doze off.  The room to the north is marked, `o"Double
Occupancy."  `lA hallway leads east, to the inn's other rooms.  ``

`fGurshar's Bar``~
`gRaucous laughter fills your ears as you enter this room.  Unlike some
other drinking establishments, there is no music playing softly in the
background.  Besides the laughter, you hear several conversations going on
at once, some louder and more heated than others.  Standing behind the bar
is a lean-faced Vro'ath, taller than most other Vro'aths you have seen, but
not as massive perhaps.  The shelves behind him are stocked full of bottles,
flasks, jugs, and other containers of alcoholic beverages.

Gruk Street~
Running north and south, Gruk Street passes directly in front of the
Nre'yth Martial Academy.  Like most Vro'ath buildings, this military
institution is contructed from sturdy stone.  The triagonal war banners of
the various legions of soldiers currently assigned to Nre'yth flutter weakly
from the roof.  New and veteran members of those legions pass through the
entrance to the west many times each day.

Wistarg's Armoury~
The heat from the forges at the rear of the room hammers into you as you
enter.  Several huge bodies, human slaves and Vro'aths, stand near the
forges pumping the bellows.  Away from the forges, thick-armed smiths are
methodically pounding red-hot chunks of metal into more useful forms -
weapons.  Various examples of their finished work are displayed throughout
the shop - thick broadswords, double-edged axes, and heavy lances.  The
shop's owner stands behind a counter critically examining a newly finished
piece.  A small `osign `lis posted on the counter.  ``

Double Occupancy Room~
This is easily the best room of the inn.  Besides being spacious, the
room has two windows which provide more than adequate lighting during the
day.  A large, simple bed with enough room even for two Vro'aths stands
against the room's eastern wall.  On the opposite wall stands a wooden
closet for clothing.  Near the closet sits a sturdy table made of some
wood-like material.  A comfortable looking chair has been placed next to the
table.  At the far corner of the room, there is a small washstand and a
basin of clean water.

Talir Street~
The westernmost street of Nre'yth maintains a steady north-south course. 
Passing by some of the city's larger houses, the road is the last stretch of
smooth stone before the rough, jagged slopes of Aven Talir to the west. 
Those houses stand slightly apart, as if their separation would somehow mask
the many similarities that they share.  You see that more of these same
stone buildings line the east side of the street to the north.

Gruk Street~
Gruk Street passes through a wealthy section of Nre'yth.  The larger size
of the houses to west reflects the greater wealth of their owners.  However,
besides the size, these homes look not much different from others you have
seen in the city.  The Vro'ath obsession with building in only straight
lines and right angles goes to the point of absurdity.  It is no surprise
then, that even the richer citizens have these boring, blocky houses.

Service Hallway~
This darkened hallway leads to the inn's cheaper rooms.  Here is also
where some maids, possibly human slaves, do their work.  Buckets half-filled
with murky water and old, dirty mops stand unused in a corner as the maids
are busy dusting and wiping the walls.  To the west, you see the front of
the inn.  North and east are a couple of bedrooms.

weary traveler.  The largest piece of furniture in the room is a simple bed,
just barely large enough to fit an average Vro'ath.  A small window looks
east.  At the opposite end of the room stands a sturdy black table.  Placed
near the table is a chair covered with some soft woolen material.

`hThe soft white of the walls in this room creates a relaxing atmosphere.
Paintings of various snowscapes, none of which could be called a
masterpiece, hang from the wall opposite to the inn's entrance.  A plump
Vro'ath woman, age indeterminate, stands in front of this wall and behind a
counter from which she is taking requests for rooms.  To the south, you see
a common dining area for the inn.  The room to the north is marked,
`o"Double Occupancy".  ``

This is the best room that this inn has to offer.  Spacious and well-lit
by two windows, the room may even be considered luxurious by Vro'ath
standards.  A huge bed, which can easily fit two Vro'aths, dominates the
furniture in the room.  Against the west wall of the room, there is a closet
for any clothing that the room's occupants may have.  Near the closet sits a
black table, unattractive but sturdy and clean.  To complement the table,
there is a comfortable chair covered with soft wool.  Finally, in a lonely
corner of the room, there is a washstand and a clean basin of water.

Dining Room~
`dThroughout the day, about half of the dozen or so tables in this room are
occupied by the inn's patrons, mainly foreign travelers.  Pockets of
conversation buzz quietly at the various tables.  At one corner of the room,
a burly cook prepares meals and dispenses them efficiently to the serving
girls who wait upon the inn's customers.  The food does not appear to be
gourmet quality, but no one seems to be complaining about it either; at
least not within hearing range of the muscular Vro'ath cook.  A staircase at
the south end of the room leads up to the inn's second floor.  The entrance
to the inn lies north.

This room is by no means luxurious, but it does provide a place of rest,
which is all that a weary traveler needs.  The main piece of furniture in
the room is a sturdy bed that looks to be too hard to be comfortable. 
Still, it is better than sleeping on cold, hard ground and under a blanket
of stars.  The only window in the room is a small one that looks east.  A
dark brown table of hardwood stands near the window.  Placed next to the
table is a chair covered with soft wool.

Nre'yth Martial Academy~
You stand in a spacious and relatively empty foyer.  The wall opposite to
the building's entrance is adorned with martial artwork.  All the paintings
show scenes of intense, bloody combat or triumphant conquests of the
Vro'aths.  Next to the wall are life-sized sculptures of various military
leaders, all standing in dignified and commanding poses.  The hallway leads
north and south.

Second Floor Hallway~
Unlike the hallway on the first floor, this hallway is unadorned.  The
pale white walls are diligently kept clean.  This floor is primarily the
domain of higher ranking officers of the Vro'ath Legions.  Marshal
Torqenuk's office is behind the door to the north.  His generals use the
room to the west to plot their strategies.

A Long Corridor~
This hallway leads to the busier section of the academy.  To the north
and east, you hear the steady, droning voices of officers lecturing to their
students.  Behind the door to the west is the school's training field.  You
can clearly hear the crisply barked commands of the drilling officers. 
South is the entrance foyer to the academy.

Officers' Hallway~
This quieter section of the hallway houses the rooms of the academy's
officers.  Cadets walk past here briskly, yet carefully and quietly also. 
None of them show signs of resenting the stern military discipline that they
live under, but they are not eager to incur the displeasure of their
superiors either.  Whenever an officer does walk by, all the cadets stand to
attention, waiting to be ordered.  The hallway makes a turn to the west and
leads north to the entrance of the academy.

Training Field~
Dirt covers the ground here, but it has been packed so densely that the
field has the texture of a stone paved road.  The daily trampling of many
heavy feet has snuffed out all plant life, except for a few clumps of weeds.
Many young Vro'ath cadets, all standing in neat rows, strive to keep up with
the commands of their drilling officer.  This aging officer has had decades
of combat experience and allows almost no margin of error to his students. 
Yet, the cadets are so well trained that he seldom has to mete out
punishment.  The field extends to the south.  A door to the east leads into
the hallways and classrooms of the academy.

Training Field~
This densely packed dirt field has been worn flat by the passage of many
feet.  Even grass does not grow on this stone hard ground; only a few clumps
of weeds manage to eke out a stubborn existence.  Looking around, you see
young Vro'ath males positioned neatly in several groups, each group engaged
in some sort of combat drill.  Their instructors scrutinize the activity,
occasionally correcting the cadets' mistakes with sharp commands.  This
training field extends north.  There is a door leading south into the
academy building.

This part of the academy is where the cadets go for the brief periods of
rest that they are allowed.  Looking through a couple of open doorways, you
see that the sleeping quarters are nothing more than small rooms packed with
beds.  Sleepy cadets searching for their beds are too tired to notice your
presence.  To the east, this quiet hallway makes a turn.  A heavy door to
the north provides an exit to this building.

Office of the Marshal~
`aFrom this room, the Marshal of Nre'yth administers the affairs of the
academy and the city.  A true military leader, Marshal Torqenuk has
strategic maps posted on all the walls of his room.  Reports from
subordinate officers, neatly arranged on a heavy ironwood table, await his
perusal.  A large undecorated chair, also made of ironwood, does not look
like a comfortable seat but has served Vro'ath leaders since the city's
founding.

Even the higher ranking officers of the Vro'ath Legions do not spare
themselves much luxury.  This room is dominated by a large rectangular stone
table, upon which are various maps, documents, and reports.  A huge,
detailed map of the city and the surrounding area is pinned upon one wall. 
Several chairs are available, but only the ignorant or foolish would dare to
sit upon seats reserved for the Vro'ath military's high command.  Other
walls have more maps pinned on them, but the areas that they show are
unfamilar to you.

`hSmooth stone columns support a roof that is at least twenty feet above
the ground.  Engravings of strange and terrible beasts, the primary elements
of Vro'ath mythology, decorate the roof.  Many of them seem very life-like
as they stare down hideously at passers-by.  To the east, you can see robed
priests attending to a large stone altar.  Sickening smells of burning flesh
also come from that direction.  A wide hallway extends north and south. 
West leads outside the temple, to Hrathn Street.``

Prayer Room~
`aIllumination is dim in this quiet room.  The `owhite-washed`a walls are
starkly clean and devoid of any markings.  Several mats are arranged on the
floor, in no apparent order or pattern.  A few of the mats are occupied by
younger priests, eyes closed and deep in contemplative meditation.  An older
priest stands near a small altar, performing some ritual of blessing or
cursing, depending on if one is a Vro'ath or not.``

`aAltar of `bBlood `aand `iFire``~
`iAn imposing black stone altar dominates this room.  Like a ravenous
beast, the constantly burning fire on the altar devours the sacrifices that
priests offer at regular intervals.  A huge, black iron mask hangs from the
ceiling, barely out of reach of the licking flames below.  Many non-Vro'aths
mistakenly assume that this grotesque image is the Vro'aths' conception of
their dark god.  However, this gruesome visage is not the actual appearance
of Ne'shajh, but is an image used by early priests to frighten followers and
opponents of the Vro'ath religion.  No mortal eyes can survive a glimpse of
Ne'shajh's true face.  To the east and west, you can see more of the temple.
The High Priest's room lies behind the door to the north.  ``

A Darkened Basement~
Dim lighting in this dank chamber almost conceal numerous heavy steel
chests.  All those chests appear to be closed and securely locked.  Whatever
they contain makes them heavy enough to resist your futile attempts to budge
them.  A few torches on the walls flicker feebly, creating dancing shadows
as you move around the room.  Even the weak light from those torches show
that this room has not been neglected or forgotten.  Dust is absent from the
floor or chests, and the metallic locks on the chests have no hints of rust.

Chamber of Acolytes~
`bThe walls of this large room are covered entirely with scenes of
struggle and triumph for the Vro'ath Church.  Especially prominent are
depictions of great Vro'ath priests standing proudly over devoted
worshippers.  Thick candles of red wax provide adequate lighting, but tinged
with sinister crimson glow.  On a tall lectern is a large, opened tome of
Vro'ath writing, most likely a religious text that the elder priests read
from to teach the younger acolytes.

The smell of manure coming from the stalls is overwhelming.  Even the
stable is built of stone.  The stable hand can be seen to the east tending
the other horses.  These horses look well cared for.  It is dark and musty,
reminding the weary vro'ath traveler of the dungeons of Castle Dunluce.
More light can be seen to the east.

south and an even larger structure to the north.  That building houses the
proud legions of Nre'yth.  Some of these soldiers can be seen walking on
this street during the day.  This street runs east and west, coming to an
end just west of here.

south side of the street, inspiring awe from their size rather than their
beauty.  Indeed, these buildings would be considered ugly by any non-Vro'ath
standards.  The mammoth structure to the north is even more ugly in its
plainness, and has a definite military look to it.

sized crowds at this intersection.  To the south along Gruk Street are
various commercial establishments.  Not far away north is the massive
granite wall that seals off the city's northern border.  East and west
Du'alg Path runs, passing by dozens of stone homes.

between more of the same stone buildings that are so common in the city. 
The residents here seem unbothered by the many soldiers walking in their
midst.  Loud rings of metal striking metal come intermittently from the
south.  The importance of the building to the north can be seen in the large
number of guards posted near it.

This hallway, spanning north and south, runs by the sleeping quarters of
some elder, high ranking priests.  At the south end of the hallway, the wall
portrays several scenes from the early history of Nre'yth.  One such scene
depicts the first high priest of the city consecrating the ground for this
temple.  Another section of the wall paintings show Vro'ath priests offering
slaves as sacrifice on an altar to Ne'Shajh.  Few people walk through this
part of this hallway, but those that do often stop and admire the artwork.

apart from the rest of the smaller residential buildings on the south side

`fRich decorations adorn the room of Nre'yth's spiritual and religious
leader.  Although the Vro'ath Church does not directly support the city's
slave trade, the Church does tithe all slave trading.  The furnishings in
this room indicate that such trade has been prosperous.  Thick yeti fur
rugs, bone sculptures, and solid ivory chair are several examples of the
exotic luxuries enjoyed by the current occupant of this room, the High
Priest il'Reshaz.

heavily upon artifacts and complicated symbols.  Thus, the walls in this
room are adorned with repeated geometric patterns, done in all colors of the
rainbow.  Apprentice mages are clustered in several groups, discussing the
teachings of their masters.  To the south and west are classrooms.  A
staircase leads to the upper floors of the school.  The exit into the
streets of the city is north. ``

intersections of the city.  Two nearby buildings seem to hush passers-by
with their overbearing presence.  The one to the northeast is the tallest
structure in the city, slightly more than three stories high, each story
tall enough to fit even the tallest of Vro'aths.  To the southeast is the
most beautiful, or perhaps least ugly, structure in Nre'yth - a temple
dedicated to Ne'shajh.

Rays of sunlight slanting through the windows highlight the dust
particles that accumulate in this shop.  Tall stacks of thick, woolen
fabrics stand neatly against one wall.  Huge racks of clothing stand not too
far away from the unused fabrics.  The coats, shirts, and pants hanging on
the racks are all thick and heavy, made with a cold climate in mind.  Those
clothes also have simple designs, since thick Vro'ath fingers are not nimble
enough to make finer stitches.

Heavy smells of freshly cut meat smothers the air like a blanket.  The
occasional cool breeze wafting in provides little or no relief for delicate
noses.  Cut open carcasses of large animals hang on display at the rear of
the shop.  Almost hidden away in corner of the room are some baskets, full
of dried foodstuffs, mainly vegetables.  The only "fresh" fruits that you
see are sitting on a small stand, over-ripe and soft to the touch.  In
contrast, all types of fresh meat is available.  Most of the customers here
only seem to be interested in buying that.

items stored in here at first glance.  But you can certainly smell some of
them.  The odor somewhat resembles the smell of a swamp, which is not
entirely unexpected considering that many of the ingredients commonly used
in Vro'ath spellcraft come from there.  Once your eyes get adjusted to the
dim light you take another look around, and can see that the shelves which
line the walls hold many earth-ware jars which hold the various ingredients.

Gruk Street~
Gruk Street holds its steady north-south course through Nre'yth.  Here,
it cuts through a quiet neighborhood of some aging buildings.  The houses
are also larger than most you've seen in this city, a clear indication that
their occupants are wealthy.  Faded red paint on the roofs is the only color
offsetting the dull white walls of those homes.  On the other side of the
street, to the east, you see `jHr'usyl's Market.``

Gruk Street~
You travel along Gruk Street, passing by some of the larger and most
likely wealthier homes in Nre'yth.  Even the diligent work of servants or
slaves to keep those buildings clean cannot hide the fact that they are also
many decades old.  The sharp edges and corners on the walls and windows have
been worn smooth after years of wind and rain.  This street extends north
and south.

`fThis broad stairwell stands on the second floor of the building. 
Arcane symbols, engraved carefully and precisely spaced, adorn the walls. 
More classrooms are to the west and south.  The staircase leads up to the

Second Floor Classroom~
`fThis classroom seems to be more of a practical laboratory where students
are allowed to try out spells and methods of casting rather than a normal
room where they read books and discuss the arcane art.  The evidence of this
can be seen in the many scorch marks which adorn the walls and roof, and the
large hole in the southern wall which has been fixed (temporarily) with a
few planks of wood nailed hastily together.

Gruk Street~
Following a north-south course, Gruk Street runs past some of the older
homes in the city.  The plain designs of these buildings are not enhanced by
those small windows.  Looking through the thick glass, you can barely make
out the simple furnishings of those middle class Vro'ath homes to the east. 
The tall building dominating the view to the west has the markings of a
military institution.

Gruk Street~
This street stretches north and south.  It passes by the impressive
Nre'yth Martial Academy to the west.  To the east, you see some older
buildings - all constructed with dull gray stone.  Only the different
colored trim on and near the roofs make these houses not completely
identical.  The presence of many armed soldiers here is an indication of the
domination of the Vro'ath military in this part of the city.

`fUnlike the rooms on the first floor, this room has an ordered arrangement
of seats and a table.  Diagrams of spell procedures cover one wall.  Another
wall has lists of spell components.  There is a large scorch mark on the
nothern wall.  You can only imagine what must have caused such a disaster,
perhaps one of the students got just a little bit ambitious for his own
good.  A door to the south leads to a small room put aside for students to
rest and relax.``

Resting Chamber~
`fThe resting chamber is certainly not a large room, but it provides the
students with a place to escape from the rigours of class.  Here they can
come to relax and contemplate their newfound knowledge.  Cushions line the
east, south and west walls, and you can see a few books left carelessly on
the floor.  Although the room seems well used, it could certainly do with a
cleaning, but no doubt the mages of the school are concerned with things of
more importance than the cleanliness of their rooms.

Bank of Nre'yth~
Uninspired yellow and white paint covers the walls in this room.  A huge
steel vault squats heavily against one wall.  Several tables are scattered
on either side of the vault.  At two of the tables, merchants are
meticulously weighing some coins with balances.  Elsewhere, bankers and
customers discuss financial matters with teeth-aching details and patience. 
Looking around for assistance, you notice a table marked, `o"Deposits and
Withdrawals."  `lAnother table has the appellation, `o"Currency Exchange."

Jeghk's Birds and Beasts~
The smell of dirt and waste permeates the main room of this pet store. 
The stone building looks much like the other buildings in the city.  Chains
protrude from the walls and leftover foods are strewn about the floor making
it difficult for anyone to walk past the front desk.  The cages are filled
with pets that look like human at a distance.  They vary in color, size, and
waste.  Upon closer inspection, the pets have odd characteristics that
humans do not.  The humanoids are naked and caked with a combination of mud
and blood.  They begin whimpering, a sound that only a that only a vro'ath
would be amused by.

Beneath the Streets of Nre'yth~
Your feet make an unpleasant sound as you try to move quietly through the
sewers beneath Nre'yth.  The sounds of scurrying rats can be heard echoing
through the slimy corridors around you.  A sour stench permeates the air and
assaults your senses as you make your way through the sludge that stirs at
your movement.  To the north and south, you can see the tunnels of the sewer
continue on through the darkness.  Above you, tiny streams of light pour
through a rusted sewer grate on the street.

Swirls of mud and dirty water beneath your feet soak through your boots
and send a chill up your spine as you continue to make your way through the
unpleasant sewers.  Large rats swim through the sludge or move along the
outer edges of the wall where it is partly dry.  Your torch light flashes in
their red eyes as one of them turns to study you.  Without a second look, it
continues on its way, oblivious to your pressence.

The foul stench in the air has gotten worse, and you begin to wonder what
else besides the sludge your walking through could be causing such a smell. 
You raise your light higher to peer ahead of you, but the darkness will
yield only slightly to allow you sight.  Your torch light bounces off the
slimy, stone walls around you, and some light shimmers off the dirty waters
that stagnate beneath you causing colors to dance across the weathered
stone.

of the two passages pours into a sewer grate with the loud sounds of rushing
water.  Rats rush past you along the sides of the sewer, staying clear of
the pull of the tiny whirlpool that has formed above the sewer grate.  An
old torch sconce lies embedded in the wall to the north, though it looks
like it hasn't been used in years.

You feel something touch against the side of your leg and you look down
quickly only to see the water swirl and ripple slightly in the darkness. 
You try again to look ahead of you, but the darkness seems to swallow your
light after only a few feet.  Turning to look over your shoulder, the same
darkness seems almost to have swallowed up the way you came, leaving you
alone in encompassing blackness.

The foul stench in the air has gotten worse, and you begin to wonder what
else besides the sludge your walking through could be causing such a smell. 
You raise your light higher to peer ahead of you, but the darkness will
yield only slightly to allow you sight.  Your torch light bounces off the
slimy, stone walls around you, and some light shimmers off the dirty waters
that stagnate beneath you causing colors to dance across the weathered
stone.

Swirls of mud and dirty water beneath your feet soak through your boots
and send a chill up your spine as you continue to make your way through the
unpleasant sewers.  Large rats swim through the sludge or move along the
outer edges of the wall where it is partly dry.  Your torch light flashes in
their red eyes as one of them turns to study you.  Without a second look, it
continues on its way, oblivious to your pressence.

Your feet make an unpleasant sound as you try to move quietly through the
sewers beneath Nre'yth.  The sounds of scurrying rats can be heard echoing
through the slimy corridors around you.  A sour stench permeates the air and
assaults your senses as you make your way through the sludge that stirs at
your movement.  To the north and south, you can see the tunnels of the sewer
continue on through the darkness.  Above you, tiny streams of light pour
through a rusted sewer grate on the street.

Pushing as hard as you can against the deep, slow current of the water
that flows through the sewers of Nre'yth, you try and think of someplace
more pleasant.  The darkness around you confuses your senses and for a
moment, you can't even think of which direction you are heading.  Feeling
the walls around you, you discover that you are in a passage going north and
south.

waters.  The passage continues to the north and south.

The water here pours down into another of the large sewer grates, filling
the corridor with the loud sounds of rushing water.  You thank the stars for
a brief moment of dryness.  You can see cobwebs covering the walls in this
passage, but they don't look quite normal somehow.  Upon examining them c
closer, it almost looks as though they were placed here on purpose.

completely dry.  To the east, the passage seems to make a turn to the south,

cover the wall, almost obscuring it from sight.  As you move from the

in the wall.  As you move closer, you can see the outline of a door in the

One of the only surviving criminal elements in the city of Nry'eth, the
Red Shadows make their home in one of the only places the Vro'ath do not

Shadows live a comfortable existence stealing from the merchants and traders
of Nry'eth and then quickly retreating below ground.  You stand in the large

A Game Room~
The light in this room almost blinds you from having been in the sewers
for so long.  Your eyes quickly adjust and you take in your surroundings. 
The room is rather small and is mostly barren.  The only thing of note is a
small wooden table in the center of the room with chairs around it.  The
tabletop appears to be covered with a scattered deck of cards.

You squeeze your way into the small closet and look around.  Brooms and
other simple supplies are piled and hung in various places about the closet,
and there is a small mat on the floor.  It looks as though someone has
recently slept on it.

A Meeting Room~
You step from the hallway and into a large room filled with rows of
chairs.  The chairs are all lined up in even rows, and you can see a large
table at the far northern end of the room.  This looks to be some type of
meeting room for the thieves of the Red Shadow guild.  A well-lit hallway
opens up to the west, and a darkened hallway leaves this room to the south. 
A wooden door lies in the east wall.

A Map Room~
This room is small, and you are forced to use a light to see.  The
torches in this room are unlit, and as you peer about you notice large
papers nailed to the walls of the room.  Upon closer inspection, you
discover that the papers on the walls are actually maps of the city of
Nry'eth.  Many markings have been made on the maps, but you can not read
them.  A small door leads back into the meeting room to the west.

You find yourself standing in something of an intersection in the
hallway.  The hallway continues its way to the north and south while wooden
doors lie to the east and west.  You put your ear to the door but hear
nothing.  Looking down the hallway to the south, you see a bit of light

you guess that this is someone's bed chamber, and probably someone pretty
important.  A large bed is set against the southwest wall and a large

You are very astonished to find a place of such beauty in these wretched
sewers.  The room is lavishly decorated in bolts of the finest silk.  They
hang from all the walls in the room, draping the entire room in dark red. 
The light in the room seems to be coming from nowhere and with the cloth
hanging from the walls, it seems to cast red shadows all about the room.  A
huge canopy bed lies against the east wall with red satin sheets and red
satin hanging down from the canopy and concealing the entire east side of
the room.  A wooden door leads back to the west, into the meeting room
beyond.

around a large, flat wooden platform, upon which stands an auctioneer and
several slaves.  The potential buyers among the crowd carefully scrutinize
their future property.  Satisfied that the slaves are in excellent physical
health, the buyers shout their bids quickly.  The rest of the slave market
is spread out around you.

You are at the busy slave market of Nre'yth.  Most of the merchants here
are too absorbed in their trading to notice anything except their slaves and
potential customers.  Occasionally, an armed Vro'ath guard enters the market
and herds several slaves to the corners of this stone paved square, which
are to the east and west.  The center of the market is south.  `k`lHadukk
Road`l stretches northward, away from the market.  ``

You are in a market dedicated to slave trading.  Sellers entice and
persuade buyers by showing off the fine physical attributes of their slaves.
However, the acute eyes of the buyers also catch minor, often trifling
imperfections.  A registration `ooffice`l for slave owners is to the west. 
`k`lHadukk Road`l, one of the main streets of Nre'yth, runs north and south
through the market.``

You are at the noisy and crowded slave trading market of Nre'yth. 
Slaves, bound at the hands and neck with iron chains, watch listlessly as
others barter over their futures.  The ground is bare, hard stone, and no
furniture of any sort is available to relieve tired feet.  An auction is
being held at the center of the market to the west.  You see more slaves
gathered together to the north and south.  `k`lBujaghn Way,`l one of the main
streets of the city, extends east.  ``

At this corner of the square, you see some wretched figures, most likely
slaves, huddled together.  A few armed Vro'ath soldiers stand guard over
them.  Periodically, one of the guards leads several slaves to the center of
the square, where an auction for slaves is held.  The hard, paved stone
ground is certainly not comfortable for the barefoot slaves.  There is more
activity to the east and south.

Slave Registration Office~
The cool white walls of this room provide some relief from the warmth the
sun outside.  A large wooden desk, the favorite furniture of beaucrats,
squats near the southern wall of the room.  Behind this desk sits a past
middle age Vro'ath official, her eyes glued to the sea of papers and
parchments on her desk.  In front of the desk, some people wait in a crudely
formed line for their turn to register their slaves with the Vro'ath
military.  All slaves living under Vro'ath jurisdiction are allowed to go
free after five years of service; registration is a beaucratic tool used to
keep track of a slave's years of service.  Exits to the north and east lead
to the slave market.

these slaves is the careful examination that they are receiving from some
shrewd buyers.  West and north leads to the busier sections of the market.

respect and reverence.  Even some of the civilans gaze at the statue with
pride gleaming in their eyes.  Not surprisingly, there is no visible
evidence of vandalism.  `k`lHadukk Road`l continues north and south, while

haggling vigorously.  But this is no ordinary trading.  The presence of
half-clothed, chained figures - most of them humans - indicates that slaves
are being bought and sold as property in the market nearby to the north. 
This road also leads south, toward a city gate far in the distance.

Inside the Southern Gate~
You are inside the southern wall of Nre'yth.  The street running parallel
to the wall extends east and west.  The perpendicular street, `k`lHadukk
Road`l, is the main north-south thoroughfare of the city.  This intersection
is almost never empty during the day, since all those who enter or exit the
city through the southern gate must pass by here.  That gate is open before
sunrise and closed after sunset each day.  ``

Outside the Southern Gate~
You stand before a mighty gate leading into the Vro'ath stronghold of
Nre'yth.  This is the only opening in the towering wall that protects the
city's southern boundary.  The gatekeepers are heavily armed soldiers who
seem oblivious to all those who pass through the gate while it is open. 
However, when the gate is closed, they stand alert and allow no one to pass.

Southern Guardhouse~
The drab and simple furnishings in these quarters are not surprising.  A
few beds, several chairs, and a table laden with leftover food are all that
the guards who live here have.  One of them is busy cleaning the rust off
some suits of armor while another sharpens and polishes the blades of a half
dozen swords.  Yet another guard is sprawled across a chair, napping and
snoring with the usual lack of regard for anyone's eardrums.

A Rocky Trail~
Cold winds howl as you follow this steep mountain trail.  The roughness

You travel along the main north-south thoroughfare of Nre'yth.  The road
is well paved and wide enough to accomodate the constant traffic that it
sees.  Most of the people you see are headed south, towards the slave
market.  The road also runs north, to other commercial areas.

entering and in a sour mood upon exiting.

granite wall looms over you nearby to the north.  The two buildings which
occupy opposite sides on this part of the street are little more than huge
blocks of stone.  With those thick walls, these two structures were clearly
meant as places of protection.  Naturally, both are under the control of the
Vro'ath military.

Still, this street - like all streets in Nre'yth - is well maintained and
cleaned regularly, so it shows few cracks or other disfigurations.  Two
large structures stand over both sides of the road.  Both seem to be of
great interest to the soldiers who patrol this part of the city.

vicinity bode well for the city's trade.  Du'alg Path continues its course
to the east and west, while Hadukk Road runs steadily north and south.

of people through this street is common during the day.  Yet, the road is
remarkably clean at all times.  Perhaps a team of diligent janitors clean
the city's streets every night.  They certainly do not show themselves
during the day.  The street runs into a busy market area to the west and
meets an intersection to the east.

but still fairly wide.  Hardly any space remains between those houses
clustered together.  Their slanted roofs are even touching at the edges.

building are often carrying books, scrolls, and pens.  Their simple robes
even make them look scholarly at times.  The road heads north and south.

west, you see some decent, but not so fancy homes.  The temple close by to
the northeast displays grandeur that seems out of character for these
brutish Vro'aths.  Even the azure-robed priests and crimson-cloaked shamans
that you encounter almost seem dignified as they march solemnly from the
temple.  The entrance to that temple is along Hrathn Street, which runs
north and south from here.  `k`lBujahn Way`l maintains a steady east-west
course.  ``

pedestrians that come to this part of the city.  However, these soldiers do
not appear to be part of the Vro'ath military.  Their uniforms and
deferential manner towards the priests suggest that these soldiers are
guards for the nearby temple.  Not far to the east, Aven Teluk hovers
majestically over the city.

huge and daunting mountain, Aven `lTeluk, bars the way east.  The nearby
temple to the northwest lack the usual ponderous structure and the simple
design of the city's other buildings.  A careful attention to details and a
steadfast devotion to symmetry are immediately noticeable about that temple
to those who can appreciate the merits of good architecture.  Surely, some
foreign architects were responsible for the design of that structure. 
`k`lTeluk Street`l stretches north and south along the eastern edge of the
city, while Bujaghn Way runs west from here.  Beneath your feet you can hear
water pouring into a sewer grate.

there are some armed Vro'ath guards standing near the holy clerics of

building.  The number of people constantly entering and leaving that temple

city's residents.  A shop called `o"Nre'yth Travelers' Supplies"`l is

Homes along this street are by no means extravagant or opulent in
appearance, but they do reflect the considerable wealth of this

larger house.  However, those houses are just as plain as the smaller ones
throughout the city.  They were built larger, but not any prettier.

Talir Street~
This street runs along the western edge of the city.  Very little air
stirs during the day.  Fortunately, this area has a cool climate, so the
sun's heat does not bake those who live in this city.  Nights here are
chilly, but the thick-skinned Vro'aths do not seem to mind.  The street
continues north and south.

Talir Street at Northwall Path~
You stand near the northwest corner of Nre'yth, where the protective
northern wall merges into the hard rock of Aven Talir.  Being so close to
the mountain, you can almost feel those steep slopes to the west looming
over you.  Together with the towering granite wall, the mountain provides
the city with almost impregnable defenses.  Even for the warlike Vro'aths,
that wall was no mean feat of military engineering.

Walking along this street, you feel safe and reassured by the nearby
presence of a stalwart granite wall.  To the south, you see a building that
epitomizes the Vro'aths' lack of creativity.  The plain stone walls, the
neat and straight edges, and the few perfect squares for windows would
offend the sensibilities of any self-respecting architect.  To make matters
worse, this monstrosity occupies a fair amount of this street, which
continues east and west.

This street runs next to the towering northern wall of Nre'yth.  A plain
stone building dominates the view to the south.  The clinking sounds of
metallic armor warn you of the approach of armed Vro'ath soldiers, who often
patrol along this street.  They do not seem hostile, but standing in their
way as they march by is definitely not a wise decision.

Northwall Path at Gruk Street~
You travel through the northern edge of the city on a clean, paved road. 
The crisp mountain air is a bit chilly on clear mornings but still
thoroughly refreshing.  As the sun dips toward the horizon during the late
afternoon, the weather in this city is actually quite pleasant.  Of course,
this is assuming that the sky is clear of those thick fleecy clouds which
are so common in this region of the world.

Strolling along this street, you feel comforted by the protective
presence of the nearby granite wall.  Yet, the view around you seems so
harsh and unforgiving, with nothing but hard rock and stone in sight. 
Looking at the brutish faces of the Vro'aths that you encounter only
reinforces this somber image.  This plain, even austere, street spans east
and west.

neighborhood.  Most of the residents here do not seem to mind the presence
of strangers too much.  However, their disinterested stares become sneers
when they notice humans passing by.  You even see humans being bodily thrown
out of establishment to the east, `o"Wistarg's Armoury".  ``

active district in the city, filled with sounds of conversation that seem to
be coming to you from all directions.  Most of the noise is coming from the
large houses standing on the west side of the street.  Their faded exteriors
do nothing to improve the looks of some already plain stone buildings.

not even bother to look at where they are going, it seems.  They just bump
and shuffle their way past you.  Armed guards stand in front of building to
the east, one of the new ones you have seen in this neighborhood.  Looking
more closely, you see that is is the Bank of Nre'yth.

the huge wall next to you.  A two-story inn stands on the south side of the
street.  The continuous buzz of activity and conversation coming from there
is a sure sign of moderate prosperity for that establishment.  Of course,
the inn's proximity to one of the city's busier intersections, which is to
the east, is no coincidence.

Some unremarkable stone houses sit on the south side of the street.  True to
their simple-minded natures, most Vro'aths live in homes that are plain to
the point of boredom.  The intersection to the west seems fairly busy and
crowded.  Activity on this street gradually subsides to the east.

part of Nre'yth.  Most of this activity is the passage of people to and from
a large temple just northeast of here.  Directly east are some homes,
constructed of dull yet sturdy gray stone, the favorite material of
Vro'aths.  On the opposite side of the street, to the west, you a sign which
reads `o"Jeghk's Birds and Beasts" `lin front of a small, noisy building.

Vro'ath homes.  Nothing special about them grabs your attention.  Smooth
stone walls, rectangular windows, and slightly slanted roofs colored in dark
red are features that you notice after a quick look.  The street extends
north and south, running by more houses in this residential district.

buildings.  Traffic along this part of Hrathn Street is moderate.  Few among
the Vro'ath citizens spare you more than a cursory, uninterested glance. 
The travelers who look around in wonder or confusion are almost always
non-natives of this city.  An intersection to the south provides a reference
point for those who are lost.

southern side of the street.  If you did not know better, you could believe
that these fierce and warlike beings lead simple lives.  Northwall Path
intersects another street to the east and also leads west toward the

the School of the Bren Uthare.  The Vro'aths that enter and leave the
building do not look like warriors.  Instead, they actually look scholarly
with all the books, scrolls, and writing instruments that they carry.  What
could they be studying?

It does not require a genius to understand why the simple-minded Vro'aths
name this street Northwall Path.  A few robed Vro'aths, none of them looking
particularly simple-minded, stand near the towering builing to the south, so
deep in their discussion that they do not seem to notice you.  Looking at
the building, you see the words "School of the Bren Uthare" inscribed a
third of the way up its stony exterior.  The street runs east and west.

slight breeze tickles your cheeks as you walk along this lonely part of the
street.  The few clouds gathered in the azure sky seem harmless, yet
residents of this city know about and have experienced the wrath of
inclement weather during the rainy season.  East and west Northwall Path
continues, while Hrathn Street runs south.

You stand near the northeast corner of Nre'yth, where the protective
northern wall merges into the hard rock of Aven Teluk.  Craning your neck
back slightly, you can see the snow-covered peak of this mountain.  The
pristine beauty of the pure white snow can make anyone forget that an
avalanche, created from such snow, would be disastrous for this part of the
city during wintertime.  From this corner intersection, Teluk Street runs
south and Northwall Path leads west.

base of one of the city's two rocky neighbors, Aven Teluk.  You notice a
distinct lack of plants in this city.  The climate here is somewhat cold,
but that is not the main reason for the near absence of vegetation.  In this
rocky terrain, only a few ugly weeds and scraggly bushes can survive.  Teluk
Street extends north and south.

stories tall, can cover the street with its shadow.  The Vro'aths that you
see around here puzzle you.  Their faces are brutish as ever, but there is
confidence in their demeanor and a spark of intelligence in their eyes.

traces the eastern edge of the city.  It passes near the base of the huge
mountain that blocks the way into Nre'yth from the east.  Steep and
forbidding, the slopes of Aven Teluk look almost impossible to climb.  To
the west you can see an enclosure for some huge woolly quadrupeds called
mi'enkhrn.  Those animals provide a food and fabric source for the city's
residents.

the street, is a building whose magnificence mark it as a place of high
esteem in this city.  Indeed, this is where Vro'aths go to worship their
god.  A few of them are entering the temple through a doorway just south of
here.  Teluk Street also leads north.

priests standing at the doorway utter their blessings to each of them.

Street.  During the mornings, Aven Teluk to the east darkens this road with
its montrous shadow, making the chilly mountain air even colder.  The
Vro'aths have easily adapted to such a climate after centuries of living
here.  With their thick skins, they might even feel warm wearing heavy
clothing.  The wool for such clothing appears to be supplied by sheep-like
animals kept in a pen to the west.

them from the frigid air.  Those beasts create considerable noise on this

the city are neat and easy on the feet of all travelers, and this street is
no exception.  However, in a city built for three and even four meter tall
residents, streets are bound to seem lengthy for shorter people.  Already
you see that this street stretches a goodly way north, but not as far south.

looking out the window set into the northern wall you can watch the

stench which fills the air.  Looking around you see many things of magical
nature, but you feel confident the reek is eminating from a vial of some
liquid which is bubbling away and giving off brown fumes on a bench along
the northern wall.  Glancing around you realise how much you do not know of
the magical ways.  Gren'yar's walls are covered in runes and insignias which
you have never seen before, and his shelves littered with the components for
spells many years beyond your reach.  You realise in sudden awe that you are
standing in the presence of possibly the most powerful Vro'ath mage alive.  ``

Teluk Street~
Tracing along the city's eastern edge, this street passes under the
shadow of Aven Teluk.  The mountain stands like a silent guardian over this
part of the city.  Wooden houses in this neighborhood indicate that their
residents are among the poorer citizens.  Still, Nre'yth cannot be said to
have slums.  The buildings cannot compare to the stone ones elsewhere in the
city, but they are by no means shabby shacks.  Teluk Street leads to some
finer stone buildings to the north and meets a wall to the south.

You stand near the southeast corner of Nre'yth, where the protective
southern wall merges into the hard rock of Aven Teluk.  This corner of the
city is in a rather poor neighborhood.  Not that the streets or houses are
dirty or run-down.  But these wooden buildings seem to be hastily
constructed, as if the residents were not able to afford sturdier building
materials and did not have enough time to do a complete and proper job of
construction.  From this corner, Teluk Street extends north and Southwall
Path stretches west.

those who travel along `lSouthwall Path.  This district of the city is poor,
but not run-down.  Despite their grotesque and even monstrous appearances,
the Vro'aths have an unexplainable propensity to keep things orderly and
neat.  A cross street intersects `k`lSouthwall Path`l to the west.  ``

Southwall Path at Hrathn Street~
At this T-shaped intersection, `lHrathn Street runs into `lSouthwall Path. 
Quietude settles over this part of the city like a cozy blanket.  The few
people you meet here are mainly non-Vro'ath foreigners, trying to find their
way around.  `k`lHrathn Street`l begins its northward journey through Nre'yth
here, while `k`lSouthwall Path`l runs east and west.  ``

Southwall Path~
The stalwart granite wall parallels your progress as you travel along
Southwall Path.  You wonder how many years of effort the construction of
such a massive wall required.  Perhaps one of the few Vro'aths walking along
this lonely street might know.  However, those gruesome faces do not seem to
be in a talkative mood.

Weapons and Armor Storage~
In the dim light, you can pieces of armor piled high up against the
walls.  This end of the warehouse also holds racks of the huge weapons that
Vro'aths favor - two-handed broadswords, heavy lances, and long spiked
whips.  Naturally, the weapons are held securely in place and locked so that
only authorized hands may take them.  Looking through the gloom, you can see
the rest of the warehouse to the north.

Equipment and Supplies Storage~
In this dimly lit room, you see more stacks of crates.  Dark green
markings identify the contents of the crates to those who understand such
writing.  Looking into a few of the opened boxes, you see blankets,
bedrolls, clothing, and some cooking utensils.  This huge warehouse extends
north and south.

Food Storage~
Supplies and equipment have been carefully hoarded inside this warehouse.
Boxes and creates stacked in this room have yellow markings upon them.  The
smell of dried food coming from those stacks leads you to believe that this
is where the Vro'ath legions store their spare rations.  Strangely, this
room is not visibly guarded from within, but the lack of dust on the
supplies indicate that they are not being overlooked either.

Southwall Path~
You journey along Southwall Path under the protective presence of a
massive wall.  Some of the huge Vro'aths tramp through the street with no
regard to the smaller foreigners in their path.  Certainly, those smells
coming from the north side of the street do not entice anyone to linger
around here.  What you see to the north is most likely the exterior of some
barn or stable.  Even thick wooden walls cannot mask the unmistakable stench
of animal ordure.  Traveling east or west along this street may provide some
relief.

Southwall Path~
You walk next to a high, protective wall as you travel through the
southern edge of Nre'yth.  Being so close to the city's southern gate, you
see many people here, not a few of them looking lost.  Neat and plain houses
to the north indicate that you are in a residential neighborhood.  Southwall
Path extends to the west and to the east, where there is a fairly crowded
and busy intersection.

Hrathn Street~
This street passes by the poorer homes in Nre'yth.  Still, those houses
to the east are not so run-down that they deserve to be termed "slums".  The
wood used their construction can be considered decent and sturdy.  Yet,
Vro'aths feel that wood is much inferior to stone.  Hence, a wooden house is
much cheaper than a stone one in a Vro'ath city.

Hrathn Street~
The street maintains a north-south path.  In this neighborhood, you
notice some of the less wealthy residents in the city.  Nothing in their
appearance suggests that they are poor.  They are decently dressed and are
about as clean as any other Vro'aths you meet.  But their slightly hunched
over gait and those callused hands are clear indications that these Vro'aths
do not enjoy simple or easy lives.  Their wooden homes are crowded together
on the east side of the street.

Hrathn Street~
Hrathn Street leads north away from the southern wall of Nre'yth, heading
toward the city's northern wall at the other end.  The suffocating smell of
animal excrement drifts in from the west to torment your nose.  Looking in
that direction, you see the plain wooden exterior of a building which you
guess to be some stables.  Close by to the south, you can see an
intersection, which is within the shade of the protective southern wall of
the city.

Southwall Path~
The towering southern wall of Nre'yth faithfully follows you along this
street.  Whistling winds sound unnaturally loud as they gust along the road
and sting your unprotected face.  The line of houses to the north and the
wall to the south forms a natural channel for the chilly winds coming from
the mountain not far to the west.  You wonder if those stone homes provide
any warmth and protection against this cold weather.

Southwall Path at Gruk Street~
At this quiet intersection, `lGruk Street meets `lSouthwall Path.  Soldiers
patrolling here are definitely not in a friendly mood.  Though they speak no
words, their glances strongly suggest that you should get on with your
business and not loiter around here.  `k`lGruk Street`l heads north, and
`k`lSouthwall Path`l runs east and west.  ``

quiet in this part of the city is interrupted only by the sounds of many
marching feet coming from the building to the north.  At night, silence
reigns supreme in this neighborhood.  `k`lSouthwall Path`l spans east and west
and meets a cross street just east of here.  ``

the protective southern wall of the city.  You hear the steady tread of many
feet marching in unison coming from building to the north.  That building is
a military school for the Vro'aths, so these sounds must the cadets
practicing how to march properly.  Occasionally, some of them even march
along this street.

Talir Street at Southwall Path~
You stand near the southwest corner of Nre'yth, where the protective
southern wall merges into the hard rock of Aven `lTalir.  That great mountain
watches silently over the western side of the city.  The large building to
the northeast is the Nre'yth Martial Academy, where new recruits for the
Vro'ath legions are trained.  `k`lSouthwall Path`l runs east, parallel to a
high granite wall.  `k`lTalir Street`l heads north.  ``

see the back of the institution where Vro'ath soldiers are trained.  The few
windows on the white stone building do not provide a good view of what is
happening inside.  Almost no one travels through this part of Talir Street,
which continues to the north and south.

which this street was named, to the west.  This silence in this part of the
city is surprising.  The only sounds you hear are occasional chants, full of
martial rhythm and vigor, coming from many voices in the building to the
east.  Straight as only Vro'aths could find pleasant, the street runs north
and south.

the east, you see an open field upon which some cadets are training.  Talir
Street continues north and south.  A sturdy fence restricts access into the
training field to the east from outside the military school.

You enter a dining area for the soldiers.  A kitchen this is, but one run
with ruthless efficiency rather than any regard for turning out delectable
dishes.  From the lack of skill shown by the several assistant cooks, you
guess that the soldiers take turns performing those duties.  Under the
competent direction of the burly head cook, everyone that comes through here
is fed adequately and upon demand.

Sleeping Quarters~
The beds in this room are arranged in short, neat rows.  Each bed looks
barely large enough to fit one person, especially considering the size of a
Vro'ath.  Even with the tight, regular schedules that the soldiers have to
keep, there are always beds occupied, day or night.  Thus, quiet in this
room is rare, as sleeping soldiers do not care for the ears of others.

Talir Street at Lowegk Path~
The meeting of Talir Street and Lowegk Path forms this intersection. 
Being at the western edge of Nre'yth, this juncture enjoys a calm and lonely
existence.  The harsh, shouted commands of Vro'ath drillmasters in the
training field to the southeast carry even to here, but they only sound like
loud whispers at this distance.  Lowegk Path begins its slow eastward trek
across the city here, while Talir Street is forever condemned to run north
and south.  The way west is blocked by the sheer, rocky sides of Aven Talir.

Your journey through the western end of the city continues along Talir

However, Vro'aths do not show off their wealth by adding adornments to their
houses; they simply make them bigger.  Still, these buildings are dwarfed by
the mountain on the other side of the street, to the west.

climbers.  The strategic position of this city is obvious even to those
untrained in war.  A natural barrier like that mountain to the west means
one less border for the soldiers to worry about and defend.

soldiers, some of them still in training by the looks of their uniforms,
frequently visit this part of the street.  They receive their physical
instruction and exercise their drills in an open field to the south.  The
field is part of the Nre'yth Martial Academy, an establishment that serves
the dual purposes of training soldiers and administering the secular affairs
of the city.  Lowegk Path runs into Talir Street to the west.

nature of the Vro'aths is clearly visible as you look around.  It is not
just the obvious presence of armed troops, but the orderly way they march
and the cold look of determination in their eyes that convince you they are
a race bred for military conquest.  Lowegk Path meets a perpendicular street
to the east and leads the base of a mountain not far west.

the peace with their weapons, and their glares demand silence from all those

you can see some dull but durable stone domiciles.
