Ensconced in a Hallowed Haven~
Wind currents toss you around madly, back and forth across a small distance. 
Although your support feels very unstable, you never drop down more than     
an inch before being carried back up by a strong current and tossed back     
into the fray.  Thick purple and black smoke oozes from cracks in nothing,   
coating the air with a thick, dark mist that prevents you from seeing        
anything except your immediate surroundings as the winds toss you about      
again.

Pristine white clouds surge and roll out in thunderous billows above you,    
contrasting with dark black thunderheads underneath.  The roiling masses     
of air touch each other briefly as you watch, and then coil away from one    
another quickly in a strange harmonious balance.  Glasslike air forms an     
airtight shield around you, suspending you in the midst of these mysterious  
giants, and letting you watch as nature conducts its amazing symphony.

Spinning bright suns rotate around you at maddening paces, shedding blinding 
rays of pure sunlight to your face.  Amazingly, the light does not impair    
your vision, and the whole maddening scene unfolds before you, the suns      
and planets close enough to touch, and spiralling at incredible speeds,      
changing shape constantly as they move in a frenzy around you.  The gravity   
wells created by this completely strange phenomenon keep you suspended       
in one place, to watch until your time has ended.

Small stone pillars rise in an ascending spiral, meeting in the center       
at a gigantic conical monolith of marble, from which the clear bubble that   
suspends you rests upon.  Fields of dark gray nothingness fill your vision   
in every direction, giving you a strange sense of loneliness and spatial     
distortion.  The occasional flashes and streaks of bright yellow lightning   
that arc across the sky are your only companions out here in this strange

The astral dimensions of all time and space are unveiled to you as you look  
cautiously around the clear encasement that suspends you above the endless   
sprawl of space and time.  Swirls of primordial gas form into the basis      
for newborn planets and stars, just outside of your reach.  As you scan      
around in awe, a fragment of a shattered comet speeds by, close enough to    
touch and bright enough to blind.

for newborn planets and stars, just outside of your reach.  As you scan      
around in awe, a fragment of a shattered comet speeds by, close enough to    
touch and bright enough to blind.

Wind currents toss you around madly, back and forth across a small distance. 
Although your support feels very unstable, you never drop down more than     
an inch before being carried back up by a strong current and tossed back     
into the fray.  Thick purple and black smoke oozes from cracks in nothing,   
coating the air with a thick, dark mist that prevents you from seeing        
anything except your immediate surroundings as the winds toss you about      
again.

Pristine white clouds surge and roll out in thunderous billows above you,    
contrasting with dark black thunderheads underneath.  The roiling masses     
of air touch each other briefly as you watch, and then coil away from one    
another quickly in a strange harmonious balance.  Glasslike air forms an     
airtight shield around you, suspending you in the midst of these mysterious  
giants, and letting you watch as nature conducts its amazing symphony.

Small stone pillars rise in an ascending spiral, meeting in the center       
at a gigantic conical monolith of marble, from which the clear bubble that   
suspends you rests upon.  Fields of dark gray nothingness fill your vision   
in every direction, giving you a strange sense of loneliness and spatial     
distortion.  The occasional flashes and streaks of bright yellow lightning   
that arc across the sky are your only companions out here in this strange

Spinning bright suns rotate around you at maddening paces, shedding blinding 
rays of pure sunlight to your face.  Amazingly, the light does not impair    
your vision, and the whole maddening scene unfolds before you, the suns      
and planets close enough to touch, and spiralling at incredible speeds,      
changing shape constantly as they move in a frenzy around you.  The gravity   
wells created by this completely strange phenomenon keep you suspended       
in one place, to watch until your time has ended.

Pristine white clouds surge and roll out in thunderous billows above you,    
contrasting with dark black thunderheads underneath.  The roiling masses     
of air touch each other briefly as you watch, and then coil away from one    
another quickly in a strange harmonious balance.  Glasslike air forms an     
airtight shield around you, suspending you in the midst of these mysterious  
giants, and letting you watch as nature conducts its amazing symphony.

Wind currents toss you around madly, back and forth across a small distance. 
Although your support feels very unstable, you never drop down more than     
an inch before being carried back up by a strong current and tossed back     
into the fray.  Thick purple and black smoke oozes from cracks in nothing,   
coating the air with a thick, dark mist that prevents you from seeing        
anything except your immediate surroundings as the winds toss you about      
again.

The astral dimensions of all time and space are unveiled to you as you look  
cautiously around the clear encasement that suspends you above the endless   
sprawl of space and time.  Swirls of primordial gas form into the basis      
for newborn planets and stars, just outside of your reach.  As you scan      
around in awe, a fragment of a shattered comet speeds by, close enough to    
touch and bright enough to blind.

Spinning bright suns rotate around you at maddening paces, shedding blinding 
rays of pure sunlight to your face.  Amazingly, the light does not impair    
your vision, and the whole maddening scene unfolds before you, the suns      
and planets close enough to touch, and spiralling at incredible speeds,      
changing shape constantly as they move in a frenzy around you.  The gravity   
wells created by this completely strange phenomenon keep you suspended

Ensconced in a Hallowed Haven~
The astral dimensions of all time and space are unveiled to you as you look  
cautiously around the clear encasement that suspends you above the endless   
sprawl of space and time.  Swirls of primordial gas form into the basis      
for newborn planets and stars, just outside of your reach.  As you scan      
around in awe, a fragment of a shattered comet speeds by, close enough to    
touch and bright enough to blind.

Wind currents toss you around madly, back and forth across a small distance. 
Although your support feels very unstable, you never drop down more than     
an inch before being carried back up by a strong current and tossed back     
into the fray.  Thick purple and black smoke oozes from cracks in nothing,   
coating the air with a thick, dark mist that prevents you from seeing        
anything except your immediate surroundings as the winds toss you about      
again.

Murky green fluid rushes in to enclose you, flowing just inches from your    
body.  A strange shimmering shield quickly forms around you, protecting      
you from the life-sapping fluid and suspending you in the green ichor.       
As you move your head madly in an attempt to look for escape, a swirling

contrasting with dark black thunderheads underneath.  The roiling masses     
of air touch each other briefly as you watch, and then coil away from one

Ensconced in a Hallowed Haven~
The astral dimensions of all time and space are unveiled to you as you look  
cautiously around the clear encasement that suspends you above the endless   
sprawl of space and time.  Swirls of primordial gas form into the basis      
for newborn planets and stars, just outside of your reach.  As you scan      
around in awe, a fragment of a shattered comet speeds by, close enough to    
touch and bright enough to blind.

Pristine white clouds surge and roll out in thunderous billows above you,    
contrasting with dark black thunderheads underneath.  The roiling masses     
of air touch each other briefly as you watch, and then coil away from one    
another quickly in a strange harmonious balance.  Glasslike air forms an     
airtight shield around you, suspending you in the midst of these mysterious  
giants, and letting you watch as nature conducts its amazing symphony.

Spinning bright suns rotate around you at maddening paces, shedding blinding 
rays of pure sunlight to your face.  Amazingly, the light does not impair    
your vision, and the whole maddening scene unfolds before you, the suns      
and planets close enough to touch, and spiralling at incredible speeds,      
changing shape constantly as they move in a frenzy around you.  The gravity   
wells created by this completely strange phenomenon keep you suspended       
in one place, to watch until your time has ended.

Wind currents toss you around madly, back and forth across a small distance. 
Although your support feels very unstable, you never drop down more than     
an inch before being carried back up by a strong current and tossed back     
into the fray.  Thick purple and black smoke oozes from cracks in nothing,   
coating the air with a thick, dark mist that prevents you from seeing        
anything except your immediate surroundings as the winds toss you about      
again.

cautiously around the clear encasement that suspends you above the endless   
sprawl of space and time.  Swirls of primordial gas form into the basis      
for newborn planets and stars, just outside of your reach.  As you scan      
around in awe, a fragment of a shattered comet speeds by, close enough to    
touch and bright enough to blind.

Ensconced in a Hallowed Haven~
Spinning bright suns rotate around you at maddening paces, shedding blinding 
rays of pure sunlight to your face.  Amazingly, the light does not impair    
your vision, and the whole maddening scene unfolds before you, the suns      
and planets close enough to touch, and spiralling at incredible speeds,      
changing shape constantly as they move in a frenzy around you.  The gravity   
wells created by this completely strange phenomenon keep you suspended       
in one place, to watch until your time has ended.

Ensconced in a Hallowed Haven~
Wind currents toss you around madly, back and forth across a small distance. 
Although your support feels very unstable, you never drop down more than     
an inch before being carried back up by a strong current and tossed back     
into the fray.  Thick purple and black smoke oozes from cracks in nothing,   
coating the air with a thick, dark mist that prevents you from seeing        
anything except your immediate surroundings as the winds toss you about      
again.

Ensconced in a Hallowed Haven~
Murky green fluid rushes in to enclose you, flowing just inches from your    
body.  A strange shimmering shield quickly forms around you, protecting      
you from the life-sapping fluid and suspending you in the green ichor.       
As you move your head madly in an attempt to look for escape, a swirling     
vortex opens up above you, floating silently above your shield, the answer   
to your prayers.

Pristine white clouds surge and roll out in thunderous billows above you,    
contrasting with dark black thunderheads underneath.  The roiling masses     
of air touch each other briefly as you watch, and then coil away from one    
another quickly in a strange harmonious balance.  Glasslike air forms an     
airtight shield around you, suspending you in the midst of these mysterious  
giants, and letting you watch as nature conducts its amazing symphony.

Small stone pillars rise in an ascending spiral, meeting in the center       
at a gigantic conical monolith of marble, from which the clear bubble that

in every direction, giving you a strange sense of loneliness and spatial

around in awe, a fragment of a shattered comet speeds by, close enough to    
touch and bright enough to blind.

Ensconced in a Hallowed Haven~
Wind currents toss you around madly, back and forth across a small distance. 
Although your support feels very unstable, you never drop down more than     
an inch before being carried back up by a strong current and tossed back     
into the fray.  Thick purple and black smoke oozes from cracks in nothing,   
coating the air with a thick, dark mist that prevents you from seeing        
anything except your immediate surroundings as the winds toss you about      
again.

Ensconced in a Hallowed Haven~
Pristine white clouds surge and roll out in thunderous billows above you,    
contrasting with dark black thunderheads underneath.  The roiling masses     
of air touch each other briefly as you watch, and then coil away from one    
another quickly in a strange harmonious balance.  Glasslike air forms an     
airtight shield around you, suspending you in the midst of these mysterious  
giants, and letting you watch as nature conducts its amazing symphony.

Spinning bright suns rotate around you at maddening paces, shedding blinding 
rays of pure sunlight to your face.  Amazingly, the light does not impair    
your vision, and the whole maddening scene unfolds before you, the suns      
and planets close enough to touch, and spiralling at incredible speeds,      
changing shape constantly as they move in a frenzy around you.  The gravity   
wells created by this completely strange phenomenon keep you suspended       
in one place, to watch until your time has ended.

Ensconced in a Hallowed Haven~
Murky green fluid rushes in to enclose you, flowing just inches from your    
body.  A strange shimmering shield quickly forms around you, protecting      
you from the life-sapping fluid and suspending you in the green ichor.       
As you move your head madly in an attempt to look for escape, a swirling     
vortex opens up above you, floating silently above your shield, the answer   
to your prayers.

The astral dimensions of all time and space are unveiled to you as you look  
cautiously around the clear encasement that suspends you above the endless   
sprawl of space and time.  Swirls of primordial gas form into the basis      
for newborn planets and stars, just outside of your reach.  As you scan      
around in awe, a fragment of a shattered comet speeds by, close enough to    
touch and bright enough to blind.
