ExDe fountain~ A bronze statue of King Devon Dunluce, the powerful man who founded the
Athanmere line, stands boldly atop the back of an enormous beast.  While
Devon's bronze eyes stare sightlessly southwards, towards the castle that
bears his name, the bronze beast rears slightly under his feet.  Water pours
from the mouth and blowhole of the beast, which appears something like a
cross between a giant crocodile and a whale.  The elaborate stone work that
holds the pool of water has been carefully sculpted with stories from the
life of Devon Dunluce.
