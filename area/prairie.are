`dThis must be the ugliest beast you have ever seen.  The color of the fur that is
left is some kind of mix between of dung-brown and snot-grey.  The teeth are
crooked and yellow, and the mane is of a coarse black color, though Ginny
has braided it with flowers in a desperate attempt to make this mule a
little more beautiful.  But the mule seems happy enough, the eyes that lie
deep in their sockets is rolling happily around, as if to exercise them. 
Well, happy might not be an appropriate word, crazy would be more fitting
probably.  ``

Eastern Prairie~
The sweltering sun hovers low on the horizon, setting the ruddy fields of
wheat ablaze in harlequin colors.  Buffeted by the fickle westerly breeze
of the sea, the landscape sways and swells to the rhythm of the wind.
These gently rolling fields give the illusion of placid bucolity, yet the
prairie would not stand in such fertile glory if not for the unfailing
devotion of its laborers.

Along The Eastern Wall~
`dThe dirt trail is quite narrow here, brambles and tall grasses closing
in on the sides, becoming almost impassable to the south.  The trail is
covered in deep shadows from the high walls, and many small animals hide in
the darkened corners and beneath the overcrowded vegetation.  To the north,
the path widens some as it approaches the forest.

A sod-covered room~
Mounds of mildewed soil hang in clumps from the walls and ceiling of this
simplistic clay interior, forming tiny stalactites and stalagmites in the
corners of the room.  A pile of straw lays under the portlike window, with
a soiled bundle of rags draped over it, forming a crude bedding.  A
shabby-looking ladder leads up to a flat wooden platform above you.

A loft~
The unsteady wooden platform can hardly support the mass of your body and
equipment, groaning in protest as you clamber up onto it.  A rectangular
window overlooks the northern prairie, and a small net in the corner
acts as a makeshift bed for anyone daring enough to sleep on this small
platform.  The shaky wooden ladder leads down to a sod-covered room
below.

Eastern Prairie~
The fields spread out about you, sprawling and uniform. The grain
rises nearly to your eye, swaying and shivering in the breeze. The
green-amber stalks struggle up from the dark, wet soil at your feet.
Occasionally, a field mouse leaps away in front of your steps, searching
for a place to hide among the leaves.

Eastern Prairie~
This field is fallow, weeds and wildflowers scattered among clear patches
of exposed earth. The soil is dusty, pale, used, a few slippery
earthworms slowly churning through it. Bumblebees buzz frantically
between the wildflowers, landing here on a red one, here on a yellow. A
vague powdery haze of pollen fills the air, making your nose itch.

Northern Edge of Eastern Prairie~
You are at the northern edge of the farmlands.  You stand in the midst of
the interminable eastern farmlands of Fierense.  The amber sun gleams
brightly on the flaxen grains of wheat, and you can imagine that after dusk,
these fields are breathtakingly illuminated under the reign of the mystic
moon.  This land blossoms under the guidance of extreme climate, from the
tepid humidity of summer to the liberating harvests of autumn to the dull
grey bareness of winter, and always, to the rebirth of spring.

Grassy Coast~
The prairie slopes down towards the lapping waves to the south, changing
to coarse sand.  Shells and seaweed gather on the beach, spread along an
even line marking the high tide.  The waves are small, having bounced off
the banks of colwyn bay to the west, and ending their path back out to sea
on this beach.

Grassy Coast~
Some grasshoppers chirp and jump out of your way as you move along the
coast.  Dune grass grows tall, clinging in clumps along the beach.  Waves
roll in towards you, crashing onto the gravel and sand, and rising nearly to
the grass before receding back towards the ocean.  A crab occasionally
scuttles along, dashing for deeper waters to avoid the wary eyes of gulls.

Driving the Wagon~
A colorful blanket is draped over the seat, perfect to put over your legs
when you ride the wagon when it's getting colder in the evening.  Every piece
of the wooden frame of the wagon is covered by carvings made by Ginny, it's
mostly carvings of a mule with flowers in the hair, but some are of
butterflies, elks, horses and other animals found in the prairie.  The
reigns are braided ribbons in many different colors, you understand that if
there is a way of coloring something, Ginny will use it.  You look back into
the tented back of the wagon and see painted glass bottles and handcarved
figurines (most of them, once again, in the image of a mule).

earlier?  You were lucky that the voices guided you here, now you can sit
here and play all alone (except for the voices, your friend and all the

else will get to know, this box is YOURS all yours..  Yes..  BWAHAHA!  ``

Grassy Coast~
You stand on a beach of coarse sand and gravel, shifting and wet under
your feet.  The waves, barely frothing white at their tops, fall and churn
the sand leaving behind a shell or a worn piece of driftwood.  To the
north, a prairie stretches as far as the eye can see, tall grasses and tiny
farm houses mixed among the fields.

Grassy Coast~
Water runs up the beach, then wheels and slides back down, leaving a
ridge of sea-foam, weed, and shells.  A humid wind rolls in on top of the
waves, salty and dense with the tales of the open ocean.  The wind flys into
the prairie to the north, bending the grasses and winding through the farms.
A lonely gull rides the wind in and then fights it to circle back out to
sea.  A beautiful `agreystone `cbridge stretches out into the distance
south, where small seabirds circle and whirl over an overgrown island.

Grassy Coast~
You stand on a beach of coarse sand and gravel, shifting and wet under
your feet.  The waves, barely frothing white at their tops, fall and churn
the sandm leaving behind a shell or a worn piece of driftwood.  To the
north, a prairie stretches as far as the eye can see, tall grasses and tiny
farm houses mixed among the fields.

You stand in the midst of the interminable eastern farmlands of Fierense. 
The amber sun gleams brightly on the flaxen grains of wheat, and you can 
imagine that after dusk, these fields are breathtakingly illuminated under
the reign of the mystic moon.  This land blossoms under the guidance of 
extreme climate, from the tepid humidity of summer to the liberating harvests
of autumn to the dull grey bareness of winter, and always, to the rebirth of 
spring.

Eastern Prairie~
The sweltering sun hovers low on the horizon, setting the ruddy fields of 
wheat ablaze in harlequin colors.  Buffeted by the fickle westerly breeze 
of the sea, the landscape sways and swells to the rhythm of the wind.  
These gently rolling fields give the illusion of placid bucolity, yet the 
prairie would not stand in such fertile glory if not for the unfailing 
devotion of its laborers.

Some grasshoppers chirp and jump out of your way as you move along the
coast.  Dune grass grows tall, clinging in clumps along the beach.  Waves
roll in towards you, crashing onto the gravel and sand, and rising nearly to
the grass before receding back towards the ocean.  A crab occasionally
scuttles along, dashing for deeper waters to avoid the wary eyes of gulls.

shade from the sun, a cool breeze blowing among them. Sporadic chirps or
a flapping of wings reveal some crows hiding among the crops, disturbed by
your presence.

Eastern Prairie~
You stand in the midst of the interminable eastern farmlands of Fierense. 
The amber sun gleams brightly on the flaxen grains of wheat, and you can 
imagine that after dusk, these fields are breathtakingly illuminated under
the reign of the mystic moon.  This land blossoms under the guidance of 
extreme climate, from the tepid humidity of summer to the liberating harvests
of autumn to the dull grey bareness of winter, and always, to the rebirth of 
spring.

The sweltering sun hovers low on the horizon, setting the ruddy fields of

These gently rolling fields give the illusion of placid bucolity, yet the

Grassy Coast~
Some grasshoppers chirp and jump out of your way as you move along the
coast.  Dune grass grows tall, clinging in clumps along the beach.  Waves
roll in towards you, crashing onto the gravel and sand, and rising nearly to
the grass before receding back towards the ocean.  A crab occasionally
scuttles along, dashing for deeper waters to avoid the wary eyes of gulls.

Grassy Coast~
Water runs up the beach, then wheels and slides back down, leaving a
ridge of sea-foam, weed, and shells.  A humid wind rolls in on top of the
waves, salty and dense with the tales of the open ocean.  The wind flys into
the prairie to the north, bending the grasses and winding through the farms.
A lonely gull rides the wind in and fights it to circle back to the sea.

The prairie slopes down towards the lapping waves to the south, changing
to coarse sand.  Shells and seaweed gather on the beach, spread along an
even line marking the high tide.  The waves are small, having bounced off
the banks of colwyn bay to the west, and ending their path back out to sea
on this beach.

Along the Eastern Wall~
`dThe slender dirt path tucked into the shadow of the city walls narrows
even more to the south into a nearly impassable bramble of vines and
branches.  Small animals have made their nests under the protection of this
thicket, as you can hear harried rustling coming from the brush as you enter
the room.  To the east, an endless wave of grain sways with the aimless sea
breezes.  ``

as you proceed.  It feels as if the wall is closing in upon you, making you
claustrophobic.  You can see the prairie stretching out far to the east, the
horizon boldly displaying brilliant green and gold.  Your immobility makes
you want to sit and admire the landscape; as it is, the many weeds, tough
ground, and little space make it virtually impossible.  ``

Eastern Prairie~
Giant corn and wheat stalks rise around you, some stretching above your head
towards the clear blue sky. The thick green leaves provide welcome
shade from the sun, a cool breeze blowing among them. Sporadic chirps or
a flapping of wings reveal some crows hiding among the crops, disturbed by
your presence.

Eastern Prairie~
The fields spread out about you, sprawling and uniform. The grain
rises nearly to your eye, swaying and shivering in the breeze. The
green-amber stalks struggle up from the dark, wet soil at your feet.
Occasionally, a field mouse leaps away in front of your steps, searching
for a place to hide among the leaves.

Eastern Prairie~
You stand in the midst of the interminable eastern farmlands of Fierense. 
The amber sun gleams brightly on the flaxen grains of wheat, and you can 
imagine that after dusk, these fields are breathtakingly illuminated under
the reign of the mystic moon.  This land blossoms under the guidance of 
extreme climate, from the tepid humidity of summer to the liberating harvests
of autumn to the dull grey bareness of winter, and always, to the rebirth of 
spring.

Eastern Prairie~
The sweltering sun hovers low on the horizon, setting the ruddy fields of 
wheat ablaze in harlequin colors.  Buffeted by the fickle westerly breeze 
of the sea, the landscape sways and swells to the rhythm of the wind.  
These gently rolling fields give the illusion of placid bucolity, yet the 
prairie would not stand in such fertile glory if not for the unfailing 
devotion of its laborers.

Grassy Coast~
Water runs up the beach, then wheels and slides back down, leaving a
ridge of sea-foam, weed, and shells.  A humid wind rolls in on top of the
waves, salty and dense with the tales of the open ocean.  The wind flies
into the prairie to the north, bending the grasses and winding through the
farms.  A lonely gull rides the wind in and fights it to circle back to the
sea.

Along the Eastern Wall~
`dThis small path is nestled alongside the city walls - manmade, it was
forced into creation by the cityguards who roam its length on watch. 
Resilient and stubborn weeds poke out of the cracks of the huge stone slabs,
fighting for sun in the shade of the gigantic fortification.  Flowing fields
of green stretch east as far as the eye can see, commencing by your feet,
where the brown dirt transforms into brilliant foliage.  ``

A Dirt Road~
`dThis small dirt road winds its way through tall fields of corn, so
slender that you cannot see what lays more than ten feet ahead.  Corn stalks
rustle as you pass by, scaring small critters that were resting in their
shade.  This road continues north through the fields, or south back to the
Eastern Road.  ``

This field is fallow, weeds and wildflowers scattered among clear patches

vague powdery haze of pollen fills the air, making your nose itch.

Eastern Prairie~
Giant corn and wheat stalks rise around you, some stretching above your head
towards the clear blue sky. The thick green leaves provide welcome
shade from the sun, a cool breeze blowing among them. Sporadic chirps or
a flapping of wings reveal some crows hiding among the crops, disturbed by
your presence.

Eastern Prairie~
The sweltering sun hovers low on the horizon, setting the ruddy fields of 
wheat ablaze in harlequin colors.  Buffeted by the fickle westerly breeze 
of the sea, the landscape sways and swells to the rhythm of the wind.  
These gently rolling fields give the illusion of placid bucolity, yet the 
prairie would not stand in such fertile glory if not for the unfailing 
devotion of its laborers.

A Dirt Road~
`dPloughing through the density of the crops that flourish here, you make
your way along this small dirt road.  Its worn surface suggests that it is
moderately traversed, certainly not with the frequency of the main Eastern
Road.  The sun beats down from above, making you yearn to crawl beneath the
canopy of the tall corn stalks.

Eastern Prairie~
The fields spread out about you, sprawling and uniform. The grain

Occasionally, a field mouse leaps away in front of your steps, searching
for a place to hide among the leaves.

Eastern Prairie~
You stand in the midst of the interminable eastern farmlands of Fierense. 
The amber sun gleams brightly on the flaxen grains of wheat, and you can 
imagine that after dusk, these fields are breathtakingly illuminated under
the reign of the mystic moon.  This land blossoms under the guidance of 
extreme climate, from the tepid humidity of summer to the liberating harvests
of autumn to the dull grey bareness of winter, and always, to the rebirth of 
spring.

Along the Eastern Wall~
`d You follow a small footpath in the shadow of the massive stone walls
of Thesden.  There is scarcely any shrubbery here, the ground having been
worn bare by the heavy boots of the cityguards, who wander this path in
pursuit of a few minutes peace.  A few straggly weeds grow from some
crevices in the granite, alongside ivy that is nestled along the base of the
wall.  The towers of the eastern entrance rise up to the south, where
sentries keep watch at all times.  ``

`dYou follow a small dirt path that forks north from the main, heavily

providing a nice canopy through which you travel.  In every direction
surrounding you, crops extend up gloriously to the sky, providing an endless
sea of shimmering color.

roil around the base of the house that stands here.

Grassy Coast~
The prairie slopes down towards the crashing waves to the east, changing
to fine sand.  Shells and seaweed gather on the beach, spread along an even
line marking the high tide.  The air is salty and heavy coming from the sea,
mixing with pollen in the prairie.

Outside the Eastern Gate~
`d Molded by the calloused hands of many peasant laborers, the city gate
looms high above your head to the west, forming an arch that commences at
the bases of the two flanking guard towers.  The distant hubub of the city
rumbles toward you through the fortifications, curling your senses in a
incessant shockwave of pandemonium and motion.  This eastern road plays
humble courtesan to the lively and fickle mistress that is Thesden,
approaching it, yet not violating its demarcations with proper demurral.  ``

The Eastern Road~
`d Through the rolling foothills and the glistening fields of grain, this
road dissects the heartland of central Fierense.  Dusty despite the deep
worn grooven wagon marks upon its surface, the ceaseless prairie winds blow
humid across this thoroughfare, making the air heavy and grimy.  Not far off
to the west, the stalwart towers of Thesden rise up, blending texture into
this provincial countryside.  ``

`dAlong both sides of this dusty road, green grass extends as far as the
eye can see, blanketing the countryside in rolling prairie.  This road
appears to have been heavily travelled if you gauge the depth of the sun
baked grooves of its surface.  In the distance, just beyond the whistling
wind, you imagine you can hear the heavy clodding of workhorses making their
way from farm to market.  ``

caressing the greenery with longing, as if seeking fertility to balance its
aridness.  As the artery of these farmlands, in the early morning even
before the first crow of the rooster, farmers busily hustle along it,
bartering and vending their wares at market.  ``

feet of a hundred farmers walking along every morn and evening.  The road
runs straight east to west, winding past some hills to the west, and
disappearing off into the prairie to the east.  Small farm houses and barns
can be seen scattered among the fields to the north and south.  ``

fields in the prairies east of Thesden - far off to the east the fields meet
the sea, and you can faintly make out the salty scent in the air.  A few
farmers carrying fruits and vegetables to town for sale make their way past
you and off to the west towards the gates.  Deep ruts created by the heavy
wooden wheels of wagons turn off to the south here, cutting a dusty path
through the tall grasses.  ``

and the more populated farmlands.  Fewer red-roofed farm houses can be seen
scattered among the tall grains of the fields, and only occasionally can you
make out a herd of cows or sheep grazing among the grasses.  `` `dA small
dirt path winds around the tall grasses north, while the main thoroughfare
continues to the east and west.  ``

about haphazardly you guess at one time a farm house may have sat at the end

dirt foot path, recently used, winds off into the fields to the south.  ``

You stand in the midst of the interminable eastern farmlands of Fierense. 
The amber sun gleams brightly on the flaxen grains of wheat, and you can 
imagine that after dusk, these fields are breathtakingly illuminated under
the reign of the mystic moon.  This land blossoms under the guidance of 
extreme climate, from the tepid humidity of summer to the liberating harvests
of autumn to the dull grey bareness of winter, and always, to the rebirth of 
spring.

These gently rolling fields give the illusion of placid bucolity, yet the 
prairie would not stand in such fertile glory if not for the unfailing 
devotion of its laborers.

You stand on a beach of fine sand, shifting and wet under your feet.  The
waves, frothing white at their tops, fall and churn the sand leaving behind
a shell or a worn piece of driftwood.  To the west, a prairie stretches as
far as the eye can see, tall grasses and tiny farm houses mixed among the
fields.

Some grasshoppers chirp and jump out of your way as you move along the
coast.  Dune grass grows tall, clinging in clumps along the beach.  Waves
roll in towards you, crashing onto the gravel and sand, and rising nearly to
the grass before receding back towards the ocean.  A crab occasionally
scuttles along, dashing for deeper waters to avoid the wary eyes of gulls.

Water runs up the beach, then wheels and slides back down, leaving a
ridge of sea-foam, weed, and shells.  A humid wind rolls in on top of the
waves, salty and dense with the tales of the open ocean.  The wind flys into
the prairie to the west and south, bending the grasses and winding through
the farms.  A lonely gull rides the wind in and fights it to circle back to
the sea.

Along the Eastern Wall~
`dYou follow a small footpath in the shadow of the massive stone walls of
Thesden.  There is scarcely any shrubbery here, the ground having been worn
bare by the heavy boots of the cityguards, who wander this path in pursuit
of a few minutes peace.  A few straggly weeds grow from some crevices in the
granite, alongside ivy that is nestled along the base of the wall.  The
towers of the eastern entrance rise up to the north, where sentries keep
watch at all times.  ``

The sweltering sun hovers low on the horizon, setting the ruddy fields of 
wheat ablaze in harlequin colors.  Buffeted by the fickle westerly breeze 
of the sea, the landscape sways and swells to the rhythm of the wind.  
These gently rolling fields give the illusion of placid bucolity, yet the 
prairie would not stand in such fertile glory if not for the unfailing 
devotion of its laborers.

Eastern Prairie~
You stand in the midst of the interminable eastern farmlands of Fierense. 
The amber sun gleams brightly on the flaxen grains of wheat, and you can 
imagine that after dusk, these fields are breathtakingly illuminated under
the reign of the mystic moon.  This land blossoms under the guidance of 
extreme climate, from the tepid humidity of summer to the liberating harvests
of autumn to the dull grey bareness of winter, and always, to the rebirth of 
spring.

Eastern Prairie~
The fields spread out about you, sprawling and uniform. The grain
rises nearly to your eye, swaying and shivering in the breeze. The
green-amber stalks struggle up from the dark, wet soil at your feet.
Occasionally, a field mouse leaps away in front of your steps, searching
for a place to hide among the leaves.

Grassy Coast~
You stand on a beach of fine sand, shifting and wet under your feet.  The
waves, frothing white at their tops, fall and churn the sand leaving behind
a shell or a worn piece of driftwood.  To the west and north, a prairie
stretches as far as the eye can see, tall grasses and tiny farm houses mixed
among the fields.

Grassy Coast~
Some grasshoppers chirp and jump out of your way as you move along the
coast.  Dune grass grows tall, clinging in clumps along the beach.  Waves
roll in towards you, crashing onto the gravel and sand, and rising nearly to
the grass before receding back towards the ocean.  A crab occasionally
scuttles along, dashing for deeper waters to avoid the wary eyes of gulls.

Grassy Coast~
Water runs up the beach, then wheels and slides back down, leaving a
ridge of sea-foam, weed, and shells.  A humid wind rolls in on top of the
waves, salty and dense with the tales of the open ocean.  The wind flys into
the prairie to the west and north, bending the grasses and winding through
the farms.  A lonely gull rides the wind in and fights it to circle back to
the sea.

Along the Eastern Wall~
`dYou follow a slender footpath, brushing by the tall wild grasses to the
east, being careful not to scrape yourself against the unforgiving granite
of the city walls.  The path seems fairly well travelled, the heavy
footprints of well armoured people lead off into several directions.  The
bustle of the city floats through the air as a distant murmur, echoing
through these more secluded parts brazenly.  ``

between the wildflowers, landing here on a red one, here on a yellow. A
vague powdery haze of pollen fills the air, making your nose itch.

A small rivulet of water flows nestled amidst the endless fields of
crops.  Named for the sweeping willow tree that stands here stoically, this
creek has become a small reservoir for thirsty animals.  The subdued
whistling of the creek meshes perfectly with the sound of tall grasses
rustling in the breeze.

The lighthouse~
The sturdy walls of this cylindrical room provide a welcome relief from
the strong winds blowing in from off the sea outside.  The room is musty and
unfurnished, save for a padded mat and rough brown blanket which likely
serve as a bed for whoever lives here.  A cast iron staircase spirals up

The ragged wooden walls of the tiny cockpit barely hold steady as you
clamber down into the tiny chamber.  Rusted levers and pulleys line the
floor, and the only clear place to sit is in the square wooden seat
in the middle of the vehicle.  A tiny slit allows you to view the grasslands
outside of the machine, and bolts of huge arrow javelins sit in concave
channels lining the top of the engine.

The staircase ends in a cast iron landing circling the light.  The light
itself is a massive oil lantern backed by a huge silvery mirror, blinding
you as it turns past.  Looking out the thick, dirty windows, endless leagues
of rolling sea are visible to the south and east.  To the north and west,
you see the subtle hills and grasses of the prairie dotted with farmhouses,
and, further off, the walls of thesden with Dunluce castle standing far
above.

Path on the Eastern Prairie~
The fields spread out about you, sprawling and uniform.  The grain rises
nearly to your eye, swaying and shivering in the breeze.  The green-amber
stalks struggle up from the dark, wet soil at your feet.  Occasionally, a
field mouse leaps away in front of your steps, searching for a place to hide
among the leaves.  A winding path cuts through the prairie here, leading
from west to south.

This field is fallow, weeds and wildflowers scattered among clear patches
of exposed earth. The soil is dusty, pale, used, a few slippery
earthworms slowly churning through it. Bumblebees buzz frantically

vague powdery haze of pollen fills the air, making your nose itch.

`dTaking great concentration not to rub against the stone wall, you brush
branches aside to walk along this slender dirt path.  A few lizards dart
across the dusty trail, running to seek shelter in the well covered
underbrush.  ``

You stand in the midst of the interminable eastern farmlands of Fierense. 
The amber sun gleams brightly on the flaxen grains of wheat, and you can 
imagine that after dusk, these fields are breathtakingly illuminated under
the reign of the mystic moon.  This land blossoms under the guidance of 
extreme climate, from the tepid humidity of summer to the liberating harvests
of autumn to the dull grey bareness of winter, and always, to the rebirth of 
spring.

Eastern Prairie~
Giant corn and wheat stalks rise around you, some stretching above your head
towards the clear blue sky. The thick green leaves provide welcome
shade from the sun, a cool breeze blowing among them. Sporadic chirps or
a flapping of wings reveal some crows hiding among the crops, disturbed by
your presence.

Eastern Prairie~
You stand in the midst of the interminable eastern farmlands of Fierense. 
The amber sun gleams brightly on the flaxen grains of wheat, and you can 
imagine that after dusk, these fields are breathtakingly illuminated under
the reign of the mystic moon.  This land blossoms under the guidance of 
extreme climate, from the tepid humidity of summer to the liberating harvests
of autumn to the dull grey bareness of winter, and always, to the rebirth of 
spring.

Eastern Prairie~
The fields spread out about you, sprawling and uniform. The grain
rises nearly to your eye, swaying and shivering in the breeze. The
green-amber stalks struggle up from the dark, wet soil at your feet.
Occasionally, a field mouse leaps away in front of your steps, searching
for a place to hide among the leaves.

Path on the Eastern Prairie~
The sweltering sun hovers low on the horizon, setting the ruddy fields of
wheat ablaze in harlequin colors.  Buffeted by the fickle westerly breeze of
the sea, the landscape sways and swells to the rhythm of the wind.  These
gently rolling fields give the illusion of placid bucolity, yet the prairie
would not stand in such fertile glory if not for the unfailing devotion of
its laborers.  A winding path cuts through the prairie here, leading from
north to south.

This field is fallow, weeds and wildflowers scattered among clear patches
of exposed earth. The soil is dusty, pale, used, a few slippery
earthworms slowly churning through it. Bumblebees buzz frantically
between the wildflowers, landing here on a red one, here on a yellow. A
vague powdery haze of pollen fills the air, making your nose itch.

Path along the Coast~
Some grasshoppers chirp and jump out of your way as you move along the
coast.  Dune grass grows tall, clinging in clumps along the beach.  Waves
roll in towards you, crashing onto the gravel and sand, and rising nearly to
the grass before receding back towards the ocean.  A crab occasionally
scuttles along, dashing for deeper waters to avoid the wary eyes of gulls. 
A winding path cuts along from the west to the east.

Grassy Coast~
The prairie slopes down towards the lapping waves to the south, changing
to coarse sand.  Shells and seaweed gather on the beach, spread along an
even line marking the high tide.  The waves are small, having bounced off
the banks of colwyn bay to the west, and ending their path back out to sea
on this beach.

Grassy Coast~
Some grasshoppers chirp and jump out of your way as you move along the
coast.  Dune grass grows tall, clinging in clumps along the beach.  Waves
roll in towards you, crashing onto the gravel and sand, and rising nearly to
the grass before receding back towards the ocean.  A crab occasionally
scuttles along, dashing for deeper waters to avoid the wary eyes of gulls.

Path along the Coast~
The prairie meets the ocean here, grass changing to coarse sand and
pollen filled air changing to salty and humid.  A narrow path cuts from the
fields to the north to an old white lighthouse to the east.  The lighthouse
sits on a rocky outcropping jutting out into the sea.

At the Lighthouse~
The narrow dirt path that runs out of the prairie to the west opens into
a wide patch of beaten dirt here, only a few small clumps of grass
remaining.  Close to the sea stands an old, weatherbeaten lighthouse, still
standing sturdy despite its many years.  A jetty of large black rocks runs
outpast the lighthouse, disrupting the crashing waves.

A disheveled soil cave~
Filthy wet soil stains the cold mossy walls of this tiny stone encampment,
adding a loathsome stench to the close quarters that seems to hang in the
air permanently, like a cloying mist that clings to you no matter where you
shift to.  Dirtied rags and clothing are stuffed into small, muddy holes,
as if someone had put them there to retrieve later, no matter what their
condition.

A tiny foxhole~
Earthy roots and vines wrap around every possible soil-hold within this
small, entangled cave.  Ivory bones that seem to have been here for years
intermix with the fresh, bloodstained ones that jut out of the ground.  As
you force yourself into the cramped space, you seem to hear faint cries of
discontent from its inhabitants...
