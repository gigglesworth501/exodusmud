The Beach~
`dThe sand is imprinted with bird footprints along the edge of the 
`dwater.  Small holes can be seen when the water disappears back out 
`dinto the ocean. There are small seashells of different colors littered 
`dalong the shoreline.  A slightly cool breeze blows and gives wanderers 
`da chill as they travel down the beach.``

`cInside The Tree``~
`cIt is surprising that a chamber of this size is actually hidden within this``
`ctree. It is warm here and the smell of wood smoke is much heavier than it was``
`cjust outside. There appears to be a hollowed out shaft extending up and out of``
`cthe tree that is allowing the wood smoke to escape, good thing or you might`` 
`csuffocate. There is light dancing off the walls to the north where the chamber``
`cseems to get even a little larger.``

`cInside The Tree``~
`cThis seems to be the largest part of the chamber within this giant tree. It``
`cappears that someone has been camping here for quite some time. A warm fire is``
`cburning, and is the obvious source of the wood smoke. Soft pine boughs have``
`cbeen strategically placed to form a makeshift bed. Some shelves have been carved``
`cinto the wooden walls of the chamber, and a vine growing out of the wall slowly``
`ctrickles water.``

`cThis crack in the huge trunk of this tree is just big enough for an average``

`clarge hole seems to actually enter the trunk of the tree here. There is also``
`cthe slight hint of wood smoke being carried on the gentle breeze. Where could``
