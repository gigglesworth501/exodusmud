multi elemental legion~
Legion~
Legion stands here, fading in and out of the scenery.
~
Legion was a cloud giant mage who delved too far into the
secrets of elementalists for his own good.  His limited
intellect overthrew his skill as a mage, and he was 
trapped in the Elemental Plane of Earth for more than
three centuries.  There, he devised a way to escape,
but only found himself in another Elemental Plane. After
nearly three milleniums, Legion made his way to this world,
Saiya, infused with the essences of all of the planes he
had visited.  Thus he has become the default Master of
Elementals, and serves the Masters of Karin Tower.

Shenlon~
Shenlon, the Ancient Dragon of Saiya, rests here peacefully.
~
Shenlon is huge -- HUGE.  He spans at least 900 feet to either side from
the point where you are standing.  Huge black and green scales alternate
and overlap to form impenetrable armor, and from the looks of it Shenlon
has many other ways to protect himself as well.  If the legends are
correct, Shenlon is both Kami-sama's mentor, advisor, friend, and keeper
of the seven sacred Dragon Balls -- it is said that if all seven are
owned by a mortal, that mortal will have their fondest desires fulfilled.
 
Shenlon looks back at you.  Perhaps he was not as asleep as you thought...

You stare directly at the small ball of fire.
Didn't your mother ever tell you not to look directly into suns?
You are dead!
Okay, not really.
Not many people look at objects, so this is sort of an 'easter egg'.
If you post a public note using the word 'monotreme' in excess of
25 times (not consecutively) to show your knowledge of this secret
mystery, the imps will give you a special prize!!

bible~
This bible is very thin, and only tells a few stories.  The most interesting
ones are the tales of the heroes of Saiya -- Goku, Gohan, and the Masters
of Karin Tower...and how they banded together to help turn back the tide
of evil that threatened the land -- Piccolo, Vejiita, and the Buus -- 
by collecting the seven Dragon Balls and calling on the Ancient Dragon of
Saiya, Shenlon, to aid them in victory.  It goes on to tell how Kami-Sama,
the God of Saiya who watches over all, collected the balls and retreated
to the Room of Spirit and Time to reorganize their scattering.

A Dark Path~
A narrow, rough path is hewn through the miles and miles of endless tall
grass and weeds that seem to have found a home in this place.  The path
seems to lead you northward, but is wide enough to make a retreat should
the need arise.

The endless fields of grass and weeds seem to start to die off here, and the
path you once traveled begins to break into a flattened, unnatural field.  You
can see flattened, cut weeds to your north.

Severed Grass~
All around you, you see three to four-inch piles of scythed grass, flowers,
clover, plants, and even the occasional halved grasshopper.  As you wade
through it, you wonder who...or what...could have cleared this field in
such a precise geometric manner.

difficult.  You are up to your knees in dead greenery.

The foliage grows higher as you progress northward, and empties into
what looks to be a flat circle to your south.

The canopy of foliage dies off very quickly here, and you find yourself in
front of a twenty-foot-across gap in the land.  On the far side you can make
out some sort of large metallic object and a mountain.  The slope seems
*just* horizontal enough for you to begin a descent, if you chose to...

Descent into the Gap~
The fissure actually becomes a fissure at this point -- you are no longer on
stable, flat land.  The grainy texture of the rock underneath you is amazingly
slippery, and the various shoots and roots sticking out of the cliff face
are giving you no help in staying upright.  The slope crevasses deeply down
shortly to your north.

Hovering Above the Canopy~
Barely squeezing through the branches in the canopy, you find yourself
carefully treading along over the top of the foliage.  To your south, and
downwards, you see a huge razed circle of grass -- to your north, you see
a river at the bottom of a huge fissure, nearby.  The branches here are a
bit too unsteady to guarantee you safe passage either direction, though.

The walls on the inside of this cave are the same color and texture as the

Doctor Gero's Laboratory~
Glaring bright lights send strange highlights and shadows dancing across

Cold steam emanates from a gaping hole in the center of the lab.

of it.  Turquoise lagoon water smashes against the rocks, its color almost
out of place for its speed.  Despite the high current, as you look down you
can see various forms of fish and eels fighting to move against the rage to
reach more stable waters.

The Narrow Point~
Here the riverbanks bulge inwards, making the water level rise slightly and
increasing the current to your west.  Eastwards, it looks as if the water
is a little less turbulent.

inlets.  The water teems with life here of all sorts -- creatures overhead,
fish and other waterlife below.

The Cave-Mouth of the Fissure River~
The river slows to a mere trickle here as the water enters into a small cave,
just barely big enough for you to squeeze through.  Apparently, in the cave,
the water picks up speed, but here it is shallow and calm enough for you to
look at your reflection in.

Climbing Down the Watery Cave~
You are on the inside of a small, water-filled cavern, walled in on every
side.  A turbulent pool of dark black water lies directly below you...it
looks as if there are some sort of carnivorous creatures down there by
both the smell of the water and the floating remains that you see atop the
surface.  Maybe it wouldn't be such a great idea to venture down there...?

ramp, which points towards a huge marble construct, Karin Tower.  If you

Here you are waist deep in murky, oily, blood-slicked water.  An immense
undertow lets you know that there is another cave opening somewhere below
you underwater, but the humanlike remains floating on the water also let
you know that it might be VERY unwise to go any deeper.

You are underwater completely now, and can't see much but a blurry light
emanating from your east.  It's hard to concentrate now due to the battering
you are taking from the undertow and jets of water spurting from small holes
in the rock walls...and there also seems to be an entity directly in front
of you, not so much observing as...attacking!

no excuses, you must be in complete awareness of your alignment in conjunction
to the world at large to be able to pass these points successfully.

The Room of Spirit and Time~
The Room of Spirit and Time is the secret location of Kami-Sama, the
God of the Saiyans.  Inside here, one year equals 24 hours of real time.
The gravity is ten times that of the outside, and the air is 1/4 of the
density of normal air.  In here, when a Saiyajin trains, his rage
can increase to a point allowing him insight to the next level of power.
Beware -- staying in this room more than 48 hours is deadly.

would regret it!

A Slippery Tunnel~
A small opening carved from disintegrating stone leads the way from this
stale pool of greenish water into a small cave to your west.  Above you,
peaks of dark stone glimmer in the light, creating an odd sort of
juxtaposition of land, water, darkness and light.

A Steep Grade~
Shale and mica creak unsteadily as you walk over the face of this collapsing
pit of a valley, that seems to lead very deeply into the ground.  The faint
sound of rushing water echoes up from under the surface of the black hole
that stands before you, leading you to the side of caution as you descend.

The Muddy Shore~
Fast-moving whitewater clashes against thick clay sediment, forming a large
dam versus the flow of water here, directing it south.  The ground slants
slowly upwards, leading out of the fissure and into a range of black mountains.
Eastwards, the water rages fiercely.

A Steep Grade~
Large deposits of shale clay and hardened stone form a depression-ramp leading
towards a huge gap in the land below.  A thin bright line of white streaked
with clear and blue shoots out from the pit, spitting foam as it rushes along
a natural course.  Westward you can see the continuation of the huge black
mountain range.

Village Path~
A tiny stone path is etched out of the dark stone, leading down into a
stony blue valley between two snowcapped peaks.  Ragged houses dot the
horizon south of here in the distance, and far south you can see a large
gap in the ground.

A Path Through the Mountain Valley~
A rough dirt path dotted with sprouts of grass and tufts of weeds leads
north, undercutting the Kayinn-Karin pass and dipping down into a green
valley.  Wild and sentient life can be seen to your north, and the road
rises out of the dip to rejoin the mountain range to your south.
