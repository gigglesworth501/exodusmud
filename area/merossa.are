Captain Tylor~
The battle-hardened Captain of the guard scans for enemies.
~
Tylor is a man in his forties, who has devoted his life to the service of
the city of Merossa.  The town guards who work under him know him as a man
of honor who can be trusted with their lives and will fight for the
protection of the city and its citizens.  He stands ready for anything that
can be thrown at him, which is good considering the current state of the
city.

The paladin~
A paladin is here, fighting to defend his town and the church.
~
Six feet tall, blonde, and armour that sparkles like he just finished
shining it.  That is the paladin you see before you.  This young man is in
his late twenties and had just returned from training to find his town under
attack.  His first thought was to defend the church, which is where he is
now.  He is a dangerous threat to any pirate who comes near him.

A pirate raider~
An angry pirate is here, looking for someone to kill.
~
The pirate looks at you with contempt and readies his weapon.  This human has a scruffy beard and reeks of
rum and the ocean.  The clothes he wears are rather nice, but they just look more out of place on him when
you think about the way he must have attained them.  He and his band have sailed into port to sack the town,
plunder all its booty, kill the men, rape the women, and sell the children.

`hVanden Darkblade, the retired `kWarrior Guildmaster `hstands here looking upset.``
~
`kVanden`h is a man in his seventies, which is unusual for someone in his profession.
Even more unusual is the fact that he still has all his limbs, and all in
working order.  His white hair is trimmed short and his skin is tan and
leathery from years of physical work under the `ksun`h.  Despite his age, he keeps
a powerful, while slender physique.  He may be retired, but he could probably
still teach you a few things about combat.  He stands naked from the waist up
and he looks pretty angry as well, as though he was just intruded upon by
someone.

The sullen prisoner wears the garb of a pirate, but looks older than the

physical appearance is probably the reason he was captured rather than
killed.  You have to wonder what his role in all this is...

You gaze upon the lifeless body of what must have been a townsman at one
point.  He does not wear the fighting attire of a guard or a pirate.  He was
probably an unlucky victim of bad timing, having been out in the town as the
pirates attacked.  He must have been killed very recently, as the body still
leaks blood into the fountain in which is is floating.

stones~
It seems odd that you have never noticed these stones before.  They look as if they have been sitting here
undisturbed for years.  The ground around them is undisturbed and the stones have settled comfortably into
the ground.  You can't tell exactly what kind of stone they are made of, but they look worn by time and the
elements and are completely covered in a lush green velvetine moss.  You count five stones in all, and their
arrangement is too perfectly circular to have been natural.  The circle of stones is about three feet across
and very little grows within the circle.

Jail Cell~
This jail cell is pretty small.  A small bench sits against the wall, but
there's not much else as far as comforts go.  A trapdoor in the floor is the
only way in or out.  There is a barred window in the eastern wall, but the
view is nothing more than the eastern town wall.  This is not the kind of
place you'd want to stay in very long...if you had the choice, that is.

Northwest Corner~
You are at the northwest corner of town where the north wall meets the west
wall above your head.  A staircase leads up the wall to the battlements above
you.  Things are a bit quieter here, although you can still hear the distant
sounds of combat and yelling and the smell of smoke is still strong.  Nervous
guards pace the walls looking for a flanking attack, while others run by
heading south to join the battle.

has been spared much of the damage suffered by the docks district...for now,

Northern Gate of Merossa~
The town's massive northern gate is directly to your north and the end of
Ocean lane, which leads southwards towards the harbor and the battles taking
place there.  Citadel street runs east past the Guard's Barracks and west.
Normally open for trade, the gate is now one of the few safe exits for the
fleeing citizens who hurry through, trying to escape the horror to the south.

Guard House~
The guard house is a beehive of activity in the midst of battle.  The wounded
steadily stream in, or are carried in, only to be replaced by fresh forces
heading out to join the battle near the harbor.  Chairs are littered about in
disarray and tables are coverd in maps as the guards map out hasty plans of
attack.

Happy sights are a rarity in thie midst of this tragedy, but you see one now
before you.  You stand in the home of the retired Warrior Guildmaster.  The
house is decorated simply, as would befit a warrior.  A plain bed lies in the
corner and a table with a single chair sits across from it.  Some paintings
hang on the walls and a window in the north wall provides some natural light.

Church street continues along the northern wall, being just south of the
northwertern corner of town.  The street also intersects with main street to
the south, at the west gate of Merossa.  To your east stands the beautiful
town church, which has become one of the last bastions of safety in this
beseiged village.

Church~
The church is eerily quiet, considering the chaos going on just beyond its
doors.  A holy peace pervades the building.  The interior appears untouched,
as though no attacker was willing or able to do harm to the sanctuary or those
within its protection.  Exit to the street are west and south and a smaller
chapel lies to the east.

Chapel~
``You are in a small sanctuary tucked away on the east side of the church. 
`bCandles`` burn in many little `balcoves`` cut into the wall and the `bvisages`` of
several unknown Gods and heroes hang from the walls.  The sweet smell of
incense hangs in the air and you are overcome by a relaxing feeling of
piece, which almost makes you forget about the horror outside.

visages~

Seaside Road~
Seaside road runs north and south through the center of town.  On the northern
end, the road goes out through the northern gate and beyond.  To the south, it
ends at the end of the town's main pier.  The road is also the main avenue for
the movement of both guards and pirates, so if you stay here very long, chances
are you'll be brought into the fight pretty soon.

Town Jail~
The jail is yet another area of town that the town guard use as a rally
point near the front lines of the conflict.  Not many prisoners enter the
doors, as the pirates usually either limp back to their ship, or go down
fighting.  The layout is pretty simple with a single entrance to the east,
through which you can see the road and beyond it, the eastern town wall. 
There is not much of a view from the lobby of the town jail.  Above you, a
stairway leads to the one and only holding cell in town.  A barred door
prevents the unfortunate occupants from wondering out or escaping.

Riverside Lane~
Riverside lane runs north and south along the eastern wall of Merossa. 
To the immediate west is the town jail, where criminals are kept and, more
recently, prisoners of war.  The two-story building is sturdily built and
looks to be many decades old.  Just off to the south is the intersection
with main street, and the eastern gate of town.  Far off to the south lies
the harbor and beyond it, the shimmering sea.

Abandoned Butcher Shop~
While this shop is empty, there's no hiding the fact that it was once a
butcher shop.  The owner must have packed up and moved out recently because
the smell of cooked meat still lingers heavily in the smoky air.  Nothing
remains of the food that was sold here, save for some scraps discarded in a
waste pile.

Boarded-up Weapons Shop~
This weapons shop is deserted.  All the weapons have been removed from
the racks and the door was boarded up.  Most likely, the town guards
requisitioned all the weapons when the pirates attacked.  The shop owner is
probably fighting along with the town guard right now, if he's still alive. 
A half-eaten turkey leg lying on a table shows just how quickly everyone had
to get out when the invasion began.  Through the open doorway, the muted
sounds of screaming and combat can be heard all around.

Western Gate of Merossa~
Merossa's town wall rises above you to the west and continuing to the
north and south towards the sea.  Church street follows along the inside of
the wall and main street leads through the west gate, eventually becoming a
dirt path into the countryside beyond.  Eastward, main street travels into
the heart of town.  Looking east, buildings rise up on both sides of the
street.  Beyond the city to the east rises up the massive volcano that casts
a long shadow over town every morning.

Main Street~
This street is the main avenue of commerce in town.  The road runs from
the west gate to the east gate, and even beyond.  Shops can be found to the
north and south, although many of them are now boarded up or in flames as a
result of the invasion.  Town guards can be seen running in small bands in
the distance and the sound of crackling flames mixes with the sound of steel
on steal and the occasional cry of a vanquished fighter as the battle claims
another life.

Town Square~
This square is the center of Merossa and, during normal times, the center
of the bustle of daily life.  Chaos reigns now, as the battle rages all
around you.  Many nearby shops have been looted and set ablaze and the thick
smoke burns your eyes and offends your nose with its acrid stench.  Several
bodies lie about, some aflame.  The din of battle surrounds you as you stand
in the very center of the besieged town.

Eastern Gate of Merossa~
Looking over the town wall at Merossa's eastern gate, the massive
mountain rising above the jungle is what captures your attention and
dominates the view, blocking out a considerable portion of the sky.  Just
beyond the gate, you can hear the gurgling river as it flows into the sea to
the south.  The calls of birds and other jungle animals nearby remind you
that Merossa is a wilderness outpost never more than a few steps from the
primeval roots of this land.

Ransacked Shop~
The building you stand in used to be a store at some point, although you can no
longer tell what it sold.  The front window has been broken, all furniture has
been destroyed or thrown about the place, and anything of value has been long
since looted by the invading horse.

Boarded-up Armory~
From the looks of things, this shop has been boarded up and barricaded against
the pirate attack.  Since you made it this far, either you forced your way in,
or someone before you did.  The shop appears to be a blacksmith's place of
business, with a furnace in the back, fed by a huge bellows.  A well-used anvil
sits in front of a small bench nearby.  Armor hanging on the walls indicate the
talent of the smith who works these fires.

Merossa Town Hall~
The town hall hasn't been looted...  Yet, but there's no sign of activity
here.  It looks like everyone has either joined up with the town guard of
has left town altogether until the fighting stops.  Several desks are
arranged around the room, giving you the impression this was where the mayor
would normally spend his days reviewing political matters and resolving
disputes and issues of trade.

Church Street~
Church street follows the shadow of Merossa's west wall.  The street
continues north towards the west gate and south towards the piers.  The
smell of smoke is strong in this part of town and the sounds of combat and
death are nearby.  You should stick to the shadows unless you itch for
confrontation.

Seaside Road~
Seaside road runs north and south through the center of town.  On the northern
end, the road goes out through the northern gate and beyond.  To the south, it
ends at the end of the town's main pier.  The road is also the main avenue for
the movement of both guards and pirates, so if you stay here very long, chances
are you'll be brought into the fight pretty soon.

A small seaside cottage~
Locked away form the fighting outside, this tiny cottage owes its
existence to its complete unobtrusiveness from the outside.  None of the
pirate attackers must have paid much attention to a simple-looking cottage
such as this.  On the inside, the cottage is plain, but comfortable, with a
chair and a simple bed along a wall, and a small fireplace against another. 
A door in the south wall leads back to the dim outside.

Burning Tavern~
``This place was a tavern until just recently.  The looting pirates have stolen
anything of value and then set the tavern `iablaze``.  `iFlames`` and `asmoke`` surround
you, making it impossible to breathe and difficult to see.  It's easy to lose
your direction and get lost in the `iflames``.  Occasionally, bottles of high-proof
alcohol explode as they are consumed by `ifire``.  You feel a strong compulsion to
leave quickly.

Broken glass and rubble are strewn around this store.  The shopkeeper has

the port which made it one of the first targets of the pirates when they
sailed into town.  Now all that is left is a burning and destroyed wreck.

for trade in the town's bustling market.  At the moment, though, the only
ship in the harbor is that of the pirate invaders.  Church street runs
northward from here, intersecting with main street off to the north, at the
town's western gate.

overhead and the smell of the salty air rides in on the ocean breeze.  But
now, the sea air is thick with smoke from the burning looted buildings.  The
seagulls are gone, hiding from the onslaught of the vicious pirate raiders
and the only sounds to be heard are those of battle and death, all around
you.

Ocean Square~
Ocean square is the junction of Seaside road and Harbor street.  To the north
a distance is the town's main square.  The largest pier lies directly to the
south, and several smaller piers stretch southward into the water on your east
and west.  Ocean square is also under attack at the moment.  Pirates are
everywhere, looting stores, setting shops on fire, pillaging, and terrorizing
the populace.

also home to a most unwelcome guest at the moment--a pirate ship teeming with
attackers.

Armory~
You stand in the armory of the guardhouse.  Weapons and suits of armor hang in
an organized manner from pegs.  Many sets are gone--most likely in use as the
town guards battle the pirate invasion to the south.  Several wounded guards
have taken up residence in here as well and are tending to their wounds and
trying to recover well enough to rejoin the fight outside.

Outside the Western gate of Merossa~
Just outside the western gate of town, you gain a sense of the panic
going on within the city walls.  The sounds of children crying and women
screaming is mixed with the shouts and battlecries of men engaged in combat.
Abovethe gate, a sentry watches you suspiciously for a moment, then turns
his attention back to the drama unfolding within the town walls.

The Road to Merossa~
You walk along the road to Merossa between crop fields that surround the
western side of the city.  The road leads off to the west where it rounds a
bend and turns southward.  The road also continues eastward towards the
town's western gate.  Your previous suspicion that the fields had been
burning was wrong, but the truth is much worse.  The southern portion of the
city itself is ablaze!

A well-worn road~
As you round yet another bend, the road curves once more, this time to
the east and south.  The road south leads through a meadow and between a
pair of large sand dunes on its way to the beach.  To the east, the road to
Merossa continues towards the large city gates far off to the east.  Above
the town wall lies the thick black haze of smoke.  Perhaps they are
scorching their fields for next year's harvest.

A well-worn road~
The sounds of the ocean are almost imperceptibly faint to the south. 
Your footfalls along the road are the only sounds that break the silence
that hangs over you.  The grass grows tall on both sides of the road and you
scan the skies for birds, but you sense no signs of life in the air or on
the ground.  It's as though every living thing has left the area.  A gust of
wind carries upon is a strong smell of burning wood form the east.

Path around the Bay~
The road to Merossa turns inland to the north into the countryside
between two massive sand dunes, one of which blocks your progress eastward. 
The road also continues to the west along the bay of Merossa.  The ocean
breeze brings the smell of salt mixed with a stronger odor of burning wood,
as though there were a fire not far away.

Path around the Bay~
All signs of civilization seem miles away as you walk along a beachside
road that runs west and east.  The bay of Merossa lies to your south and the
eastern prairie far beyond it.  In the distance to the east, the ocean lies
unseen behind high sand dunes in the distance.  Looking over the dunes
towards what must be the town of Merossa you see a hazy dark cloud and smell
the faintest whiff of...  Smoke?

round yet another turn on the bay.  The beach is a pale white and crystal
waves break against it gently.  The bay of Merossa has been known a safe
harbor for many vessels fleeing ocean storms.  The scent of the sea air is
strong and a gentle ocean breeze blows constantly inland.

Path around the Bay~
The bay of Merossa stretches out before you to the east and beyond it,
the great ocean itself.  Tall dunes block your path to the west, becoming
the foothills of the Kayinn-Karin Shale Peaks, which lie off in the distance
to the west.

Path along the coast~
The packed dirt road you walk upon continues north and east, as it
follows the shoreline of the bay of Merossa.  The sounds of the animals of
the eastern prairie fade away in the distance and are replaced by a quiet
solitude broken only by the rhythmic crashing of waves upon the short.

Path along the coast~
The wide-open expanse of the eastern prairie stretches off to the
southwest.  On your east lies the great ocean, and in between is where you
now stand.  Just to your north, the ocean forms a large bay.  A well-worn
path leads westward along the shoreline of the bay, eventually curving
northward off in the distance.

The river is chest-high here and cool water flows steadily southward,
mingling with the warmer ocean water of the bay.  Farther downstream to your
south is the bridge that leads into the east gate of Merossa.  You can move
on towards it, or you may struggle northward against the current if you
desire.

As the town wall ends in a wide parapet, you hear the sound of waves
crashing against the rocks below you.  To the west is a wild undeveloped
beach.  To the east is the town harbor, which is presently occupied by a
large pirate ship brimming with pirate invaders.  The town guard can be seen
on the streets as well, trying to retake their homes from the attacking
raiders.  The town wall continues only to the north.

locked in case the invaders plan on bringing reinforcements in from outside.
Looking westward, you see only wilderness.  Looking eastward, you can look
along the main road through town all the way to the eastern gate and to the
massive mountain beyond it.  To the north is the northwest corner, with a
passage to the streets.  To the south is where the town wall meets the sea.

of the southern part of town is in `kflames`h and you can clearly see the town
guard engaging in fierce combat with the pirates.``

the town harbor.  This smoke fills the air and the whole southern part of
the town appears to be in flames.  Frantic citizans run about trying to
extinguish the fires, or just trying to escape the pirate onslaught.  Town
guards rush into battle to try to reclaim the streets.  The sound of killing
and battle is everywhere.

When you get your bearings, you realize you have ended up on the
second-story roof of Merossa's guard house.  Somehow you have survived the
catapult launch without any major bodily damage, although a quick glance at
the smashed basket beside you makes you wonder how that was possible.  From
your vantage point, you can see the village stretching out to your south and
a little to your east and west as well.  To your north, you can see the town
wall not far below you.  You could probably even jump down onto it if you
were so inclined, but there would be no way to get back.  There is also a
large nest of some sort up here with you.

`cThe jungle lies lush and green all around you.  The small path you are
on winds its way eastward into the thick and steamy foliage of the jungle. 
To your west, things thin out and you can see a bridge and hear the sound of
moving water.  The greenery all around you teems with motion and the sounds
of life.  Off in the distance, you hear a monkey howl.  You feel a gentle
wind blow from the south rustling the leaves of the plants and trees and
bringing with it the smell of salty sea air.  ``

Jungle Path~
`cThe jungle surrounds you now.  The tiny path you are on disappears into
the undergrowth to your west and continues northward up a small rise where
it turns behind a tree and out of sight.  Thick green leaves hang over the
trail, making it hard to follow at times.  Vibrantly colored flowers emerge
from jungle vines that droop from the trees above your head.  The canopy
above you closes in on itself, blocking out the sun, save for streaks of
light that find their way in as the treetops sway in the breeze, casting
patterns of light and shadow upon the jungle floor.  ``

Jungle Path~
`cYou hear flock of tropical birds fly overhead, but as you look up, you
cannot see them through the thick overgrowth thirty feet above you.  Water
drips from leaves high above and steam rises from the plants all around you.
This humid climate that surrounds you makes the ground spongy and quiet to
step upon.  The sound of the wind through the trees and the ever-present
dripping of water onto broad green leaves masks any noise you might make, or
might hear.  You pause momentarily and look around you, wondering what
predator might be watching you this very moment from the camouflaged safety
of the jungle.  ``

`cThe gradual incline of the trail you walk is beginning to become more
evident as you look northward.  To the south, the trail winds and sinks out
of sight.  The thick jungle still surrounds you, although a broad patch of
sky off to the north indicates a clearing of sorts in the rainforest canopy.
You stop in your tracks and look off to the side as you hear the unnatural
movement of undergrowth that seems to have been caused by something large
nearby.  What you can see of the ground offers nothing in the way of animal
tracks, but in an environment such as this, who is to say a hunter must move
by land?  ``

and catch your first glimpse of just how high you have travelled.  To your
west and south, it's still difficult to see over the treetops, but you can
see the volcano rising up to your north.  A small path disappears into the
jungle to the south, and continues to wind its way up the volcano to the
east.  The ground, no longer moist and springy, now crunches beneath your
feet with a rocky gravel texture.  Smaller shrubs and plants pop up from
place to place, but nothing as thick or as green as you saw in the jungle
below.  ``

The thick jungle has given way to more sparse tree with very little
underbrush as you ascend the mountain.  Looking south, you can see over most
of the jungle to the bay or Merossa.  Beyond the jungle to the west lies the
town of Merossa.  To the north, the mountain continues upward, with a small
path leading both east and west.  No longer enveloped in the rainforest, you
can feel the mountain air blow against you, bringing the slightest hint of a
chill to you.

The path through the trees makes a sharp turn to the north, where it
leads up steeply before turning and levelling off.  The last of the tropical
trees gives way to conifers.  The thick broad-leafed jungle plants have a
hard time surviving at the higher altitudes.  Large rocks and boulders dot
the landscape and the path you walk becomes less worn and starts to resemble
an animal trail.

as you journey high into the mountains.  The evergreen trees become
infrequent at the higher altitudes.  Looking around, you can follow the
trail downward with your eyes winding into the jungle far below.  The
solitude of the moment is broken by the distant scream of an eagle circling
high overhead, signalling an event your eyes cannot see.

`hThe fissure is a deep crack in the surface of the mountain.  Smoke
issues from the opening and you can feel a slight heat radiating from within
as well.  It is wide enough to climb into, were you so inclined, but there's
no telling how far down it goes or where it leads, and you would certainly
have no way back out.  ``

Mountain Trail~
The trail becomes steeper here, as the plants and trees thin out, giving
way to sparser shrubs and low-growing thorny briars.  The trail leads you
onward with semi-fresh footprints of animal and humanoid to follow.  The
trail has been travelled recently and the travellers made no attempt to
disguise their movement.

Mountain Trail~
The grade evens a little here, and you find yourself standing on a small
plateau midway up the mountain.  The trail continues downward to the south
and to the east there is a break in the side of the mountain some distance
away--perhaps a cave.

Mountain Trail~
This part of the trail is a refreshing break from the rugged climb you
had been forced to make to reach this point.  The ground is nearly level
here and a pleasant sea breeze blows constantly from the south.  The trail
runs west and east from this point, with the more itneresting landmarks
being to the east, where the mountain rises high above and a split in the
wall looks large enough to enter.

The winding trail splits here, with one fork continuing up the mountain and
another trail leading east into a small cave.  A wider trail leads down the
mountain to the west.

be the summit of the mountain.  There are only a few scraggly plants that
can survive at this high altitude and none of them grow more than a few
inches above the ground.  The mountain trail leads north and south.

Plateau~
You've done it!  You have reached the summit of this mountain.  Gazing
westward, you can see this mountain is actually a dormant volcano and the
crater in the center has become a lake.  The frigid water is crystal-clear,
allowing you to see down a hundred feet to the floor of the lake far below. 
To the south, a small trail winds down the mountain and out of sight.

Along the crater~
The path has reached the apex of the mountain.  Below, lies a massive
bowl crater with crystal lake in the middle.  A small path winds down the
inside lip of the crater to your north, while a trail works its way eastward
along the top of the mountain.

Along the crater~
Halfway between the lake and the top of the crater bowl, the rocky path
continues to descend to the north, while leading up to the top to your
south.  A chill wind blows constantly here making the waves on the surface
of the lake ripple, reflecting the the light of the sun and moon like a
million tiny mirrors.

Along the crater~
A steep rise to the north causes the path to turn westward as it nears
the surface of the crater lake.  Small plants can be seen popping up through
the rocky soil all around, drawing what nutrients they can from the
life-giving waters of the lake.  The same path continues southward as well,
up the lip of the crater.

Lakeside along the crater~
Waters lap gently against the rocky beach of the lake inside the massive
bowl of the crater at the top of this mountain.  Few plants grow in the
rocky soil here, and the ones that do are small and near the ground.  The
water is cold and clear, allowing you to see down what appears to be at
least fifty feet, which means that it's probably twice that at least.  The
rocky beach continues to the north and to the south.  If you dare, you may
plunge into the icy waters below.  A small path climbs up the lip of the
crater to your east as well.

Cave~
As you step into the cave, the acoustics around you change abruptly.  The
sound of the wind whistling through the trees dies off and is replaced by that
of your footsteps crunching on the loose broken stone, the ubiquitous drip of
water and the occasional squeak of a distant bat.  You can step back outside
to your west, or continue inward to the east.

Mountain Cave~
You are now a good distance beyond the entrance to the cave and the outside
light is minimal at best.  Impressive stalagmites rise from the ground, their
slippery grey surfaces reflecting the persistence of time in this unchanging
environment.  The cave turns slightly here, allowing you to return westward
towards the entrance, or to continue into the belly of the cave to your south.

Mountain Cave~
Moisture hangs heavily in the air here as you look around you.  The cave walls
are covered with crystals and grey sloping mineral flows, residue from eons
of water drops passing over the glassy surface.  From the ceiling hang dozens
of stalactites, some of them thicker than you and longer than you are tall.
Others are so fragile, they would break if you breathed on them.  The cavern
continues north and south, and splits off to the east as well.

Tiny Cave~
The cave constricts towards the south into a very small opening.  As you
approach the hole, you feel the movement of air coming through.  Hundreds
of bats roost above your head, their bodies turning the grey ceiling into a
writhing dark brown mass above your head.  No natural light can be detected
this far into the cave and the flickering of your own light gives you pause
to reflect on how life would be in total darkness.

Widening Cavern~
The cavern widens a little to the south, although not a large opening by
any means.  The flicker of torches to your south throws long shadows on the
walls of the cave and the unknown babbling of some semi-intelligent
creatures breaks the silence around you.  Should you turn back before you
are detected, or do you dare press your advantage with the element of
surprise?

Goblin Throne Room~
The tunnel ends in a modest-sized chamber, which has evidently become the
base of operations for a small group of goblins.  Garbage and random refuse
has been scattered around the room amid broken pieces of armor and weaponry
and bones of the creatres' last meals.  A discarded house chair has been
positioned in a prominent position in the center of the room, ostensibly as
a throne.

As you round this corner, you notice a somewhat abrupt change.  The air in
this part of the cave is much drier.  There are no formations in this part
of the cave and the walls are much smoother and more round in general.  To
the west, the cavern resumes the more traditional look of a cave, while to
the east, the featureless smoth tube-like cavern continues.

Warm Cave~
Your surroundings look wholly unnatural as you glance around you.  You are
standing, not in a cave as you would imagine, but in a featureless black
tubelike cavern.  The walls are black and glassy and almost unbroken in
their featureless continuity.  You can continue onward to the north and
to the west.

The otherworldliness of the cavern is bisected abruptly by a very unnatural
man-made brick and mortar wall which has been put up across the cavern,
effectively blocking all access through.  A single featureless door would
potentially allow access through.  A sign is posted on the wall beside the
door stating its intentions in no uncertain terms.

darkness beyond the range of your light.  This part of the cavern feels
noticeably warmer as well.

Sulphur Cave~
You stand in a perfectly round featureless black tubular cavern which seems
to stretch unbroken and unchanging off into darkness both to your north and
to your south.  This unending moebius is interrupted only by the warm breeze
which blows from the north, bringing with it a stench of sulphur.  You feel
as though you are descending into the very pits of hell itself.

Sulphur Cave~
The unbroken tube continues to the north and the south.  Nothing seems to
have changed and you wonder if you are making any progress.  The smell of
sulphur hangs strong in the air and you feel the faintest tremble in the
floor of the cave around you occasionally.  Maybe it's just your mind at
play in the sensory deprivation of this unending tunnel.

The smell of sulphur is very strong now.  The glassy wall of the cave tube
is broken in several places where strong tremors have shaken pieces loose.
To your north, you can detect a faint red glow in the distance.  To the
south, you see only darknes as the tunnel stretches off into infinity in a
perfect cylinder.  The ground shakes beheath your feet, not violently enough
to throw you, but enough to make you take stock of your surroundings.

Sulphur Cave~
As you look westward, the lava tube opens into a giant underground cave. 
The entire cavern glows yellow from the bubbling lake of lava below.  A thin
bridge of stone leads west over the lake to a rocky island of sorts in the
center of the lake.  Thick plumes of sulpherous steam make it very difficult
to breathe in here and almost impossible to see what lies beyond the bridge.

Bridge over Lake of `iFire``~
Shades of yellow and red swim before your eyes and heat shimmer bends the
lines of the small stone bridge you stand on.  All around, the lake of fire
spreads as though you have left reality behind and stepped into the gate of
hell itself.  You may turn back now, and head east towards an opening in the
rock that offers protection from the intense heat that bathes you and makes
your armor burn your flesh.  To the west lies an island in the middle of the
lake of fire.  The bridge ends abruptly, but you could probably make the
jump to the island, although you would have to find a different way off of
it.  The island is mostly shrouded in a haze that makes it impossible to see
what is inside.

A thick smoky haze makes visibility difficult on this rocky island.  To
the east lies an almost unending sea of fire and lava.  The only choice one
has is to go west into the smoke.  Taking stock of your options, you notice
deep scratches in the rock all around you, as though wagonwheels have left
an indellible impression in fresh mud.  Your attention is broken by feel of
air moving about you and swirls in the mist.  You are not alone.

The haze is so thick here you can barely see your hand held out in front
of you.  Noises in all directions play with your senses and the ever-present
heat wears away at your body and mind.  Surely nothing would choose to live
in this environment.  Therefore either nothing is here, or whatever is, was
put here against its will.  A low growl reminds you that now it not the time
nor the place for introspection.

Bottom of the Lake~
Even at over a hundred feet below the surface, the crystal clear waters
allow bright sunlight to play games with light and shadow upon the brown and
green bottom of the lake.  Looking up, it's hard to discern exactly where
the water stops and the sky begins.  A glint in the corner of your eye
entices you to swim over and examine what turns out to be a chest, mostly
buried in the sand.

Under the Crater lake~
Swimming around underwater, the lake spreads out in all directions almost
invisibly, giving you the appearance of swimming in nothing, save for the
frigid reminder that clings to your body at all times.  You know it's
dangerous to stay in these waters for more than a few minutes at a time, and
you can already feel your muscles tightening, struggling to function as the
life-giving warmth is drawn away.

Surface of the Crater Lake~
The crystal waters are feel as cold as ice, and are probably only a few
degrees above it.  Looking into the depths, distance is immeasurable.  It
seems like you can see a hundred feet below you, though you know it must be
four times that.  Fish swim all around, keeping a safe distance, yet
straying close enough to satisfy curiosity.  Was that a sparkle you saw far,
far below on the bed of the lake?
