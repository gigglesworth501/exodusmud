Change to Throwing Skill: 
if your dexterity is < 21 or your charisma is low,
there is a % chance that the mob will attack you even if you miss the throw.

Subject Thief Skills~
Text
Sigh I just accidentally deleted my last change.
Changes made to all thief skills (throw, assassinate, backstab, kai, circle)
for all these skills, if your skill % > 75, then your wait_state is decreased by one.
For backstab and circle, the wait_state was reduced one in addition,,,
So in general, thieves should be more wily and agile.

Hi all...

As you are probably aware, Exodus is undergoing a lot of change these days.
The pfile wipe of inactive players is well under way, and some of you 
have commented on the changes to certain areas... Well, this note is just
to let you know we are still working on changing things. More areas
will be revised after the pfile wipe ends, and our code is being revised.

As far as coding changes, clan code and the remaining lag bugs
are the major projects being worked on, with smaller bugs being fixed
as time allows. Clan code needs a major rewrite, so that's under way. 
When the new code goes in, expect the old functionality back plus some 
nifty new stuff, some of which I'm hoping to get player council opinion 
on (hint hint, player council members!).

After new code is in, also expect to see some rules revision pruning
some and perhaps clarifying on a couple of points.

Thanks,
Imm staff.

Subject Enhanced 'set' command :-)~
Text
Ok you may be aware that you can set eq flags by doing the following :
set obj spear extra <numeric compound flag> so spear extra 4 or something like that.

the problem is this is a royal pain... you have to figure out the
numeric equivalent for each flag and then add them together...

so I decided to allow you to do set obj spear extra flag1 flag2 flag3 ...
so you can now just specify the names of the extra flags.
so you could do set obj spear extra dark glow hum   if you wanted

Right now this only works for setting extra flags on an object.
I wanted to make sure the approach worked before I added it to the other flag fields.

Two key things about this :
One, the old format is supported as well if you really want to use it. 
so you can do set obj spear extra 4 or say set obj spear extra dark
it's up to you.
2) if you use the numeric value, you are setting the flag field to that value.
if you use the actual flag name(s) you are toggling those flags.

I hope to add extra fields and bells/whistles to this in the future.

Hello all!

As promised, here is a change note detailing the code changes 
that went into effect with the new code and site. My apologies 
for the amount of time it took to get this to you. 

1. Grouping: Racial grouping restrictions have been hardcoded. 
This was previously a law, it's now hardcoded so it's clearer. 
2. Grouping: "Spheres" of alignment restrictions are in place. 
You may group with anyone within 600+/- of your align. 
Note this may limit a group's members. 
3. Mage/Bard Charm: Level restriction of +/-10 levels for PC's,
same as for use of magical "thingies" (no, don't show us yours)
NPC limit is 10+, no limit on NPC charm down. 
Max of 8 direct charmies for bards or mages. 
4. Mage/Bard Sleep : Level limit of +/-10 for PC's. 10+ only for NPC's.
5. Clan stuff : It works. Ummm...Clan leaders are the only ones
who existed by default when we opened again, so you may need to 
reapply to your clan. Clan list now shows deputies. A few 
other odds and ends.

Please let us know if you find any bugs, we will 
try to have them fixed as soon as we can. More 
changes as we get them in, including more clan stuff, and features.

Subject Attacking Noclans & Noclans attacking loners/clannies~
Text
It has been brought to my attention that now and then, a noclan may give 
their blessing to a loner or clannie to attack them.  Unless this is to 
remove the affects of spell like 'sleep' to wake a person up, this needs to
stop.  Newbies get the wrong idea when they see noclans and clannies attacking
each other.  Other people who weren't there when permission was given also
get the wrong idea and report it all to immortal.
If you want to practice a skill or spell, do it on a mob.  If you're a loner
or clannie, practice on another loner or clannie.  Noclans are offlimits.
Likewise, if you're a noclan, loners and clannies are offlimits (except for
waking them up).  Appropriate penalties will be given out (such as loner flags)
for those who do not follow this.


A side point:  this also relates to a blurb in the rules regarding 
non-aggressive spells.  Noclans still do not have permission use any skill
spell, prayer or song on another noclan, loner or clannie without their
permission, whether the spell or skill is aggressive or not.  This also applies
to clannies and loners in regard to noclans.

If anyone has a question about the policy, please feel free to note me or 
Malakai and we'll be happy to try to answer it as best we can.

Subject Appropriate Language on Channels and the Note Board~
Text
A recent controversial note has gotten many people to question what is and what
is not appropriate to say on the note boards and on channels.  
Unfortunately there is no hard and fast rule regarding what is vulgar and what
is not.  The question of vulgarity has been something debated throughout the
ages whether the subject is literature, sex, religious beliefs, cooking and
a variety of other things.  It all comes down to that vulgarity is in the
eye of the beholder, much as beauty is in the eye of the beholder.

As much as some of you are disappointed, Exodus can not be run as an anarchy.
As such, certain guidelines need to be laid down regarding the use of 'vulgar'
language.  Basically it comes down to this:
If an Immortal is offended by what you say over open channels and feels that
what you're saying is vulgar, you may be nochannelled for it.  If the immortal
gives you a warning first and asks you to stop, they did you a favor instead
of simply no-channeling you first.  Whether you use symbols or not in what
you say makes no difference.  This also applies to vulgarity in languages
other than the English one, for all of you bi-lingual folks out there.
In addition, this applies to the note board.  What you say will be taken in
context, whether it is on channels or on the boards.  We *ARE* trying to make
Exodus open to more RP and as such, the Immortals will be asking themselves
just whether what you've said (if they consider it vulgar) is in RP or not
and whether it should slide or not if they feel that it IS in RP.

As much as some feel to the contrary, the Immortals here have been appointed
Imms for their good judgement and character.  Because of this, I'm confident
in how they will handle matters such as these.  As always, if you feel you've
been treated unfairly, questions may be addressed to me.

On a similar note, this policy regarding vulgarity is not limited to public
says, use of channels, or the note board.  This also applies to tells 
(aka Harrassment).  If a player feels that they are being harrassed and tell you
so, please stop.  If you continue and they notify an immortal, after investigating
the immortal may find you guilty of harrassment and you may be jailed, frozen,
have your channels taken away or whatever else the immortal deems necessary to
stop the harrassment from continuing.

These rules are in place to attract people to Exodus.  Yes, they are restrictive
however it is felt that as much as they seem restrictive, they are also conducive
to a larger MUD population.  

My last thought on this matter is, use your common sense.  For the most part
most people's views are pretty much the same regarding what is and what is not
considered vulgar.  If you think an immortal is going to think something you
say is vulgar even if you don't think it is, then don't say it.
There will be times when you feel that something you've said wasn't vulgar and
didn't think anyone else would think that too.  In those cases, I implore the
Imms to take that into consideration when rendering judgement.
If you are concerned about what would be considered appropriate and inappropriate
to say, perhaps it would be best to run it by an Immortal before you broadcast
it, in those cases where you are unsure.  We'll be glad to help in any way
we can.

Thank you for your time and patience.

Subject New Exodus Build on Sunday 6/26/1999~
Text
I have been notified by Akamai that a new build will be installed on the date
listedn on the subject line.  Below is a summary of the changes that will
directly affect gameplay:

Cleric Prayer, 'Evocation' has been changed so that characters cannot be 
summoned into ocean rooms anymore.

Whena  character is promoted to hero, he/she will automatically gain only the
spells/skills that they did not already have from their own particular class.
Additional spells and skills outside of their class may be gained by typing
'gain list' at their guild hall teacher and then paying the appropriate amount
of trains for whatever spell/skill group they want to gain.

Linkdeath has been changed so that the tick timer on wanted and jailing flags
does not continue to tick down while a person is linkdead.

As requested by players, note boards will be changed.  There will no longer
be a 'note' board.  The boards players may now post on will be 'oocnote',
'poetry' and 'rpnote'.  PLEASE try to keep OOC notes on the OOC board and 
RP notes on the RPBoard.  I would be willing to consider a change in policy
regarding use of expicatives on the RP board (ONLY) if everyone would post
their notes to the appropriate boards.  (Feedback on this proposal is welcome).

One other change to the board posting is that characters must be level 15 to
post notes to 'all'.  This will prevent a scourge of 'flaming' notes by 
hastily made, anonymous, level 1 alts.

Changes to Bards' "The Piper's Melody" will hopefully make things a little
easier than they have recently for Bards to charm mobs, provided that key
stats are maxed on bard characters and that certain pieces of gear modify the
max. natural stat value higher.

Lastly, it's my pleasure to announce that class and race specific object flags
will be going in, which means that soon new objects will be appearing that 
can only be used by specific races and classes.

A big round of thanks goes out to Akamai, Shinowlan and the other coders
responsible for these changes and the behind the scenes changes made to remove
bugs and cut back on memory usage.

FYI:  The build will go in *sometime* on Sunday.  I do not have an exact time
when the changes will be made on that day.

Subject Clan Gear in Thesden Equipment Depot~
Text
After hearing many reccomendations from mortals and immortals alike, I have
drastically reduced the price of clan gear.  Because the stuff is rot_death
and basically not droppable/removable and that clannies die much more often
than noclans, I lowered the price to make clan gear more affordable.
This was done at the request of many of you, as well as the new clan Admin, Stratis.

Subject Non-Pk Clans: Advocaction, Greenwood, Merchants~
Text
Pursuant to a MUD-wide meeting held a few weeks ago, a decision has been made
regarding the management and handling of non-pk clans on Exodus, as well
as policy changes regarding the creation of new non-pk clans.

The following describes how non-pk clans will be handled:

1) Non-pk clans must actively participate in some form of community service.
This can include helping newbies or running small quests (with or without imm help).
For a clan to be considered actively participating in community service it
does NOT mean that only one clan member does this and the rest do not.  There
must be at least a 50% participation rate with a clan's members for that clan
to remain non-pk.  Failure to do this will result in the removal of the non-pk
status of the clan and hence, the lonering of the clan's members.

2) Non-pk clans may NOT accept loners or members of pk clans into their ranks.

* 3) Non-pk clans may not have clan gear.

+ 4) Non-pk clans may not overlap in membership qualifications.  This means
there will only be one non-pk clan that accepts good aligned syvin rangers,
only one non-pk clan that accepts evil dwarven thieves... etc.  Non-pk clans
still are subject to the 7 point rule of clan membership, however, unlike their
pk counterparts, each clan will be completely different as to their membership
makeup.



*  Non-pk clan members have 30 days to return their clan gear to me.  Those
that do so will receive their money back for what they spent on the gear
plus an additional 50% for their trouble.  After the 30 days, any remaning 
clan gear will dissolve within 1 tick of a character logging on.  No monetary
reimbursements will be done after the 30 days.

+  Non-pk clans that currently do have overlapping membership 'points' will
be contacted so as to re-arrange their current membership.  Those that fit
into other non-pk clans may choose to join them, become noclanned or they can
go loner (or join a pk clan).

If you are of a race/class/alignment combination not supported by any active
non-pk clans (and you are currently a noclan), you may try to form your own
clan, provided that you are willing to continually satisfy the community service
requirement and can come up with an original (and appropriate) rp stance for
your clan to follow.


Questions can be directed to me or Stratis.

Subject Clan Gear~
Text
It has been brought to my attention that the base flags on clan gear prior to
a clan adding and deleting flags as is their option, was not the same across
the board for each and every clan, resulting in some clans having extra flags
than others.  In this particular case, the flags in question were 'EXTRA' flags
and not value (v0-v5) flags for those of you builders out there.  Some clans
had melt_drop gear and others did not, for instance.  I have change clan
weapons so that they are no longer no-uncurse, no-drop or melt-drop.  All clan
weapons will be the same in that respect now.  (Clans were not given the option
of these flags such as whether their weapon was to be melt-drop or not).

Subject coded NonPK protection~
Text
Hi all

Even though i know that the NonPK protection that we have discussed slightly, has not been
agreed upon at all, i went ahead and coded something like it, since we haven't agreed upon it
i added it with a toggle, named "safe_nopk" ... without using that command, the mud will function
more or less the same as before, except for imms being unable to attack mortals, and mortals
unable to attack imms.... If you would like to test it out, do go ahead and test it, however
for us to have a total, complete NoPK protection system, we will have to decide which spells
should be deemed aggie, plus we need to start using the clan type flag, i.e. Advocation would be
type CLAN_EXPLORER, and other clans would be type CLAN_NORMAL_PC....

This is not an attempt to do things without being allowed, it is more of an attempt to show
what it is that _I_ think NoPK protection should be like...

Yours truly!

Subject PK/NonPK~
Text
Hello

The PK/NonPK protection code is now fully functional, and because of that, from now on
"clan list" shows PK status of clans as well as the usual stats...

Using "clan establish", you from now on need to define the status of the clan, i.e.
clan establish test test pk establishes a pk clan named test with the symbol test, and
clan establish test test nopk establishes a nonpk clan with the same name and symbol

From now on, you can't loner before level 9, and you can't attack or be attacked by
other players, unless you are in a PK clan or have a loner flag... The only exception is
when you are duelling, when duelling, the protection is absent.

I would very much like it if y'all discussed which spells/skills should be deemed aggie
of those who aren't already.

A new option has been added to "set", namely "set clan" with the values pk or nopk
for changing a clans status from PK to NonPK or the other way around.

Subject Clan Gear Changes~
Text
The Admin team has discussed how clan gear will be handled in the future.  
As it stands, the existing clan gear will be set to crumble at a date to be
announced.  HOWEVER, please note, that new clan gear will be put in for each
clan to take advantage of.  The cons of this is that the gear will not give
clannies any edge over another from a levelling or PK standpoint, meaning no
stat modifiers, weapons that are any better than weapons already in the game,
... etc.   The pros of this is that it has not been decided as of yet what
will go in to replace the existing gear.  Three pieces of gear will be available
to each clan, the cost being very minimal -- only a fraction of what it costs
to buy clan gear now.

One proposed piece of gear is a drink object container that has unlimited sips
of a drink.  It will never need to be filled.

Another proposed piece of gear is a lockable container that can hold heavier
gear than containers out there now.  It has even been proposed that the container
be floating, to free up the (held) equipment space.

Please note:  I will announce a week or two in advance when the gear will be
changed and the new gear will be available.  Your help in coming up with new
gear would be greatly appreciated.  Ideas regarding this that meet our criteria
of not affecting player stats and PKing, should be posted on the Idea board.

get when they kill mobs.  An indicator at the bottom of the "Who" list shows
"Quadruple Exprience is On!" when the MUD is in Quad Exp mode.

Currently, the command is set to run for 40 ticks (approx. 30 minutes).  Any
character logged on during that 30 minute period will gain the increased exp.

Morgan will be changing the functionality shortly so that we will be able to
specify # of ticks as an optional parameter.  If no parameter is indicated,
the default is 40 ticks.

Morgan will also be adding a # of ticks left indicator to go along with the
one on the "Who" when Quad_Exp is running.

An additional enhancement that Morgan will be adding is a gecho message when
the Quad_Exp timer runs out.


It would probably be a good idea to use this sparingly.  Quadruple Experience
really is a lot.  We could advertise that a Quad_Exp quest will run in X
number of days... etc.  I think in that way we would pull in more players on
quest nights.

Subject New Skills/Spells/Prayers/Songs~
Text
Several changes have happened recently to skills and spells in Exodus.  I will
try to address them as they occurred.  First off, Clerics have two new healing
prayers.  Greater Heal has double the effects of a normal heal prayer at double
the mana cost.  Restore will heal anyone or anything to full health, but costs
500 mana.

Warriors have a new skill, stun.  Stun is similar to kai in that it can break
mirrors, but I can't tell you too much more about what it does right now...

Bards have a new song called 'Song of Shattered Dreams' which is a very high-
level song for bards that deals out a mean hurting and has a chance of breaking
mirror, but is somewhat costly.

As always, please send any praise, ideas, praise, complains, or even praise to
immortal because I'm sure some of these are going to need tweaking and tuning.
Keep your eyes open.  More changes to come...

BTW, as a result of new skills and spells going in, several things like wands,
parchments, and maybe other things, have been messed up.  Please report these
to me so I can fix them promptly.  Well, you may be S.O.L. on your parchments,
but it's worth a try, eh?  :)

There have been afew changes to the guildmasters.  First off, Ivan now has a

have drastically lowered the damage he does on normal hits.  It's now on par
with a Thesden Guard--hard hits, but not insane.  Also, Ivan's AC is only
half as good as it was.  Additionally, he is now vulnerable to something he
was previously unaffected by.  Lastly, Ivan, Vanya, Alderra, Godfrey, and
Vedros will remember you if you walk back in after fighting them.  This
sounds mean, but actually, it's a benefit for the player since you dont have
to deal with the initial attack or the self-preparation that they do while
you taunt them.  Zeryn and Isaac still require taunts because, well, it's

Subject MULTIKILL~
Text
Some people have been mis-reading the multi-kill rule, it is a bit vauge i agree--
Ill try to make this as short and easy as i can....
The main point i want to clear is the fact that even if you dont get the KILL, but ARE assisiting, that your are considered a killer, and may not kill the person again without due time.
Also, SUMMONING someone, and just watching them get killed, is INDIRECT PK if you summon, you have to assist or be indirect.
Also, time between kills should be at least 10 minutes, no summoning(unless to retrieve corpse or asked), and no killing.
At the moment, this isnt coded in, i hope to get something coded in to help prevent MK, 
With this comes the excuse "I didnt know he was just killed" This is most likly a bad excuse...most people make it known they have just died, clans/allies will most likly be communicating about a score or death, and lastly, IMMS will be watching
And of course there is the trivial way....LOOK at a person...naked and clinging to life....maybe they just died? 
my last point for this note....ALL clans will be heavily watched, NO-CLAN pkrs as well, The immortal staff will be watching all pks closely.  Punishments may be more harsh than usual. Take this into mind before you decide to break a rule.

p.s.  ok...so its not to short...any questions, note me i will try to clear it up.

I added a few scripts to the game here.  One in particular makes the Goddess

Also, in the forest, if you are in the right place at the right time, you may
notice some environmental echoes going on.  This should not affect gameplay at
all, as it's purely an rp thing.  This one is just kind of fun.

I put in a script that goes along with the Carlysle quest I've been working on
for what seems like forever.  The quest isn't finished so you probably won't
notice anything going on there yet.

Also, Shenlon has a script.  Relax, he doesn't fight any different.  He just
tries to wake himself up every now and again.  Clearly, if he's under the
influence of the sleep spell, he will not be able to wake up.  I'm sure you

New skill: Sap (Level 80, assassin only)
A victim with detect magic gets a warning when a portal is opened to him/her.
Cannot backstab a hurt opponent.
Cannot use camouflage while in combat.
Cannot follow while camouflaged.
Cannot use Hide in combat.
Players can no longer train hitpoints (you knew it was coming)
Can no longer enter portal books from rooms with the no_transport flag.
Rangers now get Dual Wield at level 25 instead of 18.
Call lightning is more powerful and you now direct it at the target.
Removed weight influence in bash (100k on you shouldn't help you bash now)
Edification can no longer be scribed.

Enhanced Damage lowered to level 20 for Assassins.
Assassins had two prayers but could not pray.  The prayers are gone (typo)
Fixed assassin pk protection so that newbies under level 10 are protected.
Unclanned Assassins are forced loner at level 10.
Added more appropriate messages for non-Sidhe's who use mask.
Added new non-forest messages for when Assassins use entangle.
Train mana disabled (at the behest of Regen)
New Assassin/Warrior skill Critical Strike (See help file)
New Assassin skill Eviscerate (help file visible as of next boot)
Assassins now get Dual Wield at 68 (mostly in preparation for eviscerate)
Trip now lags the user and the victim for two rounds apiece.
The above change to trip should also help with the much-abused trip/kill bug.
Assassins can assassinate with any kind of weapon, unlike thieves.
Changed backstab (again) so that it's a lot closer to how it was before.
Assassins no longer get to enter other guild halls.  Sorry guys.
Assassins now have their own guild hall.  It's in Ebon Downs.  Look for it.

The Elf and Syvin help files are now a little more accurate--Don't worry,
``     Syvin are still the master race  :/
Critical Strike should be completely operational now.
Teleporting a mob has a very small chance of angering it.
Players cannot stock keys that are flagged as no-save (duh!)
Anouen is a little smarter (not by pumping his stats) and his gear pops a

Maximum level for assistance from the drifter is 20 instead of 10 now.
Also, a new skill's in the game, but it's still being tested and tweaked, so
``     no class has it yet.  I'm just telling you so you know additions are
``     happening.

I'd like this to become a theme with the "boss" mobs of the game.  The gear
is more common, but the mobs fight smarter.  That way I can justify leaving
the best gear in the game mostly unaltered without giving free rides to sly
players.  Additionally, dedicated players wont have to wait for a reboot for
great gear to pop.  Also, I'm continuing to update the eq and armor in the
game.  I've taken pretty much everythnig down to scale and now I can start
adding back some of the popular advantages of certain items as long as it has
a balancing disadvantage.  The biggest victims will be all-around great gear
like the suit of armor, which has great ac as well as bonus.  Suggestions

Subject since we're enforcing rules strongly now...~
Text
Help Immortal Laws - everyone needs to read this file and be more careful.

If we're going to enforce this for one offense, we need to all start
following it a lot more closely.  Nobody has done anything majorly wrong,
but we are way too lax on the little things.  It comes across as favoritism
to certain players and after a while, people expect it.  That's not right.

Here's some specifics that we have all gotten bad about (including me):

Giving quad when players ask for it.  (this should NEVER be done)

Giving a restore when players ask for it.  (also should not be done)

Telling players how many hp a mob has left.  If you want to give them
encouragement on a hard mob, use general terms like "You're making good
progress" or "you're getting there"

Telling players how many ticks of jail they have left.

Teleporting players around the world unless it's for a specific imm reason.

Loading mobs or resetting areas for players--even if it's just resetting
the zoo for newbies.

Loading items for players--even if it's just useless items for newbies
I consider Iverath's newbie box an exception to this rule.

Giving nobility/pretitles to players for no good rp reason.  Nobilities
are reserved for rp.

Helping players get their corpses back.  If someone dies in a bad place,
tough luck.  Exceptions for newbies (not alts) under level 10.

Also, I want to crack down on alt-switching.  Re-read the multiplay rules
and let a player know if he is doing something you don't like.  You have
authority to tell a player not to do something, even if it's not specified
in the rules.  If the player does not like it, then tell them to take it
up with a higher-level imm or an admin.

These are just the rules I can think of right now.  There are probably more.
There will always be exceptions to these rules.  Just ask yourself if you
could justify your actions if a high-level imm saw you doing it.  That
should help you determine right from wrong.

Text
Amid all the excitement and scrambling to patch little leaks and squash little
bugs, it became apparent that i had never formally introduced the reavers as a
new guild.  Reavers are somewhat similar to anti-paladins in that their entire
society revolves around their devotion to the forces of evil.

Reavers have an excellent help file that is kind of a long read, but it's full
of useful info, especially if you're planning on playing one.  Reavers were a
big project and I need to give some credit here.  Xeroth did the vast majority
of the work designing and coding the guild.  I playtested a lot, did a little
coding, and kept everything on theme.  Paarshad put some strong finishing
touches on the project and has helped tremendously during bug-fixing.

Also, there are a few other changes that have gone in.  The list is as follows:

You cannot butcher unless you have the skill.  The good news is that if butcher
is really this important to you, every class can get the skill.  I didn't like
the way the skill had come to be used (or not used as it were) so I got it back
on the track of making meat.

I slightly improved chances of throw successfully hitting the target.

I changed trip so that user lags a bit longer than victim.

I added functionality for no_charmie rooms.  This is mostly going to be used
to keep charmies out of rooms that have to do with specific quests.

I disabled 'showstats experience'.  If you don't believe me, try it!

Subject Sidhe Reavers~
Text
I have disabled the creation of Sidhe Reavers.  Furthermore, I am going to be
phasing out existing Sidhe Reavers.  Let me start with an explanation of how I
came to this decision.

First off, Sidhe and Reavers are a good match rp-wise since they both revolve
around evil.  The only real rp issue here is that Sidhe are not allowed to make
become members of warrior-type classes (except Thieves)  There are two major
concerns that have brought me to this conclusion.  I'm not going to try to win
over any Sidhe reavers because there's no way I can convince someone who has
life so good that getting rid of him/her is the right thing to do.  Onbiously
they are a popular choice because about half the existing reavers are Sidhe.
The word has clearly gotten out.    :)

Problem #1 is that Sidhe are permanently at -1000 alignment.  This is a
tremendous boost as a reaver because burst spells do damage based on the
reaver's alignment and blade spells have duration based on the reaver's
alignment.  Obviously, if your alignment never changes, it's always going to be
perfect for maximum effect regardless of what you kill.

Secondly, and most importantly, is Sidhe immunity to blunt attacks.  There's
just no getting around this one.  While other reavers have to scratch and claw
for precious soul energies, a Sidhe can just walk into Erion abbey, push all
the novices into one room, and walk away from the computer for half an hour
to end up with 300 extra souls.  I'm not saying this happens, but the fact
that it could happen is unacceptable.  I tried to be very deliberate and
careful in picking the price of upgrades, and for non-Sidhe, they seem to be
expensive enough to make the upgrade process gradual.  But for Sidhe, the
upgrades are far too easily and quickly attainable.  In under a week, we have
had at least one Sidhe who was able to improve his blade to the level of the
best two-handed weapons in the game.

So, no more Sidhe Reavers.  The challenge now is to determine what happens to
the existing Sidhe Reavers.  Even though it has not even been a week, some
people have invested many hours in their characters.  Letting them do a total
remake into a new race is one option, but how much of their souls should be
reimbursed?  If I reimburse it all, the situation really isn't any better than
it is now.

I'm open to suggestions...

Text
Here is a brief (and likely incomplete) list of recent changes
- You now get the same experience regardless of your level.
- This removed the ool grouping penalty.
- When grouped, xp is split accordingly based on your levels.
- When typing `kgroup`` the exp shown is the exp gained for members while in that group.
- Practices as we once knew them are gone, you practice skills now by trading in exp.
- There is now an experience penalty for having charmies in your group (even pets).
- When you pk others more than 10 levels below you, you lose 1 level.  Its just that simple.
- When you die from a mob you lose 1/2 your exp.  When you die from a pk, you lose 1/4.
- Only skills that are used automatically increase % by usage.  All spamable skills do not.
- A few more mobs may now be aggressive to you (whether you're level 90 and clanned or not).
- Fleeing causes you to lose experience based on what you would gain from the mob if you killed it.
- Drinks such as Ale no longer have any food value.  So remember to eat a little when you get drunk.
- Your stats are now modifiable (via equipment and spells) less than they were previously.
- You can now steal some of your opponents experience when you pk, if you are holding a rune
``     when you kill them.  Assassins, due to their nature, get experience from pk even without a rune.
- Int helps lower practice costs.
- The alignment system (alignment change via killing) has been completely rewritten by Minax.
- Items that are OOL for you no longer go *POOF* when you quit.
- Cha now plays a greater role in determining if someone you can't push attacks you or not.
- Having a high cha now can reduce the chances that aggressive mobs will chose to attack you.
- In order of alignment gaining, the Bless flag on objects now works like Vampiric's opposite.
- The often request autobutcher capability is now in.
- Characters now only have 2 hands.  Meaning a shield, a held item, and a weapon take one hand each.
- Paladin's leadership skill is now much improved.
- Entangle messages when entangling a mob have been fixed.
- Sidhe no longer speak when using report.
- Runes can be cashed in now at their usual location for 1, 2, or 3 million experience.
- Some of the levels classes get certain skills/spells/prayers/etc at have changed.
- Mana usage for several spells/prayers have changed.
- Lightning breath now costs more mana, but has reduced lag.
- If your class has the hand-to-hand skill, you can now chose that as your primary weapon at creation.
- Reavers can now use their sword command when resting or sleeping.
- Many help files have been updated (and more on the way).
and numerous cosmetic changes have also occurred.

Subject Grouping is now "mo betta"~
Text
I have some new changes in an attempt to further delay the rebellion.
The amount of xp gained while grouping has changed significantly (remember though,
we are still testing.)  It goes a little something like this.
For each member in your group at your same level, you will lose 10% of the normal
amount of experience given by the mob, with a minimum xp gain of 50% of the xp the
mob is worth.  This is scaled of course to deal with group members at different levels,
though the minimum is always 50%.
For example, say there is a mob that gives 10000 xp.  If 2 level 45's kill it, they
each gain 9000.  If 3 level 45's kill it, they each gain 8000.  If 200 level 45's kill
it, they each gain 5000.
EXCEPT that the maximum xp gain from a mob is now 10% of the experience cost for your
next level.  Thus powerleveling is thus reduced somewhat.
Each group can have 1 mov in their group with no penalty.  (IE one pet or one charmie
or 1 whatever).  Each one after that, that is the same level as you, will deduct 20%
of the normal xp gained from that mob, with the minimum gain being 20%.  The mob, or
what we like to call the charmie penalty is subtracted AFTER the normal grouping
xp gain is calculated.  For whiners, not that we let the highest level mob/npc in the
group be the free one.
For example, if you're in a 10 person group, all level 45, and you also have 2 mobs 
in your group that are level 45, you will be getting only 30% of the xp the mob is 
worth.  And again the loss is scaled on the level of the npc in your group versus
your level.
If you're an assassin or holding a rune during pk, you now get 1/2 what the other
person loses, subject to the same group xp loss etc as normal kills.
Oh and if you find a bug and can replicate it, you'll be rewarded.  Ask Longolia.

Ok list of changes in now
- stun should be fixed now
- redirect is fixed so you can't redirect a mob you're already directed at
- Wimpy works right now (so sorry about that one)
- New colors are in for who and score
- Several other bug fixes, involving reavers etc.
- The level difference to wear equipment is now 10 instead of 20.
``  IE You must be 90 to wear a level 100 item now.  Iverath is changing
``  a lot of the old equipment to be able to be worn around the same level,
``  so give us a little time before you revolt.
- And the big change is the new multiclass system.
``
Now let me try to explain the new system.
You can have up to 3 classes.  When you gain levels and go from 30-31, or
60-61, you will be presented with a new class change dialogue.  You will
have the same choices for your new class as you would at creation, except
that you can't be both paladin/reaver, and you can't change into Reaver (
IE to be a Reaver you must START as a Reaver).  You may stay the same
class if you wish.  You gain skills/spells/chants/songs/prayers as follows
For your next 30 levels, if you stay the same class, you get skills 
for your class at levels 31-60 as normal.  If you change classes, you
will get the skills that class normal gets from level 1-30, but for you
they will be level 31-60.  For example if you are a mage and at 31 you
have your next class as warrior, at level 31 you get bash, and it will be
a level 31 skill for you. (assuming warriors get bash at level 1).
The same type of thing occurs when you are able to chose a new class
when gaining to level 61.  If you do, for example mag/war/mag, from levels
61-90 you will gain the skills a mage normally gets from 31-60.  The rest
works like when selecting a new class at level 31.  Thus the best skills
(like eviscerate and exorcism) will only be able to be gotten by pure
classes, IE chars with all 3 classes the same.
A note now on class only equipment.  If a thief only item is level 40 or
less, then a person with at least one class as thief will be able to wear
it.  If an item that is thief only is say, level 50, then only a character
with at least 2 of their three classes as thief will be able to wear it.
And pure classes will be able to wear equipment level 70-100.
This works also for items that are say ranger and warrior only.  If a 
ran/war only item was say level 60, then a ran/war/mag could wear it, since
that char has 2 of the classes required.
Assassinate also had to be fixed.  You get 1/3 of assassinate's strenght
for each of your 3 classes that is thief/assassin.  For example a thi/ass/mag
can assassinate but the power will only be 2/3's the normal assassinate power.
It will take a combination of pure thief/assassin, like thi/ass/ass to get
the full power of assassinate.
Also, level gains (hp,mana,move) are based on your current class (IE the
class you most recently chose).  The difficulty of training skills though
is based on the INITIAL class you pick, as is your "prime stat" (prime stat
being the stat you can train a little higher than the others).  Thus
your primary (or first class) is still a little more important than you're
2nd and 3rd class choices.
There are bound to be some bugs (we tried to nail most, or at least the big
ones), so if you find any tell/note the imms and you shall be rewarded.
This is my one-month anniversary of being a coder present to the mud.

Subject More info on my previous change~
Text
Ok, as the previous change stated I have added player ownership of items, nosave items and
sinking rooms.  The syntax and usage of these is as follows:

Player Owned Items:  Items can not be flagged as owned by a specific player, allowing only they
to wear/hold it.  They can be carried in the inventory of any player though, so looting is
still possible.  I would reccomend that this flag be used very rarely.
Usage:  in edit object type "owner <player name>" or use set obj <obj name> owner <player>

Nosave Objects: These objects fall to the ground in the room a player quits in, not allowing
them to retain possession.
Usage: in edit object tpye "nosave"

Sinking rooms:  Ok this one is a little more involved than the others.  You can now set a room to
be sinking, set the time (in seconds) it takes to sink, set a warning message (ie "Your feet seem
to be being sucked from beneath you").  And also the final sink message.
Usage:  to set a room to be sinking simply go into room edit and type "sinking"
to set the vnum in which the character should sink type "sinkvnum <room vnum>" the code will not
allow you to set it to a vnu that doesnt exist.  To set the time it takes between a player
entering a room and them sinking type "sinktimer <# of seconds>".  To set a warning message (optional)
type "sinkwarning <message>".  This will be shown to the character after half of the time has expired.
Finally, set the sink message "sinkmsg <message>".  As always colors work in these.

Note: mobs also sink too, be careful not too lose all of an areas mobs to a sinking room
in the next update I will add a NO_SINK flag to mobs.

Note 2:  In order to make these changes I had to add more room and mob act slots, so if
you have any ideas for more note me (30 more of each available now).

That's all!  Enjoy!

Hi Guys,
Well we have actually got a stable mud for real this time thanks to some mighty fine handy
work by Iblis!  We have also made some other minor changes that are as follows:

1. Invisibility/Heavenly Cloak - we have made these a little bit better, play around with them and
you will notice how in know time.

2. Race/Class/Clan restrictions on objects will now show up in lore/ident/revelation/auction stats.

Iblis changed the following:

3. Repop Rates - these have been tweaked again and should be more reasonable in many areas.

4. Dive - lag was added to the monk skill dive to make it not so overpowering.

Thats all for now, more cool stuff on the way! =)

edit the desired mob

set the exit direction with 'blockexit <direction/none>'

``    Nopk avatars cannot clan.  Pk avatars are not FORCED to

``      chooses to be an Assassin, they are automatically set
``      as a pk-style avatar.
``    Pre-existing avatars are all now nopk style Avatars
``    You can change between pk/nopk by reincarnating.  Pre-
``      existing avatars get one reincarnate for free to
``      attempt to compensate.  If your pre-existing avatar
``      is already clanned, you will be dealt with on a case
``      by case basis (there is only one I can think of).
- Kills during BR are no longer counted as clanwar kills
- A new points/rewards system will be announced shortly.
``    You can now be given points by immortals for helping
``    newbies, rping, or doing quests.  Quest points will
``    be replacing qtokens for the qtoken scale, though
``    qtokens will of course still be honored.  Rp/Newbie
``    helper points will have their own rewards scale, most
``    likely consisting of experience, restrings, etc rewards
``    (but not equipment).  The bonus of points is that you
``    don't have to worry about storing your tokens somewhere.
``    The downside is you actually have to get the points, you
``    can't buy them from others.
- A new remort race is in, and being tested (Ja'dor), but you
``    cannot yet remort into it.  You will only be able to remort
``    at 90, and you will stay the same classes you are.  More info

- Imms can now be attacked and can attack (but not stolen from) [set on request]
- A new command, nogate, is in.  It is useful mainly for quests.  Type nogate
``    to see its current status (on/off), type nogate X where X is anything,
``    to toggle nogate on or off.  When nogate is on, no one will be allowed to use gate/

``    and after the 8 minutes are up.  This should eliminate the need for immortal intervention
``    in dealing with multikilling.
- The new channels are toggable via the commands `karena`` and `kpk``.  The messages dealing

``    They also can restring items in their inventory, but the item gets the

Subject New hitroll/ac system~
Text
Ok here's a brief explanation about the new hitroll/ac system.  It was implemented so that
hitroll and AC actually make a noticable difference now.  To do that, we had to have sort
of a sucky baseline, so that change could be noticable (IE if you never miss at 0 hitroll
and a -400ac enemy, having 50 hitroll won't make a difference).
So here's a simple explanation.  On average, the plan was for one to hit about 60% of the time.
If you have better hitroll, the chance of hitting will increase, and if your target has better ac
your chance of hitting will decrease.  The idea is if you have about as good hitroll as your target
has ac, you should still hit the average (60%).  Hitroll and ac affect chance separately though.
So even if your victim has perfect ac, (so that the ac factoring into your chance of hitting is 1%)
your hitroll factors into your chance of hitting separately, so that if you have perfect hitroll in
that case, you'll still hit 51% (50% chance from hitroll, 1% chance from ac).  This way someone cannot
be completely unable to be hit with perfect ac, and someone will not always hit perfectly with perfect
hitroll.  But, unlike the old system, ac/hitroll finally affect your chance of hitting enough that it
is noticable.
Due to this, you will notice several hitroll/ac spells/prayers/etc modified to better fit the new system.
Mobs have been modified too.
Obviously, this is a big change, so we will be needing feedback on how things are working out.
We spent time testing things, with player input, but of course the "real world" test begins now.

Hi people

I am not the most active person lately, i know this.. however i have been looking
at exploration tracking... and made a "little" change to it....

Added an imm toggle that defaults to false, so that the game is as it has always been
and made it so - when toggled - "areas" only show the areas you have visited, gate, nexus and portal
wont work for rooms you haven't visited.

This was not entirely the purpose of the tracking system i had in mind, but it sort of
shows the idea... Like i said, it defaults to false, like badsummon, so it is
in reality inactive, but if you think it is worth while, do consider adding/changing it
to your liking.

Text
You can now superduel with up to 4 teams.  To begin a team superduel, 
type `ksuperduel green/red/yellow/blue``, depending on the team you want to be on
You join the same one.  Once the first person has chosen to join a team, everyone
joining must also choose a team.  Likewise, you cannot choose a team
if the initial superdueler did not.  
Same rules as normal superduel, except if only your team is left standing you all win and are transfered
out.  You also have a new kc item for team superduels.
In addition, the messages displayed when someone is removed from a super duel
now depend on the hp of the killer, so you can tell relatively how well they did
by the message that is displayed.

Subject `dA Newbie Clan``~
Text
On the initiative of Spaz, a new kind of clan has been created.
For a while Spaz has built the clan hall, and outlined the clan EQ
that will be available to all lowbies if they join up.
The clan is called "Guttersnipes" and is available to anyone
thats higher than level 9 or lower than level 46.

When a clan member gains his/her/its 46th level, they get kicked
out of the clan to join one of the other, "grownup clans".

Why would a lowbie want to join this clan you ask?
It is a good place to learn how to PK, lots of practically free
clan EQ, and the bonus of being able to PK in Thesden without
getting a wanted flag.

To become a member, one has to do a simple quest for the
florist's daughter.

Be the first to become a member of clan Guttersnipes!

Thanks to Spaz who has been put down lots of time
and effort to make this permanent clan reality.

Subject Approval System~
Text
Hello Folks.
`iNOTICE: Please read the change in it's entirety before commenting. `h
Well this is a change that everyone is going to notice and feel the impact of.
The immortal staff has held many meetings in the past week. We are trying hard
to get Exodus thriving again. We have discussed the features and disadvantages 
of our game,  and have all come to the conclusion that Role Playing is in need 
of some serious help. In my exploring of other muds, I have noticed that those
with a strict and secure Role Playing basis are the ones that seem to be doing
the best as far as Player base is concerned. 

So the imm-staff, as a whole has pledged to take the time to make Exodus have a
deeper, more enriched role playing basis for you all. The first step to this is
something I have come up with and am implementing with all the staffs blessings.
It's called an 'approval system'. 

`jHow it works:`h  

When you make a new character, you can not use the OOC channel or level past 30
until you have been approved by an immortal. Approving basis itself around your
name and description. We will be looking for unique and creative names, as well
as well thought out character descriptions. However,  if you do not wish to put
a lot of time or effort into either,  you don't have to.  (However please refer 
to  help names  to make sure your name is acceptable)  We will approve mediocre 
character descriptions as well,  as long as they are not vulgar or crude in any
way. If you do choose to put the time and effort into your character's name and
description  - Great!  The better your description and names are by the time it 
comes for one of us to approve you - the better you will be rewarded. The prize
you get for your description will depend on whether or not it is well formatted, 
has proper grammar, and shows creativity. A description  -mediocre or not- will
always get  you some type of reward,  although probably not a good one if it is 
painfully obvious that no effort was put in.  The prizes  we will give you will 
range from gold, quest tokens, RP points, restring tokens, and for the cream of
the crop descriptions - a player room. 

Current players over level 30 will  not be forced into unapproval.  However, we 
still encourage you to write a description, and you will still reap the rewards
that we have promised. If you do wish to participate, please notify an immortal
once your description has been written, or put 'Needs Approval' in your title.

This is one small step towards better RP for Exodus and a better player base.We 
hope you will participate kindly. And concerns or gripes about this change that
you may have can be sent in a note to immortals. 

Thank you
- Avariel

Text
A bug that was allowing Reavers to have more attacks than intended with
ShadowSlash has been fixed.  Reavers will now only see 1 attack normally
and 2 attacks when hasted.

We have evaluated the Mana Gains and Total Mana for the average Reaver.
The mana costs for Reavers to power-up their swords were outrageously
inflated.
After reviewing the average mana of a Reaver at each level they gain
specific blade and burst spells, we have drastically adjusted mana
down.
All Reavers should find that they are now about to cast a spells 
at least twice at the level they gain said spell at.

Subject Final Reaver Update (And Lich Despoil)~
Text
We have changed the Reaver's Aura of Evil spell to increase slightly in power
as you level up.  This bonus should only apply to levels in Reaver tiers.  A full
Reaver at level 90 should now get -6 save with Aura of Evil instead of just -1.

This should be our final adjustment to Reavers.  

We are looking at other spells and skills in the game that might not be scaling
so well with levels.  Since the Lich's Despoil spell is the same thing as Aura of
Evil, and more importantly does not stack, we've made the adjustment to that spell

While we felt Reavers needed some more significant tweaking, we are also
reviewing other classes that be weak or uninteresting in some areas.  Particularly
in cases where classes have been nerfed extensively without gaining anything in 
return to at least keep the game-play diverse and engaging.  

For example, we're looking at giving Warriors another skill to two to use in combat
that might add a few more interesting aspects to the class without shifting the 
balance of power too much.
A skill we're considering for warriors is "Crippling Shout"
Crippling Shout would allow the warrior to spend a large portion of his movement
points (35-50%) in order to debuff all enemies in the room engaged in combat with
an affect that causes them to expend a significantly large amount of movement points
to move for a few rounds.
This is just one idea on the able and we would certainly welcome any input or ideas
from everyone on classes that may need some fixing, or just a bit more 'kick' to them!

I have adjusted the HP/Mana/Move regen rates on tick.

If you are Standing you should see a slight improvement.

If you are resting you will get about as much as you used to when 
sleeping.

If you are sleeping you will gain a bit more then you used to.


An additionally bonus is added if you've been out of combat for about 
5 ticks (Its not tick-based like blag is, which is 3 ticks, but the
Bank and Arena "blag" is 120 combat rounds, which should match 3
ticks roughly.  The 'Unblagged' regen bonus is 200 combat rounds)

You will only have to wait 6 ticks instead of 10 after using QUEST CLEAR and 4 
ticks instead of 10 after a successful QUEST COMPLETE.

You should get about 3 times more gold per quest than you used to.  (This is not
exact, the game used to roll 1d(YOUR LEVEL VALUE) * QUEST TYPE to determine gold,
it now rolls 3 dice)

Instead of having a 5/10/15 percent chance of getting a quest point, you now have 
a 8/16/24 percent chance.  We'll see how this works.

Litans can now preform emotes. I assume they were originally denied
this ability because people use emotes to get around the whole, no

can't 'do' something. Emotes are meant to be used for... actions.

So you guys have your emotes back now, and that should make life as
an RP litan a little easier. But if you use this to act as a work-
around for talking, I can and will revoke your emoting privleges.

Examples:
Yes: emote tugs on your sleeve and points west.
No: emote writes, "Hehehe." in the dirt.

Henceforth you may spend qTokens for homes and home items but only in the following manner.

This will not get you 10,000 CREDIT to spend as you please, but if you want 5 points of
furniture regen, or 4 fountains in 4 different rooms, etc, then sure.  
If you want 3 additional rooms, you can pay the remainder after 10,000 is deducted in cash.

So, again, you do not get CREDIT to spend as you please, and you don't get change back
but you can spend 1 qToken per an item or set of identical items (obviously if they're
descriptive items you can have more then 1 description).
