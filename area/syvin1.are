Elvo, the bank president, was not always doing this job.  His previous
profession involved a lot of stealth and dexterity.  Some time ago, he
discovered a much easier way to procure what he wanted.  Thus he founded the
only bank in Linden.  Looking at him, you can tell he still remembers his
old tricks of sorts, judging by the quickness of his hands and movement. 
Perhaps he will be willing to teach you a thing or two.

occasional fish.

`jA toad with brilliant `owhite `jand`k yellow`j wings preens in the sun.``
~
This colorful little toad sits here, seemingly oblivious to the fact that
toads should not be winged nor should should they reach 4 feet in height. 
The twinkle in his eyes and his glowing warts clearly signals that he is,
perhaps, more aware of things that you would think...  And perhaps more than
you.

`aA grey-robed druid with a white-striped robe murmurs his devotions.``
~
Intent on his devotions, or ignoring all outside stimuli, this druid
whispers continually under his breath.  His robe is a simple grey
throughout, save for the broad band of white that rims the hood that shadows
his face.  The scent of herbs, fresh dirt, and incense is quite strong
around him, as he performs duties both spiritual and physical in selfless
devotion to Nature.

`dThe `jCouncil `dTree``~
Encircling the entire tree is an immense platform that provides plenty of 
room for at least a dozen people to sit comfortably.  Carved into the tree are
various scenes depicting nature in its purest form, from a deer grazing by
a waterfall to a Syvin priest meditating on a huge granite boulder.  Looking
out at the expanse of trees all around, there appears to be numerous huts
scattered throughout, all interconnected by a confusing network of rope
bridges.  A huge rope of vines has been attached to the platform leading
down, while bridges lead in the four cardinal directions.

`fMarveling at the variety of instruments lying about would leave any
bard in a state of fascination.  The small confines of the hut lends to the
illusion of a great number of instruments - after careful observation,
you note that it was arranged purposefully to give that impression.  
The worn appearance of the structure itself signifies many years of use.  
`kAmiel`f, the shopkeeper, must have a very successful business, to have 
gathered so many fine instruments.  Quite a few of the valuable objects 
lying about are in various stages of disrepair.  South through the opening

thatched roof bearing a sign reading, '`bGemma's Crafts`d'.  The pugnent
smell of stabled animals sifts into the room from a large hut from the west
with a sign that reads '`bReflia's Mounts`d'.  The bridge continues south and
east of here.

accommodate only one or two people.  Peering intently through the leaves of

bridge rises to the east and falls to the west.  ``

Peaceful Serenity~
`jThis small open structure is similar to a gazebo, with no walls to
speak of, just posts at the corners.  Wooden benches line the edges of the
small landing built high in the trees.  Stopping to rest for a moment and
gaze at the surrounding environment reaveals a mass of wonder.  The tall
thick trunks of the trees tower up from below, with thick branches that
extend a good distance away from the center.  Bridges all around twist,
turn, and vanish then reappear heading in a different directions.  
North leads to a long bridge that connects to a small platform built into 
one of the trees ahead.  East and west both lead onto similar bridges.  ``

A Small Bridge~
`dThis small bridge connects a small gazebo type structure to the west
and a small platform to the east.  Looking east a rather large wooden
structure has been built in the tree, much larger than the typical huts
encountered so far.  The open structure to the west seems to be just a
resting place, while glancing north and south gives a clear view of the
surrounding web of bridges and huts the signify the uniqueness and
simplicity of this village.  ``

`iAn Intersection``~
`gTaking a moment to rest and sort out the confusion of the vast
multitude of bridges, the sudden flutter of a bird lifting into flight from
one of the near branches sends your heart racing.  A large structure
above provides shelter from any drizzle that might seep through the canopy
during a rainstorm.  Examining the roof closer reveals a small door close to
the edge against a large tree, upon which a rather crude set of steps has
been attached.  They are closer to a few boards nailed to a tree rather 
than any set of formal stairs.  Next to the steps, engraved into the tree, 
a sign reads `d'Owl's Landing'`g.  South, east and west all lead to more 
bridges, while further exploration of the small door up could prove 
worthwhile.  ``

`dSpanning the distance between the huts just east and west of here, this
particular bridge doesn't seem much different than all the rest.  Very
worn and ragged, it is perilously close to rotting away.  Scanning through 
the trees, you see numerous other bridges in the distance weave in and out 
in all directions.``

to the east, the `cforest `gdisappears into the horizon.  Movement from the
ground below catches your eye as a startled deer bolts through the forest,
running from some unseen danger.  Looking west, the web of bridges span
between the trees at varying heights, all connecting small rudimentary huts
that are nestled in the trees.``

A Tree Hollow~
The damp smell of rotting treetrunk assaults your olfactory senses as you
descend into this wet, hollow pit.  Small wormwood handles allow you to
clamber back up out of the hole to the tree platform above.  In the center
of the chamber, a very small hole leads even further into this tree.  Faint
fumes curl out of the hole, evaporating as soon as they come into contact with
the open air.

`lThe variety of goods offered here is astounding.  The wooden floor of
this small shop has been swept clean and provides an amiable atmosphere in
which to browse.  A small counter stands against the far wall, and a small
window on the north wall provides a clear view into the forest.  Small hand
carved containers line the south wall, while an odd assortment of weapons
used for hunting are piled in the corner.``

`dThe gentle rise of this bridge leads to a small platform in the
distance.  Moving past overhanging limbs, green with leaves, the bridge
sways and rocks from the shifting weight.  The dull moan of straining fibers
chills to the bone.  The prudent thing to do might be to quicken your pace to
get to the small hut ahead.  The bridge continues dangerously to the north
and south.  ``

as bridges sway from the gentle breeze and huts dot the landscape, nestled
in trees.

`nA Small Landing``~
`gFinally able to plant your foot on something solid, you take a moment
to rest and gaze around.  A wooden rail on the north edge provides a safe
place to lean and view the immense forest in the distance.  Upon further
inspection, there is a long rope leading down to the ground, and the rope
bridges are strung between trees to the south and west.  The view from here
is endless forest, trees upon trees disappear into the distance.  Birds soar
in the sky above and the graceful flight of an eagle, unlike all others,
captivates the eye.  ``

`dThe view from this height is nothing short of breathtaking, rendering
an awe-inspiring panorama of the forest that continues to the north. 
The bustling of activity can be heard all around as the humid air clings to
every thing tangible.  The durability of the bridge leaves much to be
desired, having seen better days in years past.  To the west is a small,
quaint looking hut fashioned from wood and bound by vines.

`jThis hut is rather bland in comparison to some, its dusty floors and bare
walls divulge nothing in the way of its purpose.  The expansive windows on
the north and east walls are the only clues as to the real function of this
well placed hut.  Glimpsing out of each window, a huge forest disappears onto
the horizon.  A cool, relaxing breeze drifts in through the windows, and the
fresh smell of sap fills the air.  Both exits, south and west, lead to
bridges.``

allowing further movement.  The leaves in the trees rustle as a gentle
breeze brushes past them.  The ground can be seen far below, and the smell
of dripping sap wafts through the air.  Stopping to take a glance around,
you can see bridges everywhere.  The movement of tall slender figures dart in
and about the small huts in the distance on all sides.  Just west of here is
a large platform built around a huge giant oak tree, and to the east is
wooden landing, next to a small hut.  ``

``The small wooden landing doesn't look much safer than the other
bridges, aside from the fact that it is made of solid wood.  Still, it is
very small and doesn't allow much room for maneuvering.  A small wooden hut
is just north of here with a sign on the exterior which reads, `o'The Wooden
Flute'``.  Sounds of animals echo from a pet store above.  The bridge
continues east, west, and south of here along some unstable ground.

`jA Small Landing``~
`cThis landing is fairly small in comparison to the large platform just
to the east.  Four different bridges converge on this landing, all from
different directions.  A few tree branches that have not been trimmed
hang low, obstructing some of the view.  The floor of the forest is a
good distance down, and the canopy above is very close.  Directly above
there appears to be a roof, but careful observation would lead you to the 
wooden boards nailed to the side of a tree, forming a set of steps up.  
A roughly made wooden bench rests at the edge of the platform for travelers 
to rest.  Upwards leads to a small door and bridges provide passage in all 
other directions.  ``

A Long Bridge~
`d This long bridge stretches out in a north and south direction.  The
delicious aroma of different foods being prepared drifts from the east. 
Glancing west, a crude little hut made of wood is nestled close to the trunk
of a tree.  The bridge continues in the distance to the north, while south
leads back to another intersection.  ``

`cThe enticing aroma from inside this shop is almost overwhelming,
sending your head spinning.  Straw baskets line the floor on both sides,
each containing a different flavor of nourishment.  The quaint interior only
accents the wonderful fare that is served here.  Delicious smelling stew
drifts in from a back room, and the plump fruits that have been arranged
perfectly on a small table makes your mouth water.  A plump little old man
stands behind a counter against the far wall.  The door on the west wall
leads back out to the bridge.  ``

the room.  From the simple appearance, you can tell that whomever lives here 
is very in touch with nature.  The natural scenes depicted on the tanned 
leather skins that adorn the walls lead to the conclusion that the owner 
spends more time in the forest than in this hut.  East leads through a door

`gFinally able to plant your feet on something solid, you take a moment
to rest and gaze around.  A wooden rail on the north edge provides a safe
place to lean and view the immense forest in the distance.  Upon further
inspection, there is a long rope leading down to the ground, and the rope
bridges are strung between trees to the south and west.  The view from here
is endless forest - trees upon trees disappear into the distance.  Birds soar
in the sky above and the graceful flight of a falcon, unlike all others 
you've ever seen, captivates the eye.  ``

below.  To the northeast, an exceptionally large tree rises in the middle of
the village.  The disturbance of vegetation below catches your eye as a
large animal penetrates the thickets in search of food.  A short distance to
the south, across a long bridge, a small hut can be seen.  A rope bridge
leads east to the base of a set of stairs carved into a tree.  A door
leading to a quaint wooden hut is set to the west, while the long bridge

A cool breeze blows by as you stand in the middle of the gently swaying
rope bridge built high into the tree tops of Linden, chilling you slightly
as you stare at the wonderous bridges and vines placed all over the tiny
village.  Wooden huts have been carved from the bases of some trees, while
others are delicately placed within the arms of the thick branches extending
from the trunks.  Syvin villagers scurry around as they continue their daily
chores, politely smiling at you as they pass by.  North leads back to the

is rivaled only by the noxious fumes sifting through the walls.  A hole is
carved into the floor of the small room, filled with beads, trinkets, and

east wall of this room, leading to an unknown destination.

`nA Small Platform``~
`gFinally able to plant your foot on something solid, you take a moment
to rest and gaze around.  A wooden rail on the south edge provides a safe
place to lean and view the immense forest in the distance.  Upon further
inspection, there is a long rope leading down to the ground, and the rope
bridges are strung between trees to the north and east.  The view from here
is endless forest, trees upon trees disappear into the distance.  Birds soar
in the sky above and the graceful flight of a falcon unlike all others
captivates the eye.``

A tree branch~
You stand suspended over the sprawl of the massive Silver Crescent woods,
held above the grass and lesser trees only by the support of a weak tree branch.
A bird's nest lies in the far corner, filled with interesting bits and pieces of
items stolen from the residents of this area.

`dThe gentle rise of this bridge leads to a small platform in the
distance.  Moving past overhanging limbs, green with leaves, the bridge
sways and rocks from the shifting weight.  The dull moan of straining fibers
chills to the bone.  The prudent thing to do might be to quicken the pace to
get to the small hut ahead.  The bridge continues dangerously to the north

leaves a sense of respect at the very nature of this village.  Crude as it
may be it's still very functional with some sense of planning having gone
into it's design, as confusing as it may seem at first glance.  To the west
is a small hut fashioned from wood and the bridge continues to the north and

walls divulge nothing in the way of it's purpose.  The expansive windows on
the south and west walls are the only clues as to the real function of this
well placed hut.  Glimpsing out of each window, a huge forest dissappears on

fresh smell of sap fills the sir.  Both exits, north and east, lead to

`dInside The Inn``~
`kThe room is much larger in appearance than at first glance.  Peering out
one of the windows provides an extremely beautiful view.  A maze of bridges
twist and turn around trees connecting different small little huts, all at 
varying heights.  A few tables have been spaced evenly around the room, and 
there are doors on the west and north walls.``

The Kitchen~
This small back room in the inn is rather messy, with rough wooden
bowls scattered about.  The delicious aroma of stew floats in the air.  Over
to the side a small fire burns in a rock pit with a crude ceramic pot
resting over the flames.  A set of shoddy wood shelves against the west wall
holds various spices and dry goods, collected from the forest.  The door in
the south wall leads back to the main part of the Inn.

world, the only one of it's kind in the village.  A small granite hearth has
a warm fire glowing, creating flickering shadows on the walls.  Neatly
folded in the corner are a few animal furs to provide warmth against the
chill of the night air.

blankets are piled in the corner, and a the faint smell of smoke, from a
fire long extinguished, lingers in the air.  A small window in the east wall
accomodates a nice view of the immediate surroundings outside.  A small door
in the floor of the hut leads back down.  ``

A Simple Shrine~
A simple shrine made from branches and twigs have been built here in the
glory of the greater gods for all to come and pay homage to.  Placed on top
of a stone slab, it sits above the level of the platform with a glorific
glow radiating from the candles burning behind it.  East least back to the
entrance of the temple.

A Simple Shrine~
A stone slab has been placed in the middle of the platform, upon which a
wooden shrine has been built in the honor of the gods.  Candles placed
behintd it cast light radiating from the surface of the altar, casting
translucent shadows in the corners of the small room.  A soft scent of
incense wafts its way towards you, seemingly leading you back west to the
entrance of the simple temple.

between the entrance to the main altar to the north.  A pleasent smell of
burned fragrances wafts in from the north, its smoke slightly stinging your
eyes as it passes through the room out into the open air.  Soft chanting
echoes from the north, composed of a mix of languages you cannot comprehend
or distinguish.  Fresh air seems to drift in from the south.

Within the Halls of the Temple~
`cYou stand in the center of the wooden structure raised as the temple of
Linden, a simply adorned building designed in all modesty to the gods. 
Here, corridors diverge and lead to different parts of the temple where
different activities take place.  To the north, a very elaborate shrine has
been erected for you to pay homage to your gods.  West and east seem to lead
to special rooms designed for those who have pledged the lives completely to
their faith.  South leads back to the entrance of the temple.

A Treetop Shrine in Linden~
A light breeze whisps gently through the leaves and branches of the tree
surrounding you, gently brushing your face, refreshing you.  Numerous
scattered candles burn endlessly, providing this treetop shrine with an
unending supply of light.  The flames of the candle neither flicker nor
waver in the breeze, nor do they show any sign of ever burning out.  The
platform extends eastward, toward what appears to be a cluttered supply
room.  A ladder reaches down to the another platform below, through a hatch
in the ground.  You feel relaxed here atop the trees with the wind blowing
gently through your hair and the sounds of the peaceful village below
filling your ears.

`cThe simple detail of the abode has an elegent yet modest air about the
room with a intricate shrine built against the west wall under a small open
window.  A cool breeze blows in from the east and escapes west, wafting with
it wisps of smoke of incense.  Mats placed against the north side of the
temple offer you a place to sit and rest.  The center of the temple is a
short distance to the east, while another larger altar room is just south of
here.

for the convenience of other paladins to use and perform their daily
rituals.  Against the northern wall is a mat for one to sit and relax, and
to share the stories of heroic deeds.  A soft breeze blows in from the
window and leads west through the main temple, slighltly chilling you
through your armor.  Looking south, you see a tall man dressed in a simple
brown tunic standing before yet another shrine.

An Elaborate Shrine~
Burning candles of white wax have been placed in a semi-circular fashion
around an obsidian stone altar raised on a platform in the center of the
room.  The smoke, mixed with that from the incense burning in the room,
gently sifts to and fro before swirling gently south through the open
portal.  The base of the flawless altar is made from a grey granite stone
fashioned in the shape of a oval.  The walls of the room are adorned with
leaves from the trees of the forest below, disguising the chamber as a
natural forest enclosure.  A feeling of divine power radiates from the
obsidian stone, reminding of your humility.  The only exit from here is the
portal leading south back into the center of the temple.

obviously been put here for people who have had a difficult time in Linden.

the altar are several candles burning with a soft glow, their smoke mixing
with odors of the incense in the room.  Windows are placed on all three
walls in the room, allowing cool breezes to blow through.  A short corridor
to the north leads back to the abode.

small shrine is placed against the western wall for the master ranger to
perform his daily communion.  An open window on the east and south allow light
to enter the room, illuminating the chamber without the need of artificial
light.  To the north is the public shrine for all other rangers to use.

The wonderous sounds of nature echo all around as you stand here at the
edge of a secluded grove.  The majestic trees which support Linden reach far
above you towards the cloudless skies as they swing their branches to the
rhythm of the north wind.  A path has been foraged here, covered by the
shade of the leaves hanging overhead and leading north away from the grove. 
A soft trickle of water can be heard somewhere within the circle of trees to
the east.

next to the steps reads, `d'The Dispatch'`g.  Movement can be heard inside

of all sorts of animals, likely the normal wildlife which wanders through
the area.  Listening carefully, you barely make out the pleasant sounds of a
musical instrument being played somewhere to the distance north.  The path
runs both north and south, while a small forest opens up west of here.

air feels warm here, heated by the constant contact to the incandescent glow
of sun.  Chirps of birds and the soft rustle of animals moving in the forest
echo loudly here, resounding an orchestra of nature.  The ground is covered
with a soft layer of green grass, making this place an ideal picnic spot. 
The dirt path leads away to the west and to the south where a faint trickle
of water can be heard.

hut has been built south of you.

On a Raised Platform~
The large board of wood has been placed on a supporting large branch
extending from the huge tree just south of you.  The chilling breeze passing
through the open leaves blows past you, shivering you to the bone.  The
endless chatter of villagers wandering through Linden echo all around,
floating high into the peaceful blue skies.  A well can be seen to the
north, while more platform extends east and west.  A large set of stairs
have been carved into the southern tree.

Village Traders' Bank~
Inside the hut, a beautiful woman stands ready to help all entrants with
whatever banking needs they might have, be they a Linden merchant, visiting
adventurer, or one of the citizens of the village.  The room is quaintly
adorned, various banking tools in positions of honor, such as a
sturdy-looking chest made of fine wood and a wooden abacus.  The bank's door
leads east back onto the main platform.

Below Another Platform~
`cA large set of stairs has been cut into the trunk of this large tree
supporting the platform you are now standing on.  Each step has been
carefully designed to be of optimal height for anyone to easily climb
without straining one's self.  Looking up, you see another smaller platform
supporting a elaborate, yet plain, hut.  North leads back towards the main
platform square of Linden.

The Elders' Hut~
`iThe elder's hut is daintly decorative, with different articles of the
natural world lying about in no methodical manner.  Composed of a thick
wood, the walls seem to be sturdy enough to stand the most powerful winds
and shelter those within from the worst of downpours.  Westward leads to a
private shrine, while south goes further into the hut.

`c A shrine has been placed against the west wall, below a circular
window carved into the surface of wood.  Over the hole is a curtain composed
of stiched leaves which provide adequate protection against the elements of
nature.  The shrine itself seems to be built of a grey stone rock, laced
with a crystalline type mineral.  East least back to the entrance of the
elders' hut.

hut, next to a small open window for one to ventilate the room with.  The
chamber seems to be devoid of much else, save a wooden dresser of sorts for
the occupants to store clothing and small personal belongings.  East least
back into the hut.

The Elders' Hut~
The interior of the small hut seems much larger than you perceived from
outside.  Likely it is the result of having very few pieces of furniture to
clutter the rooms up.  The wood floor is well defined and polished to make
for easy passage through the home.  North leads to the open entrance of the
hut, while west goes into a more private bedroom.

The Elders' Hut~
`cThe quaint little hut is well plainly decorative with mats and stiched
leaves hanging all over the walls, covering the well polished wooden planks
which make up this small home.  An open door to the north allows chilling
wind to pass through with only a cast away curtain to prevent the elements
of nature from invading this space.  East leads towards a smaller, yet
better defined room.  Going south leads you deeper into the elders' home.

An Elders' Shrine~
`oA beautiful shrine intricately designed from different types of shiny
stones has been placed against the northern wall of the small hut, obviously
used for daily prayers and rituals common in the life of a syvin of Linden. 
The room is well spaced out with a small window in the east wall, letting a
chilly breeze blow through the chamber.  A curtain of stiched leaves is cast
aside from the hole, now useless against the elements of nature.  West leads
back to the entrance of the elders' home.

wooden chest and a well polished dresser against the southern wall.  A
single window has been cut against the east side, allowing a cool breeze to
enter the otherwise warm chamber.  Nothing else seems to adorn this place,
except a few piece of clothing lying on the floor.  A single exit exists to
the west back into the interior of the hut.

The Elders' Hut~
`gHides of different animals hang about the walls of the elders' trophy
room, depicting the history of a well defined warrior and hunter of this
syvin tribe.  The smell of incense wavers in the air and fills your nostrils
with the odor of dried flowers.  The smooth wooden floor extends north and
east of here, the only directions you are able to travel.

Before the Chieftain's Hut~
You stand on the foyer of a well crafted house situated high into the
treetops of the syvin village, overlooking the expanse of Linden.  The
leaves of the tall trees reach out around the hut, obscuring most of the
details of the home of a truly important person.  Guards stand their post
before the open portal leading south inside the building.  A set of stairs
has been made near the northern end of the platform, leading back down to
the next level of the town.

The Chieftain's Hut~
`dThis quaint hut overlooks the village of Linden in all its entirety,
situated high into the trees for the leader of the council to stand and
represent his people.  Within the wooden walls of the structure are few
personal items save for the ceremonial trinkets and staves common for the
tribal leader.  The north door actually is a stiched leaf curtain which
proves to be very effective in protecting from the world's natural elements.
A bedroom is through the western portal, while a shrine is on the eastern
half of the building.

`oA large bedroll made from soft feathers is neatly made in the center of
the room, between two open windows on the north and south walls of the small
room.  Around the room are trinkets and small articles of native culture,
likely used by the chieftain for the rituals he is expected to perform for
the village.  An elaborate rug carefully knitted rests before the east
doorway leading back to the center of the home.

`cA simple shrine has been built against the east wall, between to open
windows which allow a cool breeze to enter through the chamber.  The shrine
sits on an onyx black stone and is composed of a grey stone, smoothly
polished and well maintained.  A small windchime mourns above the altar. 
The floor is covered with a fur rug, likely the trophy of one of the
chieftain's hunting expeditions.  Candles burn on either side of the shrine,
their flames gently dancing to the wind.

The Edge Of The Platform~
You stand on a small extension of the platform, and try to find why this
board of wood has been placed here.  The sturdy plank has been reinforced
with wooden pegs and beams set to withstand a lot of weight, as well as
having a rail to prevent people from accidentally falling off.  Looking over
the edge, you notice a cage suspending in the air, swinging back and forth
to the gentle rockings of the wind.

Inside A Suspended Cage~
`gYou have been confined in a small wooden cage suspended under the
platform above with no way for you to escape.  The villagers below look up
at you and bear witness to the shame and dishonor you have displayed for all
to see.  A hardened criminal, you cannot escape their sneers and glares at
you as they pass by.  The chilling wind shivers you through the thin tunic
you are allowed to wear, and rocks your cage back and forth in the air.

A quaint little office has been placed at the back of the bank.  This is
where the person in charge keeps records of accounts and charges and so
forth.  A small window is set in the wall to the right, allowing slivers of
light to fall across an oak desk in the center of the room.  Stacks of books
and papers litter the floor, obviously in great need of some organization. 
East leads back into the bank's main room.

Perila's Pets~
Within the bounds of this small hut, a cacophony of animal sounds can be
heard in a gentle chorus.  It is as if the peaceful nature of the woman
living here has so calmed animal aggression that a hawk can perch safely
unhooded near a small bunny.

This large hut is filled with different types of tamed animals, some so
strange that you find them very peculiar as mounts.  The room has the stench
of live animals contained in a closed space for too long.  The soft bleating
of a strange beast echoes in from your right, while a high pitched screech
sounds from ahead of you.  A large syvin man stands before you, ready to
help accommodate your needs.

A Small Forest~
A gentle breeze cuts through the trees of this forest, brushing by your
face, rejuvinating you.  All around you, small woodland animals scurry
about, very few of them even acknowledging your presence.  The lush, vibrant
foliage surrounding you fills you with a feeling of calm serenity.

flowing through the peaceful forest.  All about are little animals scurrying
into the cover of the thick foliage of their natural habitat.  Exits lead

Bright rays of sunlight penetrate the cover of the forest's branches
hanging over the floor of the woods.  The golden beams seem to dance along

by you, wisping your hair to and fro.  The forest extends east and south of
here.

The Top of the Tree~
The frigid cool winds whisk by you as you hang tight to the trunk of the
tree.  Looking over the spires of the other trees around you, you notice the
city of Linden a short way off towards the east.  The tree sways gently to
the wind, rocking in a back and forth manner.  The only way out of here is
to climb back down before you lose your grip.

Priestly Pets~
Within the bounds of this small, immaculate chamber in the shrine, a
cacophony of animal sounds can be heard, voices raised in a gentle hymn. 
The peaceful nature of the woman who abides here is the reason why she was
chosen to care for the animal avatars of the gods until they are claimed by
the predestined mortals.  For her work, she takes only donations for the
Church.

A Simple Shrine~
A stone slab has been placed in the middle of the platform, upon which a
wooden shrine has been built in the honor of the gods.  Candles placed
behintd it cast light radiating from the surface of the altar, casting
translucent shadows in the corners of the small room.  A soft scent of
incense wafts its way towards you, seemingly leading you back west to the
entrance of the simple temple.
