harried expression and the constant motion of his hands as he puts food into
stalls, shovels a mountain of fresh dragon-made fertilizer, and shines
scales indicates his efficiency and the size of his taskload.

Entrance to the Castle of Chambers~
You stand in front of a giant oak gate that leads into the Chamber's
Castle.  The gate has been burnt though by the `bFlaming warriors`l who lay
seige to it to raid the castle.  As you inspect the gate, you find the lock
intact and unlocked, unusual and suspicious.  You notice that the northeastern
tower is still afire from the great battle.

cold, and damp.  There are people walking all around and then it dawns on
you that they are the survivors of the battle above.  They must have run down
into the cave when the attack came, the dead above must have bought them time
to escape unnoticed.  To the north are the guard barracks, and the town
continues west and south from here.

The cave has been cleaned and straightened up here a little more. It
looks more like people are actually living here, with fires around giving off
not enough light but plenty warmth.

Hidden Caverns~
The cave here has been lit by torches hung along the cavern walls.  There
are a couple of workers hanging a few more as you look around the cave. 
They seem to be fixing up the cave more and more every day. It is an absolutely
spectacular cave, the minerals reflect the light and sparkle like diamonds. 
To the east you see a door leading into the King's Room, to the south you
hear what you think is a waterfall.

Guard Barracks~
This cave is quite large, housing about 50 beds.  Most of the guards here
are wounded and recovering from the battle above.  A nurse is here tending
to the men, she has a soft glow to her pure and kind soul.  She seems
to glow in the soft light that there is.

This cave is absolutely gorgeous - its walls shimmer in the light
provided by a warm fire in the corner of the room.  The walls are covered in
opal columns that are embedded into the cave walls.  The opal gives off a
spectacular shine and glisten, making you feel that there is still hope left
in these people's hearts.

from the top of the cavern into a deep pool.  You lean down and take a small
sip of the water, its very cold and tastes good.

The lighting in this part of the cave is very adequate, it shows three
new intersections.  To the west you hear sounds of water freezing and
cracking while a cold wind blows from that direction.  To the north you hear
nothing, but the cave gets much darker that direction.  To the east, the cave
is well lit and shows its magnificent beauty.

The cave here splits to the south.  It has been totally reworked,
this part must have been reclaimed by the Chamber people.  They have built
steps leading south to cross a little section of rocks.  The light from
lanterns mounted from the ceiling improves the lighting dramatically.

Welcome to Freeze's shop!  You notice that the room is about 30 degrees
colder than the rest of the cave and wish that you had more clothes on. 
Freeze comes out and you see that he is a giant frost dragon, he freezes the
water in the bucket and it forms a solid block of ice.  You see him start to
chisel out rock hard weapons and armor from the ice and wonder how long they
last.

Money Office~
You have entered the Money Exchanger's office, the office is bare, only
having a desk and a chair for the person to sit and exchange money.  The
walls are bare, no plants, no paintings of family or landscapes.  It makes
you feel very cold, sad, and hate for those who have done this to these
people.

Throne Room~
You have entered the Mighty Throne room of the Chambers.  Its walls are
coated in gold and silver offsetting and glistening the light throughout the
room.  The throne is made of solid titanium and glistens in the light like a
polished diamond.  The Fire Ruler sits upon the throne and beckons for his
guards as you enter.

Servant's Quarters~
The room has been left undisturbed, there is a small bed and a couple of
other things in the closet, as you peer at the bed more closely you realize 
there are two thieves in it having sex!

Lt. Chivalry's Room~
The room has been searched thoroughly - the bed has been overturned, the
paintings ripped off the wall.  Whoever did this was looking for something,
and would do anything to find it.

Spare Bedroom~
You enter one of the spare bedrooms that wasn't even touched in all the ruckus.
All the objects laying here look like they haven't been used in a couple of 
months.  A `kyellow`l dress is still laying here on the bed like someone was 
getting ready to put it on before she went out.

to the north looks immaculate.

In the Shower~
You jump in the shower and turn on the cold water.  Steam rises as your
armor and weapons are cooled off so quickly.  The cool water
slows your body down and you feel much more in focus and relaxed.

This room is filled with smoke, you can't see much but a gray haze.  You
hear a woman moaning somewhere in the room.  She sounds as if she is hurt or
very scared.

Dark Caves~
The cave here is damp, dark, and very unsafe. The roof feels like
it is going to collapse from the great strain that it must be under.  Small
pebbles fall from the ceiling of the cave all over your back as you explore
this part of the cave.

A New Tunnel~
The tunnel here seems rather unstable and very unsafe, pebbles fall all
your head as you walk wander through the cave.  It seems like it is
going to collapse at any second.  The walls are covered in moss and weeds
since the cave is so damp.  You had better head out before you find yourself 
trapped under an avalanche of rocks.

Water slowly drips from the ceiling of the cave to puddle upon the floor.

Stone Stairway~
As you were being sucked along the river, you managed to reach out
and grab onto a stone ledge, which happens to be a stairway that leads up to 
a door.  You don't know who, what, or where you are!  The cave had been 
traversed frequently, as you notice the stairs have just been carved in.

Hidden Cave~
The cave is in shambles and needs severe work.  It is barely
passable, with large boulders strewn all about that you trip over
despite your wariness.

Lt. Chivalry's Cave~
The room is nothing more than a bed, a few drawings strewn about, and
strategic maps discarded on the ground.  This room is obviously used for
nothing more than a place to sleep.

An Unfinished Shop~
The room is a bloody mess, there is a pool of blood on the ground next to
a giant boulder, and you wonder inquisitively what might have happened.  
It looks like a half finished shop, with bits of building materials laying
around.  It wouldn't take much effort to complete it.

The cave here is beginning to look habitated - rocks have been cleared away 
and a trail has been shaped between the granite walls.  The trail heads north 
and south while a step ladder leads up into a higher cave.

The Light Shop~
The light shop is a full time business down here.  The owner is constantly
finding new and longer sources of fuel for his torches.  He has several right
now and is working on inventing an almost infinite light source.
