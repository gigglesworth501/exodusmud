aussel man~
Aussel~
A man clothed in brilliant shades of grey and gold scans out over the peaks.
~
Aussel is a man who has spent his entire life, or close to it, searching for
the secrets of au septieme ciel.  From the broad grin on his face and the
glimmer of understanding in his eye, you are led to wonder whether he just
might have.

Aggran~
A disheveled hermit sits in the shade of an alpine tree, muttering to himself.
~
Aggran, one of the many adventurers to ascend these peaks with hopes of
glory, is now reduced to a wreck of a human being.  No doubt exists in your
mind that he gained new knowledge while here, but it looks as if the detriments
far outweigh any victories he might have encountered.

`oA menacing snowman stalks his prey through the icy peaks.``
~
`oFrostbite the snowman is an evil creation.  A frost elemental conjured up by
the forces of evil to do battle with the Patriarch and his forces, it casts a
cold unfeeling gaze at you as it moves to attack you.  Its legs are unseen
beneath a thick round plate of ice-armor that covers it from the waist down.
Above that is another circular piece of armor that covers the chest.  Thin
wispy arms emerge from either side, ending in branch-like clawed fingers.
Its head is obscured mostly by a round helmet of ice that shields the beast
from view, except for a pair of evil glowing `ired`o eyes.``

S'approcher du paradis~
Perched on the edge of a granite cliff that defies both matter and motion
to defer to its immovable force, you are allowed the rare view of
unbroken sky.  So close is this infinite plane, it thrusts itself upon you
with the impetuousness of air currents, and envelops you with the sudden urge
to leap and float free upon the wind.  Solitude is your involuntary companion,
here where starkness reigns and the motionless world stoops to your unyielding
will.

S'approcher du paradis~
A strange sense of piety instills itself in you as you raise your head
up to battle the battering winds, a defiant act from your person against
the great gods of stone that tower before you.  Off in the distance,
far below the rim of the glacial valley, you can see a profusion of lofty
foothills nestled in the shadow of these magnificent summits.  These verdant 
terraced hills meander out of sight, creating a strange reverse magnetism with
the harsh stone peaks that skyrocket into the clouds far above.

S'approcher du paradis~
Glassy blue ice gathers in the crevices along the mountain face, some of it 
centuries old, the temperature never rising high enough for it to melt.
Jagged mountain peaks and precariously balanced boulders loom high above,
while steep cliffs and desolate slopes descend and provide limited passage
through this desolate range.  Few things manage to live at this high
altitude, some green-brown mosses and a few small spiders are all that survive
among the rocks and ice.

S'approcher du paradis~
High cliffs and peaks rise towards the sky, covered in ice and making a 
jagged line along the horizon.  Only a few determined plants cling desperately
to clumps of dirt wedged in rock fissures and crags in the face.  Footholds 
are scarce along the steep slopes of these mountains, cliffs run along the 
sides, and each footfall knocks loose a few small stones which tumble down, 
falling noiselessly into the valleys between the peaks.  Passage is slow
and tedious, and the high altitude leaves you feeling light headed.

Far above the puerile illogic of the sycophantic sheep that dot the
cities below, there is nothing here to debauch the unbroken planes of granite 
which do not yield, but instead converge with the clouds, forming graceful
curves about the aeonian explosion of stone.  As erect and resolute as 
a clenched fist thrust towards the heavens, it is hard to discern if these
peaks stand in reverence or defiance of the proximate celestial firmament.

Trailing mists of windblown slow form a shardlike mane on the faces of the
massive rock walls that are the closest frontage of the humongous mountains
that tower around you.  Behind the rocky ridges that undulate along the
left banks, towers of nature rise to remarkable heights.  As you stride
through the pass you glance around in awe at the titans of nature, clothed
in armor of rocks and ice.

S'approcher du paradis~
A world of fierce wonder unfolds before you as you trek along the
mountain-ringed glacier basin that extends bowl-like, encompassing the north.
Striking views of gigantic snow-topped summits that pierce the clouds
contrast sharply with the plummeting glaciers that move ever so slowly
in the mountain cirque.  Turbulent gales of wispy snow batter you
consistently as you make your way along, numbing your face and blurring
your vision -- a beauty tempered by savagery.

jagged line along the horizon.  Only a few determined plants cling desperately
to clumps of dirt wedged in rock fissures and crags in the face.  Footholds 
are scarce along the steep slopes of these mountains, cliffs run along the 
sides, and each footfall knocks loose a few small stones which tumble down, 
falling noiselessly into the valleys between the peaks.  Passage is slow
and tedious, and the high altitude leaves you feeling light headed.

Far above the puerile illogic of the sycophantic sheep that dot the
cities below, there is nothing here to debauch the unbroken planes of granite 
which do not yield, but instead converge with the clouds, forming graceful
curves about the aeonian explosion of stone.  As erect and resolute as 
a clenched fist thrust towards the heavens, it is hard to discern if these
peaks stand in reverence or defiance of the proximate celestial firmament.

A world of fierce wonder unfolds before you as you trek along the
mountain-ringed glacier basin that extends bowl-like, encompassing the north.
Striking views of gigantic snow-topped summits that pierce the clouds
contrast sharply with the plummeting glaciers that move ever so slowly
in the mountain cirque.  Turbulent gales of wispy snow batter you
consistently as you make your way along, numbing your face and blurring
your vision -- a beauty tempered by savagery.

Glassy blue ice gathers in the crevices along the mountain face, some of it 
centuries old, the temperature never rising high enough for it to melt.
Jagged mountain peaks and precariously balanced boulders loom high above,
while steep cliffs and desolate slopes descend and provide limited passage
through this desolate range.  Few things manage to live at this high
altitude, some green-brown mosses and a few small spiders are all that survive
among the rocks and ice.

A strange sense of piety instills itself in you as you raise your head
up to battle the battering winds, a defiant act from your person against
the great gods of stone that tower before you.  Off in the distance,
far below the rim of the glacial valley, you can see a profusion of lofty
foothills nestled in the shadow of these magnificent summits.  These verdant 
terraced hills meander out of sight, creating a strange reverse magnetism with
the harsh stone peaks that skyrocket into the clouds far above.

Perched on the edge of a granite cliff that defies both matter and motion
to defer to its immovable force, you are allowed the rare view of
unbroken sky.  So close is this infinite plane, it thrusts itself upon you
with the impetuousness of air currents, and envelops you with the sudden urge
to leap and float free upon the wind.  Solitude is your involuntary companion,
here where starkness reigns and the motionless world stoops to your unyielding
will.

S'approcher du paradis~
Trailing mists of windblown slow form a shardlike mane on the faces of the
massive rock walls that are the closest frontage of the humongous mountains
that tower around you.  Behind the rocky ridges that undulate along the
left banks, towers of nature rise to remarkable heights.  As you stride
through the pass you glance around in awe at the titans of nature, clothed
in armor of rocks and ice.

S'approcher du paradis~
Perched on the edge of a granite cliff that defies both matter and motion
to defer to its immovable force, you are allowed the rare view of
unbroken sky.  So close is this infinite plane, it thrusts itself upon you
with the impetuousness of air currents, and envelops you with the sudden urge
to leap and float free upon the wind.  Solitude is your involuntary companion,
here where starkness reigns and the motionless world stoops to your unyielding
will.

S'approcher du paradis~
A strange sense of piety instills itself in you as you raise your head
up to battle the battering winds, a defiant act from your person against
the great gods of stone that tower before you.  Off in the distance,
far below the rim of the glacial valley, you can see a profusion of lofty
foothills nestled in the shadow of these magnificent summits.  These verdant 
terraced hills meander out of sight, creating a strange reverse magnetism with
the harsh stone peaks that skyrocket into the clouds far above.

Glassy blue ice gathers in the crevices along the mountain face, some of it 
centuries old, the temperature never rising high enough for it to melt.
Jagged mountain peaks and precariously balanced boulders loom high above,
while steep cliffs and desolate slopes descend and provide limited passage
through this desolate range.  Few things manage to live at this high
altitude, some green-brown mosses and a few small spiders are all that survive
among the rocks and ice.

High cliffs and peaks rise towards the sky, covered in ice and making a 
jagged line along the horizon.  Only a few determined plants cling desperately
to clumps of dirt wedged in rock fissures and crags in the face.  Footholds 
are scarce along the steep slopes of these mountains, cliffs run along the 
sides, and each footfall knocks loose a few small stones which tumble down, 
falling noiselessly into the valleys between the peaks.  Passage is slow
and tedious, and the high altitude leaves you feeling light headed.

Far above the puerile illogic of the sycophantic sheep that dot the
cities below, there is nothing here to debauch the unbroken planes of granite 
which do not yield, but instead converge with the clouds, forming graceful
curves about the aeonian explosion of stone.  As erect and resolute as 
a clenched fist thrust towards the heavens, it is hard to discern if these
peaks stand in reverence or defiance of the proximate celestial firmament.

A world of fierce wonder unfolds before you as you trek along the
mountain-ringed glacier basin that extends bowl-like, encompassing the north.
Striking views of gigantic snow-topped summits that pierce the clouds
contrast sharply with the plummeting glaciers that move ever so slowly
in the mountain cirque.  Turbulent gales of wispy snow batter you
consistently as you make your way along, numbing your face and blurring
your vision -- a beauty tempered by savagery.

A world of fierce wonder unfolds before you as you trek along the
mountain-ringed glacier basin that extends bowl-like, encompassing the north.
Striking views of gigantic snow-topped summits that pierce the clouds
contrast sharply with the plummeting glaciers that move ever so slowly
in the mountain cirque.  Turbulent gales of wispy snow batter you
consistently as you make your way along, numbing your face and blurring
your vision -- a beauty tempered by savagery.

S'approcher du paradis~
Perched on the edge of a granite cliff that defies both matter and motion
to defer to its immovable force, you are allowed the rare view of
unbroken sky.  So close is this infinite plane, it thrusts itself upon you
with the impetuousness of air currents, and envelops you with the sudden urge
to leap and float free upon the wind.  Solitude is your involuntary companion,
here where starkness reigns and the motionless world stoops to your unyielding
will.

Far above the puerile illogic of the sycophantic sheep that dot the
cities below, there is nothing here to debauch the unbroken planes of granite 
which do not yield, but instead converge with the clouds, forming graceful
curves about the aeonian explosion of stone.  As erect and resolute as 
a clenched fist thrust towards the heavens, it is hard to discern if these
peaks stand in reverence or defiance of the proximate celestial firmament.

A strange sense of piety instills itself in you as you raise your head
up to battle the battering winds, a defiant act from your person against
the great gods of stone that tower before you.  Off in the distance,
far below the rim of the glacial valley, you can see a profusion of lofty
foothills nestled in the shadow of these magnificent summits.  These verdant 
terraced hills meander out of sight, creating a strange reverse magnetism with
the harsh stone peaks that skyrocket into the clouds far above.

Trailing mists of windblown slow form a shardlike mane on the faces of the
massive rock walls that are the closest frontage of the humongous mountains

Glassy blue ice gathers in the crevices along the mountain face, some of it 
centuries old, the temperature never rising high enough for it to melt.
Jagged mountain peaks and precariously balanced boulders loom high above,
while steep cliffs and desolate slopes descend and provide limited passage
through this desolate range.  Few things manage to live at this high
altitude, some green-brown mosses and a few small spiders are all that survive
among the rocks and ice.

left banks, towers of nature rise to remarkable heights.  As you stride
through the pass you glance around in awe at the titans of nature, clothed
in armor of rocks and ice.

S'approcher du paradis~
Perched on the edge of a granite cliff that defies both matter and motion
to defer to its immovable force, you are allowed the rare view of
unbroken sky.  So close is this infinite plane, it thrusts itself upon you
with the impetuousness of air currents, and envelops you with the sudden urge
to leap and float free upon the wind.  Solitude is your involuntary companion,
here where starkness reigns and the motionless world stoops to your unyielding
will.

S'approcher du paradis~
A world of fierce wonder unfolds before you as you trek along the
mountain-ringed glacier basin that extends bowl-like, encompassing the north.
Striking views of gigantic snow-topped summits that pierce the clouds
contrast sharply with the plummeting glaciers that move ever so slowly
in the mountain cirque.  Turbulent gales of wispy snow batter you
consistently as you make your way along, numbing your face and blurring
your vision -- a beauty tempered by savagery.

S'approcher du paradis~
A strange sense of piety instills itself in you as you raise your head
up to battle the battering winds, a defiant act from your person against
the great gods of stone that tower before you.  Off in the distance,
far below the rim of the glacial valley, you can see a profusion of lofty
foothills nestled in the shadow of these magnificent summits.  These verdant 
terraced hills meander out of sight, creating a strange reverse magnetism with
the harsh stone peaks that skyrocket into the clouds far above.

S'approcher du paradis~
Glassy blue ice gathers in the crevices along the mountain face, some of it 
centuries old, the temperature never rising high enough for it to melt.
Jagged mountain peaks and precariously balanced boulders loom high above,
while steep cliffs and desolate slopes descend and provide limited passage
through this desolate range.  Few things manage to live at this high
altitude, some green-brown mosses and a few small spiders are all that survive
among the rocks and ice.

S'approcher du paradis~
High cliffs and peaks rise towards the sky, covered in ice and making a 
jagged line along the horizon.  Only a few determined plants cling desperately
to clumps of dirt wedged in rock fissures and crags in the face.  Footholds 
are scarce along the steep slopes of these mountains, cliffs run along the 
sides, and each footfall knocks loose a few small stones which tumble down, 
falling noiselessly into the valleys between the peaks.  Passage is slow
and tedious, and the high altitude leaves you feeling light headed.

Far above the puerile illogic of the sycophantic sheep that dot the
cities below, there is nothing here to debauch the unbroken planes of granite 
which do not yield, but instead converge with the clouds, forming graceful
curves about the aeonian explosion of stone.  As erect and resolute as 
a clenched fist thrust towards the heavens, it is hard to discern if these
peaks stand in reverence or defiance of the proximate celestial firmament.

Fore deck of the longship~
The deck of this ship is wide and flat.  A single square sail hangs from
a mast in the center of the ship just to the north.  Ships such as these can
travel fast, even in shallow waters.  To your south is the prow of the ship,
which has been carved into the shape of a fierce dragon's head.  This large
solid piece of wood can also be used as a battering ram to attack other
ships at sea.

Mid deck of the longship~
The mid deck is the center of activity on this ship.  The ship is widest
in the middle and anyone boarding or leaving the ship does so here.  A
single, sturdy mast rises thirty feet into the sky and hangs a single square
sail from a large crossbar.  The sail is `owhite`l with wide `nblue`l
stripes in a pattern that matches the shields carried by its occupants.  A
hatch leads below deck and the ship continues to the north and the south.

Aft deck of the longship~
Here at the aft of the ship, you can look north at the ocean behind and
to either side, or forward along the ship to the south.  The mast rises high
to your south and the giant square sail hangs down catching the wind and
propelling the wide flat boat with surprising speed, although when at sea,
speed is difficult to gauge with only the waves and clouds as your point of
reference.  Barbarian raiders move about the deck with confidence, tending
to their various duties in preparation for the next big attack on some
unsuspecting seaside town or vessel.

Below deck~
Although this is a flatboat, it does have a small area below deck.  This
must be a cargo area, although it's not very rooms.  Very little light gets
in and there are no portholes to see out from.  A ladder leads up to the
deck and there is a solid-looking door to your south.

Captain's Quarters~
The captain's quarters is a small room that has little purpose other than
to be a place for the ship's captain to sleep and to store a few items
safely under lock and key.  The room is small and featureless with a plain
bed against a wall and a door in the north wall.

`kIce Ridge``~
`hAtop a high ridge of ice, the great northern ocean comes into view for
the first time.  To the south lies only glacier-packed tundra and jagged
peaks that reach up to the sky past even the clouds.  Northward, the ridge
slopes down into a fjord, where water laps at a rocky shoreline amid chunks
of snow and frost.  The waves reflect the sun in shifting pinpoints, like a
broken mirror that shifts and rolls before your eyes.  The ubiquitous
freezing wind blows in from the sea, numbing your face and making you work
to keep your balance.  ``

`kAlong the Shore``~
`hThe rocky shoreline looks like a great grey scar separating the deep
blue sea from the snowy blanket that covers everything to the south.  An
ancient trail winds southward up to the ice ridge high above.  Smooth round
grey stones make up the beach here, each having been worn by eons of erosion
by the cycling waters that lap and break upon the coast.  The grey is only
broken by the bit of driftwood here, or the patch of snow there.  At sea,
huge iceburgs sit like islands, their caps hiding massive boat-wrecking
appendages below the surface of the waves.  To fall in these waters would be
death in seconds.  ``

Ice Cave~
`oThick white icicles hang down from the roof of this dark cave, blocking much
of the entrance, but also providing protection from the incessant winds, which
howl outside the entrance.  Bits of debris litter the floor, along with a few
pieces of platinum armor, beaten beyond repair and almost beyond the point of
recognition.  Clearly, this place was the last stand for a fierce battle, but
little can be determined, aside from the obvious fact that several have died
in this place.``
