the Castle Guardian~
The guardian knight of Castle Dunluce stands here. 
~
He is the very embodiment of all that is good and powerful with the
defenders of Castle Dunluce.  His face is hidden behind his shining visor
and he stands with back erect, watching for trouble makers.

water nymph~
A water nymph~
A water nymph circles you slowly here.
~
You can barely make out this form through the waters here, a fluid
creature with pointy ears that moves gracefully through the waters.  The
only thing you can see from her facial features is that she is female, and
exceptionally beautiful at that.  However, an evil glint lurks behind her
long lashed eyes, and she licks her lips and starts towards you.

Lord Brealey~
A handsome man stands here dressed primly for any occasion.
~
He is a handsome man, with long brown hair that has been swept back
across his face and away from his stern grey eyes.  He stands here with the
bearing of a man who is used to wearing fine clothes, and enjoys it very
much.

Lord Jholam~
A short man dressed in grungy clothing stands here.
~
Before you stands a short, gruff man that reaches barely up to your chest
level.  It is obvious that he once had some sort of growth deficiency, but
more than makes up for it by his cool and demanding stature.

A weak looking man with a tendency to annoy you stands here.

Before you stands a tiny, blue little thing that reminds you of the mold
that grows on your bread when you leave it out too long.  You are taken
aback when you realize that this is, in fact, a man, or something that
pretends to be a man.

he looks in.  His thick brows are slightly streaked with grey wisps,
matching the way his hair flows back across his head in tendrilly patterns.

Lord Dare~
A man is here, resplendent in his fine clothes and armor.
~
Lord Dare scowls back at you with fire in his eyes.  Apparently, he
doesn't like to be disturbed when he is in his quarters.  His bushy eyebrows
crinkle up in distaste, and the ends of his thick, brown lips curl up in a
petulant snarl.  The thick, corded muscles that cover his body tremble ever
so slightly, and you realize that you are probably in some trouble here.

she has long since outlived the rest of her generation.  From the frailness
of her bones and the rank smell about her, you can probably guess that she
doesn't have all that long to live.

A handsome and regal man stands here smiling.
~
He is perhaps the most handsome man you have ever seen.  Bright blue eyes
stare out from beneath long brown hair that has been swept off to the side. 
Even the careless way the hair seems to have been arranged looks perfect on
this man's face.  He also rests with the demeanor of one who is at ease with
himself and with anyone he comes into contact with.  Perhaps that explains
why Xavier is comfortable in this secluded corner of the castle, even though
he is the High Lieutenant of the Argent Lance.

Comfortably ensconced in this panoramic vantage point, King Athanmere passes his thoughtful gaze over the jewel of his ancestral kingdom, Thesden.
~
A large broad shouldered man, King Athanmere certainly bears semblance to
the legends that herald his younger years, when he was one of the most
feared defenders of the protectorate.  King Athanmere rules his kingdom with
the utmost care and vigilance, perusing tax collection reports and military
strategy reports constantly.

This girl jumps up in surprise as you intrude upon what was obviously a

across her half naked body, and bites her lip distraughtfully.  She looks as

Dear Diary, Today I decided to try for the world masturbation record. 
Unfortunately, I had to stop at six ejaculations, my hand hurt so bad and it
was becoming difficult to grab my tiny penis.  I was having a self esteem
problem earlier as well, I was trying to build an area but it kept turning
out like crap, I just don't know what the matter is with me!  Am I a loser
like everyone says I am?  Anyway Diary, I was thinking about saving up my
money to hire a prostitute or something, I feel so repressed and angry at
the world.  I wish people like <insert Sanctuary player name here> would
stop picking on me.  Sigh, sometimes I wish my parents had aborted me and
saved this world the trouble of having to deal with a prick such as myself.

ring~
This beautifully crafted ring has an unusual feature.  It's top pops open
to reveal a large hollow opening within it.  As you look down into the ring,
you realize that there might not be a bottom to it at all, very useful to
store liquids in don't you think?  (hint hint)

Naclario,
``     Thank you for your continued cooperation in this matter.  It is of utmost
importance that we keep the navy's discovery between us until we've consulted
the proper experts and know how to proceed.  It is imperative that nobody else
stumble onto it and become infected.  For the time being, we will simply blame
our losses on pirates.  That should buy us the time we need.

Before Castle Dunluce~
You stand here in awe, before a massive grey granite palace that sparkles
in the light that shines down upon its walls.  The riven rock almost appears
to be a sheer faced cliff here, as the walls slope ever so slightly upwards.
It is a marvel of architecture that something this massive, this powerful,
is carved from a single piece of stone.  Massive pinions jut out from the
stone wall in front of you.  As you examine carefully, you notice a fine,
rectangular series of cracks running with the grain of the granite.  Glowing
street lanterns to either side of the pinions seem conspicuously out of
place, an anachronism from a long ago age.  The whole scene radiates an old
magic, long forgotten in Thesden, but perhaps regaining strength.

Inside Castle Dunluce~
The massive granite gate swivels on its seven pinions and groans in
protest as some unseen force slams it back into place.  With the way back
closed off, you turn your attention to what lies ahead.  The walls here are
remarkably smooth, almost silky in texture.  Small, flickering lamps line
the walls every fifteen feet, casting dancing shadows across the musty
passageway.  Despite the musty smell, there is remarkably no dust coating
the polished floors.  The floors are a marvel in themselves, as they gleam
like mirrors underneath the people who have trod upon them.  You give
yourself a little time for your eyes to adjust, then decide to venture on.

A bend in the musty corridor~
The granite corridor takes a bend here, allowing you to go either east or
south.  The procession of flickering lanterns along the walls is only
interrupted by the intermittent artwork that has been placed here.  The
shadows that play off the lanterns highlight the high ceiling of the

A bend in the musty corridor~
The winding corridor inside the castle takes another turn here towards
the south.  Much like the hallway you have been in beforem lanterns line the
walls at about head level.  Upon closer inspection, you notice the telltale
signs of transit leading to the south.  Tiny droplets of a reddish fluid
also dot the vicinity.  A deep thrumming sound reverberates through the
passageway, a throaty murmur that gently rocks the granite stone about you. 
You aren't sure where the noise is coming from, so resonant is the sound.

Another turn in the corridor~
After leaving the brightly lit intersection behind you, the corridor
takes an abrupt turn to the east.  With the aid of light filtering in from
the intersection, you think you can see the outline of a door to the east. 
On the smooth hewn ground here, bits and pieces of stained, shorn steel lay
strewn randomly about, amidst bone white pieces of...  Bone!

A mahogany panel~
The corridor ends abruptly here in a granite wall that has been set with
a mahogany panel in its center.  The panel is about a foot off of the smooth
floor, and with approximately a foot between its edges and the corridor
walls.  The curious thing about the panel is that it looks like a door, yet
there is no handle, or any break or flaw in the wood grain pattern.  Lining
the panel are tiny, flaming blue lights that twitch fervently whenever you
look directly at them.  It does not require an experienced adventure to
understand that these are warning sigils of some type, the danger in the air
is imminent.

The glass constellation~
You enter a room and are stunned by the "blue" of it all.  Flaming blue
lights dot the room, million upon millions of them, like the twinkling of
the stars in the night, coalescing into a beautiful and soft azure backdrop.
In the center of the room, a circle of crudely cut rocks resides.  The rocks
are stacked about knee-high and enclose what appears to be water.  Upon
closer inspection however, you realize that the top of the pool is actually
a fine sheet of perfectly clear glass.  Upon that discovery, a thought dawns
on you.  If the few blue lights outside the panel meant danger, what does a
million mean?  With that, the mahogany panel slams shut behind you and
blends effortlessly into the wall, leaving you with no way out.

A musty corridor~
Leaving the gate behind you, you march down a high ceilinged corridor
with lamps at around head level.  They seem to point you south, where you
can see the makings of an intersection.  In contrast to the starkly austere
power and harshness of the granite walls, a finely woven `itapestry`l hangs
from the wall.  The mesh of cloth depicts an epic scene told in the most
brilliant hues of red and gold and amber.  It is of one of those titanic
clashes that few people in Thesden have ever heard of, let alone remember.

A musty corridor~
The corridor runs north and south here.  In both directions, you see that
the dimly lit path again changes its course.  The smell of long unwashed
clothing pervades the meandering hallway here, complementing rather not so
nicely the dank feeling in the atmosphere.  It is not uncomfortable, yet it
is not the luxurious haven you thought you should see in a castle of this
stature.

A bloody trail in the corridor~
The defining featire of this portion of the corridor is the trail of
crimson blood that runs along its length.  The trail is by no means
straight, as it careens about the corridor, lacing itself from side to side.
Shreds of a torn down tapestry lie in a crumpled and bedraggled heap here. 
It's impossible to tell what the tapestry once depicted, so defaced it is,
but what makes you wonder is that nobody has stopped to clean the mess up.

The Warren of Nashbar~
This room is smallish in nature, and decorated with a very foreign
flavor.  Paintings of a strange origin match the odd murals that adorn the
walls, most of them focusing on a goateed man clad in tight collared coat. 
Toppled urns and spilled bottles of fine wine tell you the stat of the
person who lives here.  The rumpled bed and half broken chandelier in the
corner of the room is cast in an eerie glow by a glowing green orb that
rests on a pedestal in the center of the room, pulsating slowly.

the light lancing in from the bright intersection to the east.  Directly to

light creeping through the small opening.  The hallway of stern granite
continues off to the south here.

A brightly lit intersection~
You have arrived at a large four way intersection that is brilliantly lit
in whites and blues.  So brightly lit is the intersection, that the granite
walls seem almost absent in the cascading illumination.  When you look up,
you can see the souce of the light.  Instead of the customary high ceiling
that you have seen before, a glass panel has been afixed in the ceiling. 
FIltering in from high up above is the light, a beam of pure energy that
refracts to the left and right, and splits into its component colors. 
Hallways lead in all directions here.

A bright corridor~
To the west in this corridor, it becomes lighter, adding a strange sense
of quick step ambience.  This is in addition to the fine artwork that adorns
th walls, tapestries, paintings, carvings.  One particular mural catches
your eye, a mountain rising out of the ground, reaching high above the
surrounding ocean.  Yet another painting shows the end result of the
transmogrification a castle resting upon the sheer face of a seaside cliff,
Castle Dunluce.

A musty corridor~
The hallway here ranges to the east and west.  Some of the lanterns along
the granite north wall seem brighter than the others, probably because they
tap a magical source that has been replenished recently.  To the east, you
can see that a four way intersection branches off into the depths of the
castle.

A 4-Way Intersection~
The flickering lamps along the walls shimmer off into all directions
here, creating a mesmerizing maze affect that leaves you feeling just a tad
bit nauseous, if not overwhelmed.  North, south, east and west, you can go
from here, that is, if you have the courage to continue onwards.  It smells
faintly of musk here, a cloying smell that reminds you of the local
blacksmith who always bathed too little, and worked too much.

A turn in the musty corridor~
The corridor runs either north or west from here.  The lanterns on the
grey granite walls are in their customary places here, slightly above and
behind your head.  The high ceilings of the castle are starting to lose
their grandeur, and makes you think about more mundane problems, such as how
to heat such a tall structure.

A bloody trail in the corridor~
The trail of speckled blood continues along the north-south axis of this
section of the corridor.  Peculiarly, the blood is moist to the touch here,
and carried with it, a slight coppery odor that clings to your clothes and
to the air itself.  People familiar with death and demise recognize the
stench as not only the smell of blood, but as the smell of fear and
anticipation.

`cBarracks of the Green Lance``~
This is the northwest corner of a large barracks area.  Small cots lined
with grungy olive blankets lay spaced a scant five feet apart, give or take
the occasional inch.  Foot lockers lay at the base of each bed, and a steel
reinforced closet stands against the wall here.  The floor is conspicuously
neat here, as if it has just been scrubbed.  Otherwise, the granite walls
and ceiling are plain and unadorned, although big glowing globes float in
the air, shining brightly on everything below them.

This room is brightly lit by four glowing bulbs bobbing up and down in
the air.  They cast a soft glow across the furnishings in the room, which
consist of a bed pushed up against the back wall, and various chairs and
desks against other walls.  The whole decor is orange and blue in nature,
right down to the tapestry on the wall, which shows a map of a land that
nobody has probably ever seen before.  The carpeting is a simple rug,
trimmed in orange, with a large orange circle, criss crossed by black lines
in the center.

sits here to the west, closed and uninviting.

lanterns that light your way, there is not much of interest in this
passageway.

This room is the northwest corner of a large area filled with tightly
packed cots, foot lockers, and a few closets lined up along the walls.  The
entire barracks is painted in an austere white, trimmed with not so delicate
black and gold.  The blankets are likewise colored, made from a coarse,
crude wool that looks like it will be very itchy.

from pegs on the walls, no other notables are around in this area.

floats ethereally in the background.

A turn in the bloody trail~
The bloody trail becomes even more articulate here, and you begin to
envision it as the trail of a bloody and battered body being dragged hair by
hair, inch by inch over the smooth surface of the granite floor.  The
crimson blood is warm to the touch, life radiating off from lifeblood, heat
leaving life.  The corridor turns sharply here, allowing you to head either
south or east.  A final but important detail that you almost did not manage
to see is that, for the first time, you can see a crack in the wall of the
castle, a thin spidery thing that runs from halfway up the west wall down to
the floor.

A turn in the bloody trail~
The blood on the granite floor takes a turn to the west and north here,
following the corridor's carved out path.  The blood appears even more fresh
and fluid here then you would imagine possible in a place as busy as Castle
Dunluce.  Some of the lanterns on the walls here are a bit faded, an ominous
portent, along with the torn-down and y partly visible painting on the
floor.  A cracked urn lies on its side here, yet another mute testament to
the progressions of a sinister deed in the castle.

This section of the barracks is like all of the rest of it.  Green woolen

head and feet at the same time.  Decoration and comfort were definitely not
at a premium here, as the walls and floors are similarly bare.

The barracks here are more of the same.  Green, woolen blankets cover
uncomfortable looking, pine-wood cots, hardly the luxury you are accustomed
to seeing in the rest of Castle Dunluce.  The typical communal scent of
sweat and body odors lingers in the air here.  Otherwise, in typical
military style, the barracks are indescript and pretty darn boring.

A jagged stairwell~
At last, the granite corridor comes to an abrupt end.  Chiseled into the
north wall is a jagged staircase that spirals slowly upwards.  The flames
along the stairwell are a brilliant amber red, the ancient Thesdenian color
of direction and seeking.  Other than that, the staircase appears to be the
same as a million other staircases you have ever seen before.  A hanging
tapestry with the three crescent moon symbol of Thesden partially obscures
the top of the stairway, hiding what lays beyond.

Quarters of Rowena~
The room you have entered is very esoteric to say the least.  Besides the
thin sheen of black silk draped all around the granite of the walls, exotic
looking flowers, herbs, and spixes hang frombrass hooks that have been
attached to the ceiling.  A silver ball about two feet in diameter, and
displayed in a cherry wood case completes the picture.  The granite floor
has been left bare, and no other sign of furnishings is to be found.  There
is a smell of marjoram in the air that seems to crawl up and into your nose,
clinging despite its pleasant odor.

The end of a hallway~
The hallway comes to an abrupt end here as a granite wall bars the way
any further to the south.  A sturdy looking oak door stands to the west has
been painted the darkest shade of blue, and is inlaid with bits of ivory and
gold.  The flecks cling to a small gold knocker hanging in the center of the
door and beckons to your hand.  A small peephole sits directly above the
knocker.  Curiously, you are unable to see into the peephole, but you can
bet one can see out from it.

the flames on the east wall mask where a painted, steel-reinforced door
stands slightly ajar.  From behind the door, you can hear faint clanking
noises, and an odor of oil, cured leather, and well kept steel wafts in from
the doorway.  Mumbling voices echo down the hallway as well, the direction
of origin is uncertain...

there is so much equipment around.  The walls each have a triple crescent
moon symbol plaque of the Castle Dunluce nailed to them, adorned with a red
and green woolen background.  In contrast, every blanket and locker and
closet here is painted or woven a stark, deep black.

Dunluce.  Flickering lanterns at a little bit above eye level and a smooth
grey granite, silky to the touch.  A small plate is fastened to the wall
here, and on it, the visage of an old man.  His face is nondescript for a
person that is so wizened, and you have no idea who it could be, or why it
sits on this lonely, forlorn stretch of hallway in the middle of the castle.

The blood pooling on the grey granite floor is even thicker here, and the
air reeks of that all too familiar smell of human innards.  Some of the
blood spatters up disdainfully, staining your footwear as proof that indeed,
the blood is fresh.  The corridor turns off to the east, where you can see
the hallway cminate in a large, iron door.  A smattering of adventurer's
equipment lies on the ground here, and you wonder yet again, why nobody
seems to know or care what is going on here.

Before a Liquid Door~
The long, liquid trail of blood ends here, and disappears under a
massive, black door.  The door is not made of any material you have ever
seen before however.  It seems to melt, flow from the top to the bottom in a
perpetual stream, recycling itself every few seconds, bringing the fluid at
the bottom of the door back up to the top.  The effect is one of shimmering,
a dark reflection of your lighter side.  A small sigil floats in the liquid
door, at about head level.  It is a curious, squiggly looking figure, a
spiral eating in upon itself, pale and glowing against its dark backdrop.

Berserker Quarters~
You stand in an elliptically shaped room, completely bare of any type of
ornamentation.  In fact, the only thing of note in this room is the round
table that sits in the middle of the room.  On this table is an impressive
collection of human bones, teeth marks clear evidence that this table is
probably the dinner table.  Savage slash marks mar the walls, as if the
resident here did not like the idea of being holed up here.  It is the
chamber of the Berserker, the self appointed, partially insane guardian of
Castle Dunluce, formerly one of the most feared warriors in Thesden.

names of past heroes of Castle Dunluce.  At the foot of each bed is a small,
black painted, iron locker.  On top of each bed is a forest green coarse
woolen blanket.  Large glowing bulbs float in the air which provide the
lighting here.  Guards mill about here, either preparing for patrol duty or
for a most uncomfortable nap.

A musty corridor~
The granite hallway here starts sloping upwards slightly, evinced more by
the slant of the hallway lanterns that by any slope of the floor path here. 
A bit further to the north, you think you can make out the boxy forms of a
staircase in the darkness.  South of here, the corridor takes a turn to the
west.

At the end of the hallway~
You have arrived at the end of the long hallway.  The granite wall has
turned ahead in front of you, barring the way any further to the west. 
However, there is a closed, ashwood door painted a stolid grey to the south.
It is marked with the ancient symbol of the ankh, chiseled in blue and
trimmed in a glossy white substance, the symbol seems to radiate and throb
with an energy that is its own, a guardian symbol that stands over the
doorway in front of you.

A musty corridor~
The corridor runs to the east and west here.  To the east, the hallway
takes a turn to the north.  It's pretty hard to say much about this faded
piece of granite passageway, it provides an ends to a means.  It's the only
way you would be able to travel through a castle.  Can you imagine a castle
without hallways?  It would be just one chucnk of rock wouldn't it?  Not
much of a castle.

The granite corridor turns here.  The flickering lanterns on the wall
mark the ways to which you can travel here, north and west.  Footfalls echo
through the castle hallways as you sit here, pondering your next move
through the musty and warm passageways.  A particularly bright tapestry that
wraps around the corner of the hallway catches your eye here as well.

`aBarracks of the Black Lance``~
This is the southwest corner of a large barracks area.  Black, woolen
blankets cover cots separated by a scant four or five feet.  Defenders of
Castle Dunluce hustle about, going on with their assignments.  A small foot
locker lies at the foot of each bed a tall iron cabinet also stands against
the south wall here, closed and locked tight.

This is the southeast corner of a barracks area that is littered with
cots covered with black woolen blankets.  A small iron foor locker rests at
the base of each cot here, in addition to the tall iron banded cabinet
standing against the southern wall.  The entire scene is one of pristiness
and properness, a bastion of order and law inside the heart of Castle
Dunluce.

An intersection in Castle Dunluce~
You have arrived at a fork in the corridor here.  The flickering lanterns
on the walls stretch out to the east, and also continue to the south here. 
The intersection itself is somewhat rounded as the corners of each corridor
have been polished away, leaving you with an atrium of sorts.  A large,
glowing ball adds additional illumination to the intersection.  Around the
rounded walls of the intersection, a mural has been painted.  It is simply a
painting of noble citizens, feasting at a long table.  From the city and
color of the livery, you recognize the people as the Lords of Thesden.

A musty corridor~
This is yet another musty-odored corridor that tires your mind and
irritates your nose.  Both to the east and west, you think you can make out
intersections in the grey granite corridors.  ACHOO!  You better get out of
here before your allergies start to act up again.

An intersection in Castle Dunluce~
The granite walled corridor splits off into three different directions
here, you are able to head east, west, and south.  South of here, the
corridor quickly turns into a small alcove, dimly lit, and decorated with
plants, and a few assorted pieces of artwork.  It looks quaint, or as quaint
as a place can be in this rather impersonal and hard castle.

A musty corridor~

spacing of the lanterns on the walls are interrupted both to the north and
south by doors.  To the north is an olive green, freshly painted door.  A
plaque h angs next to the door that is inscribed with the triple crescent
moon symbol of Thesden.  Underneath this is the inscribed word, "`cBarracks
`cof the Green Lance`l".  The door to the south is a less descript one, made
of oak and unlocked, unadorned.

to go north or west.  Off to the north however, you think you can make out
the faintly diabolic tinges of red rose flickering lights.  It may or may
not be an ominous portent, at least it does not send those shivers of dread
anticipation through your spine.

The House of Xavier~
This room is a forty by forty foot dazzling array of royal blue and
silver.  Brightly burnished armor pieces adorn the walls.  Acoompanying
cloaks of royal blue hang from wooden pegs dotting the room.  Towards the
back of the room, a large comfortable looking bed is covered with a blue,
down blanket, weighed down by a pair of large, fluffy pillows.  A desk rests
against the north wall, and a matching mahogany coffee table stands against
the south wall.  In addition, a silver-chased wardrobe stands at the foot of
the bed, closed, and locked.

The House of Kodiak~
This is the residence of one of the younger, more volatile Lords of
Thesden.  Garishly decorated in bright greens, reds, and yellows, this room
is most unpleasing to the eye.  The only pieces of furniture in the room are
a natty sofa bed and a small, worm eaten writing desk.  A bundle of dice and
a stack of playing cards resting on the desk tell you about the hobbies of
this young Lord.  A broken clock on the wall and a tipped over lamp in the
corner show you the slovenliness of the Lord as well.

The musty corridor is fairly confusing here.  The hallway leads off to
the south, however, the way south is divided by a wall from another
passageway south slightly farther to the east.  Like I said, it was
confusing...  A run down door is closed to the west, the dull beige paint
long since fresh, chipping away and revealing the previous coat of turquoise
paint that lies underneath.

An Intersection in Castle Dunluce~
You have arrived at yet another intersection in Castle Dunluce.  On the
north wall, a breath taking tapestry depicting an epic struggle between two
magicians, each encapsulated in their own nimbus of crackling magical
energy.  The tapestry has even managed to capture the emotion on the
magician's faces, hideously contorted both in concentration and in pain. 
The magicians themselves could be from any time, any age, wielding a power
that transcends all worlds and times.

A musty corridor~
The dark, rather cool corridor runs east and west here.  The walls are
bare granite, a perfect complement to the chilling wind that whips through
the corridor here.  It is a biting wind, smelling of dissolved salts and the
washed up victims of the tide.  It is a quick reminder that beyond the walls
of Castle Dunluce is the sea itself, the rolling currents of saltwater
crashing up against the cliffs below.

and deeper into Castle Dunluce.  Perhaps it has something to do with the
sharp gusts of wind that occasionally flush down through the hallways they
taste tangy, and always come in from the south.

bars of hard black steel, and painted a rich midnight blue.  Inlaid gold
leaf flakes dance around the edges of the door.  There isn't much else of
interest here, the hallway ends in a granite wall to the west, and leads off
back where you came from to the east.

giving it the appearance of the front porch of a house.

paintings.  To the south, further down the hallway, you can see a door at

looking hallway fork.

line the ground.  It seems fairly domestic here.

tang of salt water on your lips as the wind whips through the corridor here,
twisting and turbulent, shearing against the walls and your face like some
sort of invisible sand paper.  In fact, with all the turbulence, you can't
even be sure where exactly the wind is coming from.

The granite wall carefully slopes to the north here and east here,
allowing you to go in those directions.  The lanterns on the walls continue
to light your way forward (or backward as the case may be).  However, the
high ceiling seems to be sloping downwards here.  Perhaps this is due to the
winding staircase you can see at the end of the hallway to the east.

staircase that you can see directly to the east here.  Banners with the
triple crescent moon symbol of Thesden line this alcove, intricately
embroidered with the finest colored silks and satins, ambers and resins. 
They are massive and brush the top of your head as you pace through the
hallway.

as smooth as the walls of each corridor you have passed, and are nearly as
polished.  Each step has a banner hanging above it, the base level having
the triple crescent moon symbol of Thesden embroidered across its green
background.  The remainder of the banners seem to be personal crests of some
type, ostensibly those of the Lords of Thesden.

This room is brilliantly decorated in only the finest shades of blue. 
From the sky-blue walls to the midnight blue of the carpeting to the
aquamarine of the bed that rests in the corner, the room is blue from wall
to wall, floor to ceiling.  Decorative urns and bits of rare pottery dot the
room, complementing the somewhat haphazard layout of the desk, reading
table, and bureau.  The furniture is made of a beautiful jiminy wood, laced
with strips of ivory blue.  A globe with the world of Firense on it rests,
glowing on the desk.

west wall, covered with fine beddings, and embroidered with a gold, wingless
dragon, turning in upon itself and eating its own tail.  Several dressers
and vanities line the walls here, made from fine cherry wood that glistens
black in the light.  A chest at the foot of the bed, partially open, catches
your eye, you thought you saw gold in there as well.

A residential alcove~
This small cul-de-sac is lined with verdant potted plants, various urns
made from polished brass, and various tapestries depicting some of the many
battles for control of Castle Dunluce.  The tapestry that first catches your
eye is a finely woven silk hanging that shows the visage of a young man,
frayed goatee and coat flapping loosely in the wind.  He stands above the
sheer cliffs that frame Castle Dunluce, staring out into the sea, defiantly
glaring at the ships that approach the castle.  His demeanor is inspiring,
you can only assume that he was one of the Greater Lords.  In any case, a
sturdy oaken door stands to the south here, cutely decoated with plant
leaves and tree twigs.

Paintings and tapestries line the walls, none of any particular note.  Two,
blue, glowing lanterns hang on the wall to either side of a large,
reinforced oak door to the south.  The door is unadorned and has a slightly
beaten look to it.  A faded welcome mat rests at the front of the door,
slightly displaced from the passage of people through the door.

salty tang of the air.  To the west, the granite corridor takes a turn to

the wall continue up to that wall, lighting your way onwards to the very
end.

The corridor ends~
The granite walls of this corridor merge to meet a granite wall to the
east, blocking the way any further in that direction.  The east wall is lit
by a single flaming white lantern, blazing like a strip of condrenum lit
with a torch.  The lantern straddles a small, spidery crack in the center of
the wall, running from ceiling to floor.  You notice that the east wall is
also a rosey shade of granite, a stark contrast to the drab and powerful
granite you have seen so far in Castle Dunluce.

You stand at the foot of a briliantly lit staircase, made of the finest,
meticulously polished, white marble.  The stairway spirals upwards to
another doorway at the top.  The stairway's bannister is gilt with polished
gold and tenuously clings to the edge of the stairs themselves.  The room
itself is circular and ringed with carefully polished mirrors that seem to
capture the light and magnify it to focus on a clear ball resting on a tall
marble pedestal in the center of the floor.  Images seem to swirl about
within the hall, random images of the castle, Thesden, your home.

stink of many a decanter of fine wine, bourbon, and brandy.  A circular
table, covered with a fine green cloth sits in the center of this smallish,
wood panelled room, where several young men sit playing at stones and cards.
The room is dimly lit and has the ambience of a private club.  Discarded and
shattered wine glasses litter the sticky stone floor, adding to the general
decadence and mayhem of the room.  The card players look up at your entrance
yet do not seem surprised by your intrusion.

A rope catwalk~
You stand on a rope catwalk that connects the four battlement sides of
Castle Dunluce.  The catwalk looks fairly sturdy, as it has been reinforced
by steel bolts running through the wood at frequent intervals.  A stone
platform somehow is suspended in the center of the catwalk system a short
distance above that is a taller turret, aglow in brilliant light.  It's too
bad you can't get to that turret.

The Cove of Naya~
This room is decorated in only the lightest shades of blue, bordering on
the white.  Fragile looking furniture lines the walls of the room, a bed, a
desk, a wardrobe, and various chairs.  The centerpiece of the room is a
small well that has been placed into the center of the room.  As you look
into its crystal clear waters, you come to the conclusion that it has no
bottom.  Large, blue-tinged opals line the rim of the well, giving it the
appearance of a small shrine.  Light glints off those gems, reflecting small
beams of energy onto the tapestries on the walls these depict magnificent
scenes of leaping dolphins and of the sea itself, crashing waves, powerful
and grand.

This room is extremely messy and most pungent to behold.  Broken bottles
and used contraceptives litter the floor and bed, the only piece of
furniture in the room.  Dirt and dust cakes the corners of the room, it
looks as if it is used only for the occasional extracurricular frolick.  The
magical flames on the plain granite walls that cannot be extinguished have
somehow gone out, a true tribute to the gross negligence of this Lord of
Thesden.

the castle reach up to your chest here, pocked with arrow slits from which
you can fire down upon invading enemies.  A rope catwalk leads away to the
south, away to the connecting hub of the battlements.

A reinforced ladder~
This room is tiny, a circular shape of roughly ten feet in diameter.  A
rough-hewn ladder made of corrugated iron leads up into the granite ceiling,
fading into the darkness there.  To the east, an unpainted and smelly steel
door stands barred and locked.  The lighting in this tiny area is provided
by blue flamed lanterns that ring the room at both eight feet and sixteen
feet above the floor.

A turn in the plaza~
The richly decorated plaza hallway turns here, allowing you to head
either east or south.  To the west is an incongrous looking, stark steel
door, standing closed and locked.  The hallway is carpeted with a thick red
plush, it almost makes you want to remove your footwear and wiggle your
toes.  The walls are likewise richly decorated in tapestries, murals, and
decorative lamps that radiate a myriad of colors as you watch them.  In
fact, it is so richly decorated that the granite walls of Castle Dunluce are
barely visible.

The plaza hallway~
This hallway runs east and west here.  Rich, plush red carpet covers the
floorway, and tapestries and paintings cover the walls.  To the east, you
can see the top of a stairway leading down and an unpainted vertical slab of
steel to the west.  Light filters down onto the plaza walkway by means of
horizontal slats that have been carved into the granite ceiling here.

You have arrived at an intersection from where you can go east, west, or
south.  To the east, a stairwell begins and heads downwards.  The floor here
is covered with a plush, red carpet, slightly beaten down with the passage
of many a booted foot.  Intricately woven tapestries line the walls,
obscuring the harsh granite walls of Castle Dunluce.  A pair of bubbling
fountains stick out fromthe sides of the walls, the water gurgling through a
pair of sculpted fish.

A stairway alcove~
You stand in a hexagonal shaped room, with a jagged granite staircase
that spirals rapidly downward.  Red flamed lanterns spiral along with the
stairs and light the stairwell as well.  A mural runs about the
circumference of the room, depicting what people in Thesden affectionately
refer to as THE CHARGE.  Knights in gleaming armor with lances at the ready,
riding into a vast army of demon fiends, poison weapons bared and flashing. 
To the west, you can see where the ground becomes carpeted in a thick red
plush, its also a lot brighter to the west.

The northern battlements~
You stand on the northern battlements of Castle Dunluce, the massive
granite ceiling of the entire castle.  Off to the north you can see the city
of Thesden itself, a small little sprawl that bustles with people that look
like ants racing around a race track.  North of that, you can see the
plainsland stretch off for miles, a magnificent scene worthy of a second
look.

The House of Jholam~
This room is decorated in a tasteful combination of blue and gold/yellow.
A diagonally striped bed spread covers the small bed lying in the northwest
corner.  In fact, you notice that all the furniture in the room is pint
sized, half again too small for the average human.  Banners from various
nations hang from the walls, as do various animal head trophies.  Sitting on
the bearskin rug in the center of the room is a small shortsword
inscripture, gleaming in the lantern light.

and south.

and black and gold battle tunics decorate the walls and wardrobe here.  A
barren looking pinewood bed lies against the north wall here, as does a
beaten looking dresser.  Otherwise, the walls and floors are bare and stern,
ugly in their most basic form.  Swords and axes lay within an arm's reach at
almost every point in this room, sharpened as if this person expected battle
at any time, at any place.

carpet, that sinks succulently with each of your steps.  An ugly looking
oaken door stands in the west wall, and a slightly more attractive rose
colored door looms to the east.  The hallway continues to the north and
south here.

This room appears more like an armory than any sort of bedroom.  At least
five sets of silvery burnished armor hangs from the walls as well as do
finely honed swords, maces and spears.  A deep brown is the color of choice
for this room, matched by the bedspread and bearskin rug on the floor.  A
large mirror, oval and glistening with some sort of moisture, hangs on the
far wall, eerily reflecting your image.  Otherwise, the room is stark and
austere.

A brightly lit pit~
The moment you step into this room, you reazlie with horror that there is
no floor in this brilliantly lit chamber,.  As you stumble and begin to
fall, you see a fine line running about an inch below the level of the door.
Whe you crash into an invisible surface of glass, you realize that the floor
and ceiling are made of an entirely clear form of steel.  A brilliant light
floods in from up above, blinding the details of the room.  Below you, you
see the bottom floor of Castle Dunluce, a brightly lit granite seems to
shine in the brilliance of the illumination.

You stand in a misty room that is barely visible for all the crap
floating around in the air.  You have heard stories about Castle Dunluce's
legendary Defenders of Lore, but they all contradict each other.  Some say
they are repulsive carnivorous creatures, others say that they are kind,
benevolent folk that guide people through the maze of the castle.  At this
point, you tend to think the latter, you feel no hatred in this room, just
the ominpresent eyes that watch you in this section of the castle.

This room is richly decorated in various shades of green and cream.  The
carpeting and wall decor are a deep forest green and the furniture is a
contrasting, pristine white.  Large, brass urns stand in three corners of
the room, slightly tarnished from years of weather and aging.  In the fourth
corner, a globe rests on a wooden tripod, with Thesden in its center.  You
can see clearly how Thesden relates to the surrounding ocean in this
pictorial diagram.

Intricately worked tapestries cover the granite harshness of the walls, as
do well covered lanterns and stylish paintings and portraits of the Lord of
Thesden.  A young man wearing a crown made from laurels and a chain link
vest is the focus of the largest portrait here.  His face is boyishly happy,
but beyond the surface, staring into his deep green eyes, you see the stern
capacity, and the mettle that made him a great leader.

The House of Dare~
This room is brightly decorated with golden-yellow tassles that hang from
hooks on the walls and ceiling.  They brush lightly against your face
occasionally, making you a bit itchy and uneasy.  Attached to each of the
golden cords approximately halfway up their length is a small, steel wrought
pin in the shape of a crescent moon.  Occasionally, you see smaller pins
affixed to the tassles in addition to the moon.  Judging from the chevrons
and stripes that adorn those pins, you assume that they are coat of arms.  A
bed and dresser also grace the room, as well as a tall, inaccurate looking
pendulum clock.

The plaza hallway~
The hallway here is richly decorated with hanging tapestries and a thick,
plush carpet.  The tapestries here depict the Battle of Deep Brook, fearsome
demons wending their way through the tendrils of Deep Brook Swamp, while the
combined might of Thesden's commoners and nobility brace themselves to
resist.  The artwork is exquisite, you can see each and every bead of sweat
on every man's face, and the contorted screams and howls of every demon.  So
real is the image that you can almost hear the sounds of battle, and taste
the brute copper of fear.

painted in an off white, and are adorned by various copper and brass bands
that have been affixed vertically to the walls.  A bed rests against the far
wall of the room, as does a smallish dresser.  A white fur rug, with an
amazingly soft look and feel, graces the floor beneath your feet.  The
entire flavor of the room is one of gross indulgence, of happy living and
spending.

Lore Quarters~
You stand in a misty chamber, hexagonal in shape, the home of the
Defenders of Lore here in Castle Dunluce.  Legend has it that they keep the
sacred vials in preparation for the final day, others say they roam the
castle in search of flesh to eat and animals to sacrifice.  Whatever the
case may be, you feel no evil here, just the content solace of one who
cannot see anything and who, in their oblivious naivety, thinks the world is
a beautiful place.

The misty hallway continues to the east and south here, very difficult to
see much beyond the tips of your fingers and toes.  Somehow, you can make
out the outline of a door to your west.  The mist itself is cool and
refreshing, making you feel confident, even courageous when in most cases,
blindness only causes fear.

A misty hallway~
Suddenly, you find yourself walking through a hallway that has become
enshrouded in mist.  It bubbles and glides over your feet and face, a cool
refreshment that smells slightly of earthen moss.  The mist is thinner here
than to the west however, and you can make out the shape of a door just to
the north of here.

You stand in a room that smells just terrible!  You aren't sure exactly
where that smell comes from until you realize that you are standing in up to
a foot in a deep brown muck.  It flows gently around your feet, and with a
nauseous feeling, you realize that it is human feces.  Apparently, the
residence of this room has a problem with garbage and ridding himself of his
own waste.  However, the resident of this abode had no problem discarding
the pieces of paper in the wastebasket in the corner.

here, covering the granite in layer after layer of design.  To the west, a
deep orange door stands slightly ajar.  Otherwise, the hallway continues to

The House of Findal~
This room is highlighted by the absence of any furniture or decor at all.
However, it is extremely bright in here, although it is impossible to tell
from what direction the light comes from.  The entire ceiling glows with the
whitewashed sheen of brilliance, a mass of illumination that throbs and
flickers with each step that you take.  It is hard to believe, but it seems
that this room is alive, a sentience that you are only beginning to
understand.

The hallway here is covered in a deep, thick red carpet, that squishes
down each time you take a step, then rebounds as you release your foot. 
Intricate tapestries line the walls, the motif here belonging to the cliffs
of Thesden, dominating and awe inspiring sheer drop offs that have been the
death of more than one person.  Between tapestries, a space has been left
for doors, both to the east and west.  The hallway also continues to the
north and south.

wardrobe standing against the north wall reveals several blue and gold
surcoats, all embroidered with a triple crescent moon as well as a rearing
dolphin.  Swords hang on pegs form the wall, as well as a fair number of
cloaks, doublets, and sashes.  Matching scabbards and bolts of cloth lay in
other corners of this room.

Lore Quarters~
This room is stark in comparison with other rooms you have seen elsewhere
in the castle.  Perhaps it is because of the deep mist that enshrouds
everything in the room, making it impossible for you to see past a few feet
beyond your face.  As you stand here pondering the moment and the scene, you
think you can make out the faint hitches of movement in the mist, someone is
here, someone is watching you.

A misty hallway~
You stand in a hallway shrouded in deep mist that roils over and under
your feet, and body in general.  It is not one of those foreboding mists
that you have read about in story books, not one of those diabolical mists
that tear at your flesh and eat at your bones.  It is benign, and seems to
utter words of calm as you pace through it.  One curious thing is that you
have no idea where it is coming from, it isn't common at all for mist to
collect in a random hallway inside a castle.  In any case, through the mist,
you can barely make out the hallway continuing to the north and south, and
the door to the west.

This is the top of a deeply chiseled staircase that runs in a tight
spiral downwards to the level below.  A gilt brass banister runs along the
side of the staircase, providing some support as you look down on the
dizzying fall.  Flags hang along the stairwell walls, representing various
cities and nations of the land.  Flickering lanterns along the walls provide
the ghostly illumination in the stairwell.

This room is a dark room, with a stale, dank, unbathed feeling about it. 
Thick, blood red drapes hang from runners along the ceiling and walls, as
well as a number of strange looking brass bars, their purpose unknown.  The
floor is covered in a matted, downtrodden version of the plush, red carpet
outside in the hallway.  Other than the bed resting against the far wall,
the only furniture in this room are the rows and rows of bookcases lining
the walls.  Some of the bindings look freshly done, however, most are old
and tattered certainly there are a lot of them.

filtering in from the slats up above.

is much cozier with all the entrapments here that would normally be the
case, especially more so than the harsh granite walls that the rest of
Castle Dunluce seems to exhibit.

The House of Ranfor~
This is yet another bedroom of a Thesden Lord.  Stylized, inlaid bits of
colored ivory have been set into the floor here, giving it an almost orange
tinge that is difficult to derive from ivory.  A massive, ornate and
curtained bed lies against the far wall, neatly made and tucked away. 
Clothes lay in neat piles against the north wall eye catching in their
variety of flashy yellows, blues, and oranges.  A small, vanity chest rests
at the foot of the bed, a small crack showing you where the chest is
supposed to open.  To the west is a sturdy oaken door, probably where you
came in from.

You enter this room and are immediately overwhelmed by the billows of

for a faint shimmering that glows on the far wall.  As you make your way
towards that shimmer, a massive sign with `ired`l painted letters becomes
visisble.  "Closed until further notice.  -- Ethereal Portal".

The hallway here continues to be covered in a deep mist, and you are just
now beginning to understand just why the hallway is so misty.  Shapes
occasionaly coalesce in the mist, into the forms of humans and of other
sentinent beings.  They hide themselves in the mist, watching you for any
sign of mischief or bad intentions.  A door can be seen off to the west,
while the misty hallway continues off to the north.

brilliantly lit marble spirals away downward to the atrium below, a hallway
leads off to the south.  Glowbulbs hang from steel rods here, providing
light to the cul-de-sac.  Fern fronds and other plants rest in pots here in
the alcove.  Adding a much needed breath of nature to the hardness of Castle
Dunluce.

This is a small room with rather sparse furnishings.  A cot rests against
one wall and piles of dirty looking tunics and breeches litter the ground. 
To the south is a smallish door, painted green and looking rather cheap for
the grandeur of the castle.

A storeroom~
This room is neatly stacked with a multitude of clean, linen sheets, and
fine satin drapes.  They do not seem to come in a wide variety of colors
however, as green and white seem to be the dominant shades of choice here. 
The room also appears to be monofunctional, as it is unadorned, bare, and a
little bit musty in addition to the overwhelming scent of linen.

Before a golden door~
You stand before a massive golden door, hinged on a pair of ivory shells
that somehow can support the weight of what is a massively dense material. 
There are no visible handles or door knobs to the door either, and the
hinges favor the outside, telling you that this door swings towards you. 
It's a bit of a problem trying to open a massive door, with no handle, that
is tightly sealed against the face of the granite wall.  But even besides
that problem, you discover yourself going slowly blind as you stare into the
blinding glare that the golden door gives off.

The golden staircase~
Before you is an amazingly ornate staircase, gold, but with the
appearance of flecked marble.  No banister graces the side of the staircase
as it winds upwards, confident in the traveler's own ability to keep his own
balance.  The light in the chamber emanats from the stairs themselves, they
give off a pulsing glow that reaches into every corner of the round room.  A
small spring bubbles forth where you suspect the center of the room is,
crystal clear and with a sweet aroma, if water can smell like anything at
all.  A golden doorway leads to the west also, handleless and magnificent.

The northern battlements~
You stand on the northern battlements of Castle Dunluce, the massive
granite ceiling of the entire castle.  Off to the north you can see the city
of Thesden itself, a small little sprawl that bustles with people that look
like ants racing around a race track.  North of that, you can see the
plainsland stretch off for miles, a magnificent scene worthy of a second
look.

The Servants Quarters~
The hallway here is constructed of granite, as a matter of fact, it is
exactly the same as the previous level of Castle Dunluce, where everything
is hard and grey and lit by magical lanterns that hang from walls and from
the high ceiling up above.  The hallway smells slightly of dust and ammonia.
To the north you can see the bannister of a staircase leading down.  A
smallish door also stands to the south, red and slightly ajar.  The corridor
also continues to the east.

granite.  Small doors lead both to the north and south, while the hallway

aren't sure why it is unusual though.

The Servants Quarters~
This portion of the hallway is none too decorated and smells of long
dried and caked on ammonia.  The floors and walls have been religiously
scrubbed and gleam brightly in the dim light.  The hallway leads to the east
and west here, also a smallish doorway stands in the north wall.

The Servants Quarters~
The hallway comes to an end here.  The air smells of the residue at the
bottom of a janitor's cleaning pail.  However the walls and floor speak of a
a religious, daily cleansing.  A small door leads to the north, however,
what dominates your vision is the gaping chasm that leads off to the south. 
You aren't sure where it came from, or why there happens to be a deep
blackened pit in the center of the castle, perhaps it is for defense
purposes...  In any case, a thin bridge spans the chasm, constructed of rope
and tied around pinions that have been forced into the granite floor.

A shimmering alcove~
You stand in an alcove of the castle that is awash in golden light. 
Streams of metal flecked glints pour into the area from the north, where the
very light itself conceals the source of the illumination.  You can,
however, see that the alcove continues to the east here and that a rickety
looking rope bridge leads away to the south.

A shimmering alcove~
Alas, you have arrived at a dead end!  Light pours into the area from the
west, a warm pulsating golden glow that touches your blood and tickles your
insides.  The only way to go from here is back to the west, unless you can
find some sort of secret door here.  (Which will be impossible since the
creator of the castle didn't put any in here.)

Falling!!!~
You've slipped off the bridge and find yourself plummeting downwards into
utter blackness.  As you fall, you have time to reflect what you have
experienced in your life, your first kiss, your first ale, and the first
time you urinated in your pants before a big battle.  You sit and brace
yourself for the impact as you fall, thinking, wishing, that you had a
RECALL spell.

The Chambers of Selanne~
Upon entering this room, you are at first given the impression that it is
a Lord's domicile.  An ornate bed, a cherry wood wardrobe, a lavish plush
tarang carpet.  However, upon closer inspection, you notice that the
trademark mop and bucket in the corner, various bars of seashore scrubbing
shells lined up on the fireplace mantle, and a number of sea sponges,
collected from the Thesdian seaboard.  You realize now that these are the
quarters of the castle's Avanso, the head maid of Castle Dunluce.

The Chambers of Lana~
This room is filthy.  Especially made more so by the realization that
this is the room of Lana, the assistant Avanso, the head janitor of the
castle.  Don't laugh, it's an important position in Thesdian society, its
very matriarchal you know.  In any case, spilled water has dried in the
center of the room, leaving an ugly discolored stain in the center of the
once ivory colored carpet.  Ants and maggots crawl and lie about the room. 
But what catches your eye is the decaying corpse of a...  Woman, lying face
down on the bed with a dagger in her back.

A rope catwalk~
You stand on a rope catwalk that connects the four battlement sides of
Castle Dunluce.  The catwalk looks fairly sturdy, as it has been reinforced
by steel bolts running through the wood at frequent intervals.  A stone
platform somehow is suspended in the center of the catwalk system a short
distance above that is a taller turret, aglow in brilliant light.  It's too
bad you can't get to that turret.

A connecting bridge~
You stand precariously hanging over a massive chasm that has somehow been
dug out of the center of Castle Dunluce without reducing its structural
integrity.  It is discomforting, but you realize that you cannot see the
bottom of this chasm.  Small rope guidings have been placed up on either
side of the bridge, necessary tools to aid your crossing of this wood plank,
swaying bridge.

A connecting bridge~
You stand on a thin bridge that is constructed of parallel wooden planks
that have been tied together using a thick, and coarse rope.  Thin rope
railings line the bridge to either side, giving you some small measure of
guidance.  However, if you wanted to go through those guidings, it looks
like it would be easy enough to do.

The Star Chamber~
As you walk into this chamber, you are blinded by a dazzling, brilliant
white light flooding in from the glass paneled ceiling and refocused from a
large, sharply cut diamond gem centered in the chamber roof.  The floor here
is also clear and through it, you can view the granite floor far below. 
It's impossible to look up, blindness might await.  However, through
squinted eyes, you can view the rest of the room, plain granite walls.

This room is a clutter of cloth, dice, and a mass of papers, stewn over a
variety of ornate, but somewhat run-down mahogany furniture.  Garish looking
clothing hangs limply from wooden pegs around the walls, and half eaten food
festers in their containers, waiting to be cleaned up.  A deck of cards has
been enlarged, and pasted up onto the walls the only decor of the walls
themselves.

This room's north wall is a series of intricately connected glass panels
that offer you a breathtaking view of the city proper of Thesden to the
`inorth`l.  From this perspective, you realize the distance that you have
ascended inside the castle.  The citizens of Thesden, walking on the streets
below, appear as small insects crawling to their home. The east and west
walls are plain, polished granite and the south wall is dominated by a
large, whitewashed oaken door with a black steel handle shaped like a
crescent roll. Leading down a roughly carved hole in the granite floor is
a rough looking ladder.

The House of Korin~
This room is well furnished with a variety of desks, bureaus, and a
curtained bed resting at the northeast corner of the room.  The walls are
covered with heavy, red, velvety drapes and a few portraits of the resident
of this room.  He is a pasty faced, pale looking young man, wearing a
tightly fitting green coat and carrying a lute strapped across his back.  A
bear skin rug, a set of dice sitting on a coffee table, and a deck of cards
on the desk tell you that this Lord is one for free living and carousing.

The House of Baron~
These quarters are obviously those of a Lord of Thesden, with its lavish
gold furnishings and gilt ivory wall tapestry frames.  The intricately woven
tapestries depict the crucifixion of a man, tied up and bleeding in the
midday sun, ravens pecking at his eyeballs and his mouth open and contorted
in pain.  Not a pretty picture to be sure, but one of the defining
characteristic of this man is certainly represented.

A light passageway~
This is a brightly lit passageway that seems to runn east and south.  You
aren't sure about that because the bends are very slight yet very distinct
at the same time.  Perhaps that has to do with the light reflecting off the
granite of the walls.  In any case, an immaculatly clean white carpet covers
the center ten fet of the fifteen foot wide hallway here.  Double the usual
amount of lanterns have been placed here as well, giving you the feeling
that this place is sacrosanct, a holy place.

thirds of the hallway.  The carpet is so clean and so bright that it makes
you feel guilty to walk on its surface.  Remarkably, your feet leave no
stains on the fur, dirt magically rubbing off its soft surface before it has
a chance to settle.

probably explains the steel bars you can see poking down from the ceiling on
either side of you that can be made to drop at a moment's notice.

The passageway runs east to west here.  The most noteworthy part of this
hallway is that an immaculate white carpet (fur?)  Covers the floor here,
blanketing the center two thirds of the passageway.  The granite walls have

along the walls, and the closed wooden door that stands majestically to the
north.

cleanliness of the carpet makes you feel guilty about walking on its
hallowed surface, but there is precious little space to walk on, so you will
just have to deal with the guilt that you feel for treading on the
immaculate.

lies beyond, something that is not at all familiar to Castle Dunluce.

You have entered a manificent chamber, with high, vaulted, frescoed

here is that crystal clumps magically grow out of the granite floor here. 
Various shades of blue, clear, and pink reflect and capture the light that
bounces throughout the room, sending splashes of color bouncing off the
walls and your eyes.  Creeping ivy partically obscures the door to the west
of you and lie in brambles at its base.

beneath your feet.  Shades of pink, blue and white are visible here,

face and the rest of the chamber.

Creeping vines lace their way gracefully up the edges of the doorway,
seemingly aware of the asthetic role that they play.

below here is an intimidating addition to the vista, a reminder at how damn
high you really are.

glints off the facets of these crystal shards, sending beams of blue and
clear light dancing through the air.

`oWhite...  Light...  Floods through the air here.  The ceilings and
marble of the floor fade into hexagonal blurs, purely peripheral in your
vision.  More than the crystal clear fountain here, or the crystalized ring
of stone, arranged in a circle centered about the fountain you feel a sense
of inner peace here, as if you devoid yourself of all emotions, and have
been left with not what you can be, and not with what you are, but what you
WANT to be.  Hanging from the center of the ceiling, directly above the
fountain is a golden rope, tight and silky to the touch.  It disappears into
the light above, destination unknown.  ``

This is the eastern section of the Crystal Glade.  A granite wall bars
the way to the east, although granite has long been painted over by artistic
murals.  The ceiling is barely visible from this distance, but what you can
make out is a marvel in architecture.  Beams arch across the ceiling,
interleaved with fantastic frescoes of past heroes of Thesden.  Crystal
sprouts all about your feet, forming pathways through which you can walk and
explore the rest of the Glade.

A Crystal Glade~
You find yourself tucked into a corner of the Crystal Glade here, with
pathways leading north and east through the pink and blue crystals.  The
ceiling is a bit closer to the ground here than in the center of the Glade,
perhaps thats because the ceiling slopes down into each corner.  In any
case, it is still very high, and you are hard pressed to make out the
intricate frescoes that have been placed on the vaulted ceiling.

The Southern Glade~
You stand at the southern end of the Crystal Glade, an end and a
beginning of sorts.  Paths lead through the man height crystals sprouting
from the granite that allow you to head north, east, and west.  A massive
doorway fashioned from gilt ivory and gold bars the way to the south.  Light
refracts and reflects through the entire chamber, sending beams of arcing
color to every corner.

A Crystal Glade~
The Crystal Glade is blocked off in two directions here, south and east
by granite walls that are decorated with paintings and murals.  Paths cut
through the seemingly sporadic clumps of crystal on the ground here,
allowing you to head in the other two cardinal directions.  The very
symmetry of the Glade you have seen so far makes you want to believe that
this entire structure is man made people would be hard pressed to argue with
you.

A dank, dim corridor~
The brass trimmed doorway behind you, you find yourself in a dark, dank
corridor that bends to the south and east here.  The lights here seem to
have lost the magic that was once instilled in them, making them but a
shadowed husk of their former selves.  To the south stands a massive brass
door.

A dank, dim corridor~
The flickering lights in this section of the corridor lay testament to
the fact that the magic of this part of Castle Dunluce has weakened in
recent times.  You are not sure why, especially with the resurgence in local
magicdom.  The corridor here is dim, you think you can make out the
beginning of a staircase a little ways to the south though.

The House of Arioch~
By the look of the furnishings and decor in this room, these are the
quarters of one of the Lords of Thesden.  The room is rather plain as far as
Lords' chambers go, a few not so brilliantly woven tapestries, thick plush
carpeting and furniture that looks as if it were cut and finished just
yesterday.  The room has a slightly tangy smell to it, as if it has been
cleaned out recently.

A secluded corridor~
Somehow, you have managed to stumble upon yet another hallway in Castle
Dunluce.  Hexagonal shutters made from the deepest, blackest obsidian frame
each lantern here, casting a somewhat dim and impure light across the length
of the hallway.  Following in the theme of darkness, the tapestries and
carpet are a matching tone of deep blood red.  Amidst the hangins are doors
that lead to the east, west, and a silver door that leads off to the north.

The House of Altara~
This room is clearly that of a well financed woman.  Beautiful, ornate
gowns fit for any feast day hang frominside a large, walk in wardrobe. 
Every little item has been neatly put in its place, from the tiniest powder
puff to the canopied bed on the far wall of the room.  A large door
decorated with lace and gemstones graces the west wall here as well.

Before brass trimmed door~
The short, dim corridor comes to an end here in the face of a massive
brass door.  Intricately carved brass crawls across the face of the door in
the form of ivy and leaves.  No keyhole or doorknob is visible.  You've
probably gotten used to no handle/no knob doors by now, and know how to open
them with ease.

A darkened staircase~
You stand at the base of a staircase that leads straight up through the
darkness.  Either the lanterns here have gone out, or they were never lit in
the first place.  Of course, that is a pretty foolish proposition, why would
they place lanterns here if they were to be never lit?  Doesn't quite make
sense does it?

You stand in the chambers of a noble woman, resplendent in tapestries and
fine articles of clothing.  Newly varnished furniture lines the walls of the
room, a room smelling of newly cleansed wool, expensive perfumes made from
fruit peels, and the ripe delicious smell of newly baked tarts.

A secluded corridor~
The corridor here is dark and lined with tapestries and carpet.  As you
sniff the air, you can detect the faint smells of saltwater and sealife in
the air, mingled in with the more artificial smell of sprayed on musk.  The
salty smell is probably carried by the breeze that you can feel wafting in
from the south, through vents that you fail to see.

The House of Daran~
This room is starkly decorated in the true fashion of a warrior.  Swords
hang on the wall, criss crossed in front of well polished crested shields. 
Unfortunately, they are bolted solidly to the wall, deterring any would be
thief such as yourself.  Solid, bold blues and golds are the dominant colors
here, from the bed comforter, to the curtains hanging along the walls.  A
wardrobe and desk are the only other pieces of furniture in the room.

A short, dim corridor~
This is a short, dimly lit corridor, that forks to the north and east
here.  It's not a real fork of course, just a turn, but it's near dinner
time, so cooking utensils are frequently substituted in for common words. 
The walls and floor are unadorned here, althought you can make out a large,
glinting door to the north and a staircase leading down, to the east.

The golden staircase~
You stand at the top of a staircase that glitters of gold and sparkling,
something, inlaid in it.  Flaming torches that give off no heat line the
staircase and cause all that much more sparkle.  Somehow, the staircase
seems even brighter than the illumination the torches give off.  Perhaps it
is the reflection of the metallic surface, or maybe just the exultation in
your mind from minding another way upwards in Castle Dunluce.

The hall of mirrors~
Everywhere, everywhere, everywhere you look, you see yourself staring
back at you.  Mirrors have been set up at all angles and in a multitude of
layers, making it almost impossible to get your bearings.  You immediately
lend credence to this statement when you smash your face against a polished
surface in front of you.  The mirror quivers a bit, but it appears sturdy,
awash with the glow of forgotten magic.  As you look around, you're not even
sure you can find your way back...

The Chambers of Teodecki~
This is a high ceilinged, extremely large chamber, decorated with an
unseeing eye and arranged with an untidy hand.  A large, canopied bed rests
against the west wall, its translucent drapes torn from disuse.  A small
marble fountain bubbles forth along the base of the room, while terraced
steps lead up to the bed and a night table.  A figure of a man, a dummy,
stands suspended froma thick hemp rope.  It is clad in chain mail and marred
from hours and hours of sword and staff practice.  A ten by ten portrait of
a man hangs above the fireplace on the east wall.  His sallow eyes and
trimmed goatee mark him as a man to be reckoned with.

The western battlements~
The western battlements overlook Colwyn Bay here, a magnificent body of
water that gleams in the light.  You can also see the city of Thesden gently
rolled up against the Bay, its population busy in their struggle at day to
day life.  The cliff that Castle Dunluce is situated on drops off to the
water level here, a precipitous drop that leaves you wondering why their are
battlements on this side of the wall at all.

You stand in a room, perfectly symmetrical and tidily well kept.  Your
feet rest on a thick crimson red carpet that extends from wall to wall. 
Resting on a polished wooden tripod in each corner of the room is a large
glove, glowing like a moon and illuminating the room.  Red carpet,
embroidered with gold leaf, also covers the walls, held flat and tight with
long brass rods that extend the length of the room.  A grandiose chandelier
hangs from the domelike ceiling, sparkling and spreading it light to the
corners of the room.  To the north is a beautiful carved wooden door.

The southern battlements~
You stand on the southern battlements, what seems to be a hundred leagues
above the water surface that you can see far below.  In fact, you wonder why
the castle even needs southern battlements.  It would be pretty damn hard to
scale several hundred yards of sheer and handleless cliff to reach the walls
of the castle.  Drop a few rocks on them and they would never make it up.

open up into a larger, more sumptuous chamber.  As it is, you probably
cannot fit more than ten people in this room.  To the south stands a solid
looking, gold-trimmed oaken door.

smell of salt water is evident in the air here, a clear crisp odor that
permeates your nose and head.

A tiled walkway~
The floors here have been tiled into an ornate mosaic pattern, stlized
into a long sinuous cresent moon.  But it is not the expensive looking tile
that catches your eye, its the lack of walls in this hallway.  Both to the
east and west, instead of the customary harsh granite of the castle, you see
just empty blackness.  As you cautiously peek over the edge of the walkway,
the expectant level below is not there, replaced by a similar darkness.  The
walkway continues to the south, and a gold worked oaken door stands to the
north.

A tiled walkway~
The hall without walls continues south here.  You feel a certain sense of
discomfort as you tread upon the intricate mosaics.  The emptiness to the
sides of you is gaping, a yawning chasm that you don't want to think about
too much.  A black wooden door stands to the east here, somehow suspended
against a background of nothingness.  As you peek around the edge of the
door (as if you expected it) there is nothing.

material, stylized to form the triple crescent moon symbol of Thesden.  The
most eye catching oddity here is, howeber, the lack of granite walls that
customarily surround the passageways.  It almost appears as if the tiled
walkway is suspended over thin air!

It is the notable lack of walls .  When you look where the grey granite
should be, you see only black emptiness.  To the south, a scarlet hued door
stands, seemingly two dimensional among the backdrop of black.

ground.

green covers the floor from wall to wall here, and well polished tripods
stand in the corners of the room.  A glowing ball, roughly fifteen feet in
diameter rests on the tripods, providing much of the light in this room. 
The walls have been fashioned into a beautiful golden scale motif, with
metal leaf being pounded into an overlapping plate pattern.  The light
glints off the scales on the walls, giving the room a sparkling ambience.

The Chambers of Carlomin~
When you walk into this room, it hardly seems to be the abode of a High
Lord of Thesden.  If anything, it looks more like the library at the local
city hall than anything else.  Of course, the collection here is much more
extensive.  Stacks of papers and dog eared books mark the quarters of
Carlomin, one of the more intellectual of the High Lords.  A small bubbling
brook courses and meanders across the lower terraced part of the room,
weaving in between lamps, books, and furniture.

The Overlook~
You emerge from the hall of mirrors and find yourself before the most
maginificent view that you have ever seen.  You stand high up on the
cliffside, in the middle of the cliff to be exact, overlooking the grand
ocean that sprawls out to the south and east of you.  The surf of the ocean
crashes up against the rocks below, sending audible creaking noises up the
side of the cliff.  Birds fly lazily above the waters, seemingly content in
their realization that they are free animals, alive and vibrant.

You find yourself inside a small closet, a dingy little room that is
lined with shelves and filled with a variety of crates and boxes.  Most of
the substances that you find on the shelves consist of bottles and fluids,
cleaning materials perhaps.  Unfortunately, you can't tell what is in the
crates, they're locked and very very sturdy.

Inside the azure pool~
You crash through the glass panel that covers the top of the pool and
find yourself swimming in a fluid that reminds you of the amniotic fluid of
mammals.  It is viscous, and too warm, leaving you with one of those
uncomfortable feelings of nausea.  Blue light filters down through the
surface of the pool, its illumination refracting and bending through the
thick medium.  It is difficult to see in this pool, and completely
impossible to breathe.  Out of the corner of your eye, you see a regenerated
glass shield slide back into place at the surface of the pool, trapping you
inside!

`k[`j+ `cThe Honor of Marchment `j+`k]``~
You stand in a brilliantly decorated chamber with a wide myriad of flora
dotted about the room.  Mirrors cover the high ceiling and many of the
walls, and a thick blue carpet graces the floor.  A massive canopied bed
rests against the far wall, easily big enough for five people.  Paintings
hang in frames all about the room, suspended from thing wires reaching up to
the ceiling, and with a drawing on either side, so the frame is put to its
full use.

You stand in a circular room, dominated by a deep red circular table in
its center.  Arranged about the table are high backed chairs, pushed away
from the table just far enough to allow a person to sit down.  Banners from
various nations are artfully arranged the perfectly polished granite, and a
door stands against the northern arc of wall.

A meeting room~
This is an oval shaped room that is sumptuously decorated with rugs,
carpets, and ornamental entrappings.  In contrast to the shape of the room,
a rectangular table sits in its center, surrounded by leather backed chairs.
To the south, there is an oaken door, and to the north is a doorway opening
that leads into a circular room, giving you the impression that this little
portion of the stone is shaped like a snowman.

The southeast turret~
You stand on top of one of the towers of Castle Dunluce.  It is an amzing
view that you are afforded here, eclipsed only by the battlements that poke
their heads into your line of sight every few feet.  Even then, those
battlements have arrow slits cut into them.  A banner with the crescent moon
symbol of Thesden ripples softly in the wind here, held up by a brass pole
that has been treated for protection against the weather.

a cluster of glowbulbs hanging from the walls.  The room itself is a small
square, with uncomfortable looking chairs lined about the walls.  A
receptionist's desk stands just to the right of a large oaken door, closed
to the public.  Cheap looking paintings adorn the walls, giving you the
impression that you are in a waiting room (check room name).

however, into what you could best term as a rainbow.  It would be hard to

and dances through your head.

The Rainbow Court~
You have entered a massive columned chamber that sparkles with a myriad
of colors that arc across the slanted ceiling of the room.  A vibrant series
of reds, blues, and other colors seem to originate somewhere on the sides of
the chamber, projecting upwards until they meet at the very apex of the
room.  The gold and silver and other precious gems seem to lose their own
identity in this room, instead replaced by the hues which have been
projected upon them by the color pattern.  A rainbow carpet leads to the
south, somehow pleasant in appearance and texture.

dominated by the red part of the spectrum.  A small throne rests in the
corner here, adorned with rubies and garnet stones.  The carpet here is red
as well, the color of the deepest firesun.  A number of liveried servants
pace about here, maintaining their position in this sub court of the royal
court of Thesden.

The Rainbow Court~

of composing spectrums.  The carpet underneath your feet gives unwillingly
underneath your feet as if it has a stubborn mind of its own.  The high
ceilings are marked by the projections of colorful lights that merge at the
very top to form a brilliant white light.  And you thought your high school
physical science class would never come in handy...

throne encrusted in the finest emeralds sparkling with a thousand facets
rests in the center here.  A long green carpet path leads away from the
rainbow path and leads up to that throne.  Banners and flags line that path,
forming a shaded walkway for visitors to walk upon.  Green light floods up
from behind the throne to meet the sparkling color mixtures high up above.

and encrusted with mandarinian jewels that sparkle with the power of a
thousand suns.  An orange carpet path leads off to the east where it joins
shortly with the central rainbow carpet.  Behind the justice's throne, a
bright light projects upwards onto granite ceiling, where it mingles with
the other colored projections high up above.

The Rainbow Court~
The rainbow hued carpet that you have been treading on comes to an end a
short ways to the south of here, in the form of a throne that is encrusted
in a myriad of colored gems.  For a more complete description, you'll have
to type south and go see for yourself.  Rainbow colors project up towards
the ceiling of the massive chamber from behind obstructions at the sides of
the room.  They follow the gentle slope of the walls and arc up to meet at
the crown pins of granite.  Smaller thrones, artwork, and a multitude of
banners and flags also dot the room, a veritable parade of sensory input for
you to devour.

Tribunal.  A throne made of solid gold and platinum, encrusted in a bed of
sapphires rests against the east wall here, resplendent in the light that
cascades down upon its arms and legs.  A thick blue carpet leads away to the
west where you can see where it intersects with the rainbow carpet in the
chamber's center.  Banners and flags also line the pathway.  A brilliant
blue glow emanates from somewhere behind the throne, arching gracefully up
into the sky to meet the other colors in the ceiling.

dedicate to the subcourt of the yellow spectrum.  A beautiful throne crafted
from gold and silver and stapled with bits of amber rests against the west
wall here, at the end of a brilliantly vibrant yellow carpet that leads away
to the east and the Rainbow Tribunal.  The Yellow Court's proximity to the
Rainbow Tribunal has nothing to do with the relative importance of the
subcourt, its just there.

The Rainbow Tribunal~
You stand at the southern end of the Rainbow Court, at the very seat of
power in all of Thesden, the Rainbow Tribunal.  It is here that the Lord
Justices of Thesden meet to decide on country policy, law, and structure. 
It is not to say that they hold absolute power of course, but the entire
scene radiates a majesty that is beyond that of any normal gathering.  A
massive golden throne encrusted in a wide variety of gems rests against the
south wall here, in the center of a long fifty foot desk that spans to the
east and west.  Chairs have been placed at the desk, seats for Lord Justices
presumably.  A large tripod with glowing embers in it rests at the point of
a crescent moon symbol that has been tiled into the ground here.  Its
purpose is unknown, but it adds a somewhat primitive flavor to the
magnificence of this chamber.

finest platinum and silver rests against the east wall, embedded with
amethyst chunks the size of your head.  A brilliant violet light flares out
from behind the throne, reaching high up into the sky and merging with the
other chromatics in a flare of white light at the chamber's peak.

The Prism~
You enter a chamber that is awash in a blinding light.  Illumination
cascades down from above, and focuses down into a brilliant gem that rotates
slowly in midair here.  It is cut in cubic shapes, and angled against the
incoming light beams.  Brilliant rays of color emerge from the massive
diamond, spraying themselves across the walls and through holes in the
room's walls.  In case you haven't figured it out by now, this room supplies
both the beams of light you have seen in the Rainbow Court, and the
brilliant light that floods some sections of the lower levels.  Through the
blinding light, you can make out a thin, chain link ladder that leads the
way up.

The Crown of Thesden~
You have emerged from the top of Castle Dunluce.  This particular spot is
known to the nobility as the Crown of Thesden, probably because only royalty
are afforded the chance to stand here.  Looking all about, you can make out
the four towers of Castle Dunluce, the city of Thesden itself, and the
brilliant ocean that spreads out to the south and east.  A small platform is
a short jump down from here, it connects to a series of rope and stone
catwalks that connect the towers and the battlements of the castle.

A cross walk platform~
You stand on a floating stone platform that hovers in the air here.  It
is the hub of a series of rope catwalks that stretch off to the castle's
battlements in all four cardinal directions.  You can barely make out the
view from each direction here, as the platform is slightly depressed
relative to the battlements themselves.  In any case, the rope catwalks
appear fairly sturdy, partially because of the steel pins that have been
added to the wooden floor boards.

upwards in the tower, up into the exterior defensive network of Castle

castle are a tad less advanced magically than the castle itself.

You open the door exiting the tower and discover yourself standing on
air!  It isn't just an illusion this time either, as you find yourself
falling and falling and falling, uh oh!  SPLAT!  You find yourself in
excruciating pain as your bones slam against the rocky shore below Castle
Dunluce at five hundred miles an hour.  If you could be dead in a mud, you
would be dead right now, but fortunately you have been given another lease
on life, and will be allowed to explore from this point.  A massive ocean
spreads off to the south here, as well as to the west and wherever you look.
