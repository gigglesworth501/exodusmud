baker elf Kiiblieraelf~
Kiiblieraelf~
The baker arranges eclairs until he feels you are properly desperate.
~
Kiiblieraelf is probably the best baker in the world, a fact that he is
well aware of, and it shows in his bearing.  Although the baker is
uncommonly short for an elf, he still carries himself with self confidence. 
Flour dots his nose, the same white as his hair, and a benevolent smile
touches his lips as he creates yet another masterpiece of the culinary art.

An elven grandma~
A little old elven lady happily knits a paisley doily here.
~
This cute little old lady smiles at you sweetly, probably mistaking you
for one of her grandchildren.  Waving cheerfully, she shows you the paisley
monstrosity of a scarf that she is knitting.  She makes you want to wipe
your feet and wash behind your ears.

momma elf woman~
An elven mother~
A frazzled elven mother straightens up behind her hyperactive child here.
~
She glances up at you before looking for her child with anxious blue
eyes.  She is a quite lovely elf, slim and graceful like most of her race. 
Motherhood has tired her out though, and an elf who once danced through the
night now falls asleep most of the time after nine.  She is also an
excellent housekeeper.  Before having her child, she was a lawyer as well,
but now she is raising her child for a few years.

brat elf boy~
A hyperactive brat~
A hyperactive little elven brat plays here...and there....and there...
~
This little monster tears all around the room.  He's a cute child, with
his mom's pretty blue eyes, but he can't sit still for a minute.  Despite
his mother's best efforts, he has a smudge of dirt on his upturned nose and
his hair is standing up.  He grins up at you evilly, and looks like he is
considering biting you.  The smug grin on the little brat's face implies
that he has just done something bad, like stolen his mother's money.

A huge, mutant frog~
A huge, mutant frog with glowing `lblue`` `ueyes attacks you with his tongue!``
~
Ugh!  Someone's magical experiment obviously went wrong at some point,
and the result not only survived, but has grown into full monstrosity.  This
huge green frog has blue eyes that glare intelligently around, fangs, and a
purple tail.  Whatever happened, it just looks mean and hungry.

A jittery elf patron~
A jittery elf tries to drink some coffee, but his hands shake too much.
~
This elf has had way too many strong, caffeine laden drinks.  His hands
shake, his eyes are bloodshot, and he twitches convulsively.  Yet he cannot
tear himself away from here and settles for spouting nonsense at everyone
who comes near him.  He would smile, but he needs another cup now.

A pretty elven maiden giggles here with her friends.

This elf maid looks up at you with bright, innocent eyes and then looks
at her friends and giggles.  She's a very pretty little thing, will probably
be even prettier when she is older, but it looks like all she does is
giggle.  The girl sees you looking at her and she tosses her hair over one
shoulder while giving her friends a significant look.

The syvin man~
A handsome syvin man is curled up on the bedroll, lazily resting.
~
Firlen's hair is tousled and his garments are rough.  His manners are
those of one who is unused to societal niceties.  He is visiting family in
the elven city, probably shipped off to them by exasperated family at home. 
He looks like the kind of man that lives with his mother though full grown. 
His blue eyes are warm and friendly though (when open) and his demeanor
genial.

An almost dead battered mockup of a knight on horseback is here to practice on.

Composed of wood and stuffed with what looks like dried plants, the
listing dummy is a rough mockup of a knight on horseback.  It holds a
twisted stick in front of it like a jousting pole, and sits haphazardly on
its faithful stuffed mount.  Someone has drawn a mustache on the mount.

An egotistical paladin puffs out his chest to try to impress the world here.

A boy stands before you in paladin gear.  He is human in an elven city,
but still thinks he is the most beautiful thing on the planet, despite the
fact that the elven city is probably the place where this mediocre boy looks
at his worst.  His gear has been polished to a mirror sheen, but looks
useless.  His eyes cross as he tries to look at himself in his armor.  In
his self-worship, he has forgotten his god and is now an anti-paladin.

A sea gull~
A white and grey sea gull calls out searchingly.
~
Long white wings stretch out and away from the grey bridles on the back
of the gull.  Ancient elven legends claim that the sea gull was once a man
who tried to enslave a god, and was turned into a gull for his presumption,
the magic bridle he had used forever marked onto his back.  This specimen of
the gull race looks none too noble...  Or intelligent...

Her eyes, oh her eyes....  She seems to see through you, not even
noticing you, but the expression in her eyes, the sorrow, thought, and
regret, that you will carry with you as you go about the world.  Her lovely
face will not be remembered, nor her flowing lustrous hair or graceful,
slender form, but her eyes...  Those will haunt your dreams.

Lindontiris the wandman~
An extraordinarily tall and thin man carefully arranges his stock.

Sometimes people are driven insane by circumstances.  Sometimes people
are born insane.  The wandman is neither.  He quietly went insane one day,
and ever since then, has been convinced that every wand has its own soul and
personality.  His insanity is harmless, and his wands are quality, so nobody
in town bothers him about it.  He's happy with his wands (and says they are
happy with him too).

Elytenithian looks up at you with blue, blue eyes that are as wide and
innocent as a rock is hard.  There is something unsettling about him,
something ungentle in him that speaks to a madness within your soul and
makes it stir restlessly.  A hat is jammed down over his head so far it
makes his ears stick out, almost comically.  He is not someone you want to
laugh at though...

Garbed in a threadbare dress, the healer is a thin human woman with long
dark hair.  She waits here faithfully for the elven warrior she loves,
though it has been over a decade since she last saw or heard anything of
him.  Her eyes bear the sorrow of her waiting, but she speaks little and
moves quietly in her healing.  She seems to draw her strength from the hope
that he will someday return to her.

Sir Gatewyin~
The warrior teacher waits here restlessly, darting glances to the hospital now and again.
~
Gatewyin was once the most famous of elven warriors.  He retired
mysteriously while still in his prime fighting years, and now trains the few
warriors who come to the elven city.  His brown eyes hold sorrow, though. 
He is the first to tell you he is a fool, however, for he loves the woman, a
HUMAN even, who loves his long-disappeared best friend.  He hopes that
someday, Keriona will notice him...  And begin thinking of him, instead of
his friend.

Rhylindhea the priestess~
A priestess floats in mid-air, sitting calmly cross-legged.
~
Clad in soft robes of a gentle green, Rhylindhea is an elven woman of
indeterminate age.  Although she is lovely, she is impossible to think of as
anything other than a mentor.  The aura of calm that surrounds her like a
halo bespeaks a life well spent in search of truth -- and the achievement of
that goal.  She wears a headband, a rankband so simple that you almost do
not realize that she is a high priestess of the temple.

A foppishly dressed elf lounges indolently here, plucking at a lute.

Although his demeanor suggests that he is on the verge of falling asleep
from boredom, the sharpness in Talbinor's eyes leads you to believe that
perhaps he didn't get his post through family connections but earned it the
hard way.  Despite the soft life he no doubt leads as a teacher here at the
Bardic Guild, he is dressed, though foppishly, in clothing that looks
altogether serviceable and could be changed at a moment's notice...

This child of the streets looks back at you with eyes that were probably
never innocent, and spits in the street.  His hair is hidden under a

listlessly.  For him, hope is a word that you use to hurt others by
reminding them how hopeless life is.

This little one looks at you with eyes that are too old in her young
face.  She probably never got the chance to be innocent before she had to
learn to survive the harsher section of town.  Her defensive, crouching pose
indicates a willingness to flee immediately, and her hands are flexed
slightly, as if in preparation for a fight.  She is still too young to have
given up completely, even though she knows what she will probably be forced
to turn to when she gets older.

The Revered Galwylym~
The Revered Galwylym waits here, his compassionate eyes alight with his faith.
~
Although his eyes are sad, Sir Galwylym smiles at you benevolently.  His
brow is lined with years of honorable battles against the evil that walks
the realms, and as he began to age, he decided to become the trainer of the
young elven clerics.  His biggest concern is the low number of those young
clerics, and he fears that an insiduous evil may be eating at Ilewyen... 
And that there may be no clerics left to fight it.  Ilewyen gossip has it
that he was a great warrior, but one morning he was found curled at the feet
of the statue in the Ilewyen cathedral, and has been the holiest of clerics
ever since.

guest fat woman~
The guest~
A fat woman mercilessly picks on everything she sees.
~
This short, fat human woman looks out of place among all these elves. 
She sneers disdainfully at you as you look at her.  This guest is here for a
reason-- to make the lives of the debutantes miserable by constantly not
allowing them to dance with the young man of their choice.  Unfortunately
for the young men, she thinks that the best way to do this is by seducing
the young men...  At this point, many of the young elven males run when her
old face begins to contort in their direction.

A pretty debutante~
A pretty debutante dances gaily with her admirers.
~
Twirling one lustrous curl around her finger, this young girl tries to
pretend that she is bored, but her excitement shines in her pretty eyes. 
Although she knows that her parents will probably marry her to someone for
political reasons, she is still hoping for a love match with an equally
attractive, wealthy, young man destined for power.

A pretty debutante~
A pretty debutante giggles as she dances gracefully.
~
Lowering one gleaming eye in a wink, this lovely noble smiles artfully
behind the shield of her fan before she whirls away.  She's managed to avoid
gettig married for at least one Season, and is enjoying the attentions of
her suitors.  The chaperones that stare menacingly along the walls will keep
anything from going too far, for she is very very rich and hence very very
marriageable.

The Lady Paladin~
The paladin teacher waits quietly here, her mind on holier things.
~
This noble and proud elven woman stands before you, holiness almost
radiating from her every pore.  The Lady is known by no other name and most
people cannot even conceive of calling her anything else.  She is the Liege
Lady of Paladins in Ilewyen and that's all they need to know.  One look from
those piercing brown eyes and suddenly the weight of their own soul is too
much to bear.  They, and you, can ask her no more.

A fierce little dwarf~
A fierce dwarf stomps along beside the liquid elves with all the grace of an elephant.
~
This dwarf stares at your fiercely, as if daring you to ask why he is
here among the elves.  A long mustache twines and curls upwards, and a long,
luxurious beard (surely an honor to his family!)  covers most of his face,
but some whispered reminder of sorrow and compassion still wanders in the
carefully schooled look of this seeming mercenary.  What drove him, and
drives him still, that he would, a dwarf (and dwarves so slow to change!) 
come so far from his southern homeland?

those who know them, they can be themselves, and are finally free.  His
eyes, light blue, sometimes drift away from the downturned head of his
companion to a passing beauty, but return always to his love.

A slim, dark-haired woman of indeterminate age, the teller is dressed
neatly but conservatively, in the manner of most bankers.  While the cloth
is quite a fine weave, the subdued blue of the dress and chaste cut make it
clear that that the teller is all business.  Dark hair hides the tips of her
ears, though her face seems slightly too round to be elven, but too angular
to be human.

A wrinkled old woman stands here holding a large, smelly basket.

A face almost lost among its wrinkles peers up at you, eyes sharp and
piercingly searching your face (and the intensity of that gaze upon your
purse is even worse!)  .  Strands of silver-grey hair hangs stringily down
over her weathered old face.  She spends her day here selling fish and
arguing with the elderly Canthi woman who lives in the river here.  Although
she would never admit it, she rather enjoys badgering and being badgered by
the other woman.  She finds the joke that they sound like fish wives
hilarious.

An unbelievably perfect elven woman looks like she is trying to hide her boredom.
~
Twisting one silky curl petulantly around one perfect finger, a
shockingly beautiful woman looks at you with a sultry gaze calculated to
make your blood boil and your jaw drop.  She flows from one flattering pose
to another, showing off sensual curves draped seductively in expensive
silks.  Rings glitter on her fingers, and as she toys with her curl, you
realize that her eyes are as cold and dead as the expensive gems she has
adorned herself with.

low cut blouse that leaves little to the imagination, and a skirt that falls
half-way down her stubby legs.  She tosses a long braid of grey hair over

A drunken dwarf~
A dwarf with a long, grey beard shouts for another drink!
~
Pounding an empty mug on the table and waving another mug in his other
hand, this dwarf is obviously thirsty and wonders what is taking those lazy
barmaids so long to bring him more to drink!  Never mind that both mugs have
been refilled as fast as the women can get to him, he still isn't satisfied.
Although his eyes are slightly brightened from the wine, and his bulbous
nose is quite red, he seems to be a happy grump.  His long grey beard is a
little disheveled and smells of cheap beer.  No matter how friendly he
looks, you note the big axe at his side and decide not to mention any
apparent flaws in his appearence or deportment.

Tall and lithe, this elven miss is the opposite of her stubby dwarven
coworker.  She flirts shamelessly with the customers and seems obviously
more interested in that than in her job.  Her blouse is not quite as low-cut
as the other barmaid's, perhaps because she is not as well endowed, but her
skirt has been hiked up almost to the point of indecency.

lives for mischief...  And the chance to loot the unwary.

Glaring into his deep black cold eyes, you can almost see your own
reflection bouncing back to you.  He has long blue hair, and soft, pale skin
that has burn marks from his encounters with Lavos and his minions.  His
hand holds a staff of Time and in his other hand he holds a crystal ball,
silky silver and shining in the light.  He sends a stern half-bent smile
towards you, greeting you with a ceremonious tip of his long pointed hat. 
As you look again, trying to decipher just how old or young he is, he says a
few mumbled words and disappears into thin air.

apprentice~
Jocko~
A mischievious dwarf, dressed as an apprentice, beckons you closer.
~
A powerfully built dwarf looks at you and offers you a vial for sale. 
Judging from the scars on his strong little form, he was once a warrior, but
decided on a change of career.  His whole bearing is one of pride, and seems
to almost strut, as if proclaiming himself a Big Bad Boy Extraordinaire. 
Although he seeks to become a master mage, he is feels he deserves more than
his master pays him, and so sells vials.

Lord Brakelieran~
`mA somber young elven lord stares thoughtfully into the distance.
~
Richly but somberly clad in garments of black, this young elf lord is
surprisingly unattractive for one of his people.  His hair is long, dark,
and uncombed, hanging down over his ears and touching his shoulders most
unfashionably.  He smiles, a bit sadly, and you notice with surprise that
he's really much more attractive when he smiles, and you wish you could make
him smile more often.  Perhaps being the son of the Duke is not, as some may
have thought, the best fate in the world.

lord zoning elf ~
The Zoning Manager~
A thin elf stares dreamily upwards here.
~
A thin elf, the Lord of Zoning must either love his job or be totally
bored by it.  Right now, he is distracted by some kind of internal reverie
that makes him not even notice you gazing at him.  He languidly brushes a
hair away from his face and continues staring upwards with a look of
abstraction that makes you wonder if perhaps you would be better off to live
in his dream world?

fountain~
The fountain begins with a pool, unbelievably crystalline waters held in
a bowl-like disk of the purest snow-white marble.  The tranquil water is
disturbed only by the slow, endless fall of tear-like drops from the white
rose, haloed with a golden glow, that floats above the water.  Carving along
the lip of the fountain curls and uncurls into 'For Tylendia, lost Bard of
Ilewyen.  ' The rose opens, pauses, the tiny figure of an elven woman, no
larger than a thimble, dancing before the rose closes and hides her.

`hPK OUTSIDE OF CLANS`l Player murder outside of the realm of clans or
guilds is frowned upon in the lands of Exodus, and killing a person who is
not a/a loner or b/in a clan and c/equal to or over level 9 is illegal. 
Losing your temper because the noclan or newbie was annoying is not
considered an acceptable defense.  `iNote:`lIf you are not in a clan or are
not already marked loner, you will receive the loner distinction if you kill
somebody or attempt to steal from other players.  Other offenses that will
earn you a loner flag are charming (spell or song), sleeping, or teleporting
other players or looting their corpses.  A good rule of thumb is to only
talk to other players in the game, and not use your abilities on them unless
a/you are aiding them at their request or b/you want to become a loner. 
Spelling up group members for a battle is acceptable, but otherwise you
should not sing, pray, enspell, or in any way use your abilities to affect
other players unless they so request it.  If you are a noclan, make sure
your autoassist is mob only or you WILL retain your loner flag if you kill
another player. 
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< `lPK
`oIN A CLAN OR AS A LONER `lIf you are in a clan or are a loner, there is no
such thing as an Out of Level (OOL) kill down with the exception of newbies,
but note that if you kill someone more than 8 levels OOL, you will lose a
tremendous amount of experience - the greater the level difference, the
greater your loss.  Players grouped with you at the time of your murder will
also be punished in the same fashion, though they may or may not be able to
appeal that.  Murdering a player who is participating in an immortal run
quest is forbidden, even in times of clan war, unless otherwise directly
specified by the immortal in charge of the quest.  Attacking a player
participating in such a quest who is marked as being part of a quest group
("quest" in title) will be punished.  Use of the quest immunity to abuse
other players will result in the usual punishment plus loss of quest prizes.
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
`oNEWBIE PROTECTION`l Do NOT attack or pk any level 8 or lower, FOR ANY
REASON.  Even if the level 8 or lower is in a clan or loner, they are NOT TO
BE ATTACKED.  Noclan rules apply to even clanned or loner newbies.  If a
newbie abuses this protection, let the imms know and/or sue for
harassment.???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????? 
- ??????  `oINDIRECT PK `lKilling players using summon, aggressive monsters,
or any other indirect means is a very severe offense and punishable by
freezing, in most cases.  Because they may kill noclans or newbies, plague,
Good Vibrations, and earthquake may not be used within Thesden or any other
area designated as a starting city should there be some in the future.  No
charming (spell or song), sleeping, or teleporting, or using your abilities
on the persons or corpses of noclans or newbies in any manner other than
with the consent of the noclan or newbie. 
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
`oMultikilling`l Killing another player several times in succession without
an adequate time lapse between kills is illegal.  Typically, an adequate
time lapse means enough time for them to recover their items and
health/mana.

overview~
`n&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&
`hThere are four major categories of offense that will get you in trouble in
the Realm of Exodus.  These are enforced directly by an immortal or through
a court of law in cases when an immortal has not made a judgment on the
matter.  If you are charged with any of the following, you may hire an
attorney to defend you if it goes to court (see HELP COURTS).  While `iyou
MUST read all the rules and obey them`h they have been separated into
different sections based on the type of offense.  These categories are :
`kIllegal Player Killing (LOOK PK), Harrassment (LOOK HARRASSMENT), Cheating
(LOOK CHEATING), and Channel Abuse (LOOK CHANNEL).  `n
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%IMMORTALS%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
`hThe immortal staff is here to help maintain a quality mud.  If it is not
in direct violation of a clearly stated rule, you are expected to comply
with their request.  Not all rules are explicitly stated in this rule list,
and they may be enforcing a rule not listed here.  If you have a problem
with that request or with a punishment you have been given, discuss the
matter privately with that immortal or another immortal staff member.  Imm
staff will also listen to your ideas for change here at the mud, and you are
encouraged also to talk to player council members about proposed changes. 
If you suspect an immortal of wrongdoing, privately talk to that immortal or
another immortal about the issue.  Have some kind of proof (ie at least an
example).  Public allegations waste everyone's time.  
~
E
harrassment~
`l* DO NOT social or emote characters that have asked you to stop.  * DO
NOT lock Sidhe in combat spam.  * DO NOT send repeated tells or telepaths to
players who do not wish to speak with you.  * DO NOT continue to argue with
an immortal after they have said their judgement is final You may appeal
through the correct channels, but if you are turned down, you may not
continue to harass staff with the issue.  DO NOT social the immortal staff
without clear permission, especially not with insulting or sexually oriented
socials.  DO NOT attempt to kill them, steal from them, charm them, bardsong
or cast spells upon them without that immortal's specific permission. 
`iHarrassment based on race, creed, nationality, religion, sexual
preference, or gender of any player will be punished severely.  `lIf you are
in someone's private rooms and they ask you to leave, do so or they can
charge you with trespassing (a form of harassment) in court.  `` 
~
E
cheating~
`l* DO NOT multiplay.  You may have multiple characters, but in NO WAY
may they be on at the same time or assist one another in any way.  This
includes leaving eq or money for your alternate or summoning someone so your
alter may kill them.  * DO NOT use a client in a fashion that gives a player
an undue advantage.  Use of a client is not illegal, but the creation of
"Bots" is illegal.  * DO NOT lie to the immortal staff.  If you are found to
be lying, you will be punished.  * DO NOT abuse bugs.  If you find a bug,
report it immediately.  * DO NOT EVER mess with arena gear in any way,
shape, or form.  Wear it for the duration of your duel, do not experiment on
it.  * DO NOT store personal items in a store.  If you don't want to sell
it, don't keep it there.  * DO NOT use stores to sell or store runes.  This
can result in loss of all stock and/or deletion.  * DO NOT mask "spoofs" or
variations on a storekeeper's name while you are in that store.  This
includes both mob and player storekeepers.  Spoofs on player names are
allowed outside of this instance provided that the first two letters of the
spoof-name are different from the real name of the player.  Immortals are
not to be spoofed without their permission.  Pet names must also follow
these rules.  * Do not steal from the persons or corpses of noclans or
newbies.  This includes using charm and making them drop everything.  It is
LEGAL to steal from noclan homes, however, as there is nothing to indicate
noclan status.  If they catch you or can prove you did it, a noclan can sue
for harassment to get their stuff back.  Clanned or loner characters cannot
do so.  * DO NOT accept or ask for favors from immortals.  The immortal
staff will assist you in many ways, but they may not help in a manner that
is not available to other players.  Favors include requests for information
that would not normally be available to you, requests for experience or
equipment, requests for special reimbs of prohibited items (runes, enchants,
etc) and so on.  * DO NOT use inherent world characteristics in order to
directly kill or rob anyone.  You also may not use them to kill mobs.  * DO
NOT use character actions (such as charm) to force players to use their
player level commands, such as alias, save, etc or to change a player's
characteristics, such as align, against their will.  * DO NOT claim that
linkdead means you have their permission to do anything to them.  It
doesn't.  * If you are punished by an immortal do not attempt to evade your
punishment.  You may appeal a judgment you feel is unfair, however, if your
appeal is turned down, that is the end of the matter.  Talk to staff to find
out who to appeal to.  If you escape from the wanted flag caused by
autojailing, that is OK.  Once you are in jail, escaping is illegal.  *
Vro'ath may not group with anyone other than other Vro'ath, and evil or
neutral humans or dwarves.

the rock, flowing over the surface and pouring down the sides to gather in

`mFountain of the Rose``~
In the center of this square, a graceful rose of ivory rises upwards from
the pool of a fountain, seemingly suspended in the air.  Waters drips down
slowly, like diamond dewdrops from the petals and leaves of the flower,
falling into the still pool of water below the rose.  The soft whisper of
trees touches your ears gently from the park to the south.

`lThis section of the square almost hums with magical energy reflected
from the buildings that surround it.  The people that pass by all seem to
have the self assurance that comes with power and much finer clothing than
the inhabitants of the lower tier.  After a moment's reflection, that a
gorgeous twisting triple helix that rises to the north resolves itself not
into a sculpture, but into a building.  A tiny plaque reads, `8'Mages'
Guild'`` `lFrom `lthe south, a glow and a melodic humming come from what
looks like a white stone rose floating in mid-air.

`jNorth Glade Park Entrance``~
To the north, magic and the soft hum of the elven city going about its
daily life beckons.  All this is meaningless however, as somehow this little
bit of woods vibrates with an almost spiritual resonance.  The trees are
more alive than many of the people who have walked among them.  Somehow,
they seem to watch curiously, as a small child might stare at an adult.

`mNortheast Rose Square``~
Here you can sense magic lying heavily in the air around you as you
approach the center of the square.  Finely grained black marble wraps around
white marble in the odd, helix-like wall to your north.  Laying your hand on
the wall, you can feel something run through you like a small electric
shock, and you pull your hand away quickly.  `mRose Square`` `l continues to
the west and south.  The crowds on Llysonnmawr street can be seen to the
east.

Llysonnmawr Street~
Noting the clean streets, elaborate shops, and the nice attire of the
elves in the street, you realize that this tier must be nicer than the lower
tier.  Most of the elves pass you by with a sniff, and the few non elves
that come up here all look as if they are making deliveries or are servants.
A guard stands stiffly to your south in front of a white, open building, and
to your north is a small shop.  An ornately lettered sign declares it to be
'`kPastry Perfection` '.

Intersection of Llysonnmawr and Croesgollen Streets~
Llysonnmawr Street continues to the east towards the heart of the elven
city, and to the west towards some shops and homes.  Peeking through a
window and looking around big, white, fluffy curtains inside, to the north
you can see some people sitting at tables eating delectable looking pastries
and drinking steaming beverages.  You pull yourself away from the window
quickly before anyone can see you acting so undignified in such a nice part
of town.  Llysonnmawr Street meets Croesgollen here in a gentle, curving
intersection.

of everything else.  Aren't you a little old to be doing this?  As you pull away, a little mist covers the windows and the smudge of your nose is gone.

Pastry Perfection~
Nirvana probably smells like this shop.  This bakery is one-half of a
larger room.  The walls are painted a pale yellow, like the cream that
visibly oozes out of a warm eclair that the busy baker has placed on a plate
not too far out of reach.  Ovens line the side wall, and an L-shaped counter
separates you from the ovens and runs along the back wall.  The rest of the
bakery is filled with small tables and uncomfortable looking chairs with
well-dressed patrons scattered throughout this obviously popular place.

incredibly elaborate and tempting pastries.  The scent of hot drinks and
freshly baked pastry promises delectable delights for anyone hungry.

`mNorthwest Rose Square``~
The magic tingles at a visceral level here for even the most magically
insensitive of souls.  Nearby, sounds are created softly in nearby
activities, such as the gentle hum of music and water, and the soft murmur
of people in the streets going about their business.  White marble
intertwines with peerless black in the wall to the north, but to touch that
wall sends a sharp magical shock through the person foolish enough to grasp
at it.  The essence of the wall is undefinable, and it curves away here from
the beginning of another road.  Northwards, Gwyntycollen Street extends
towards an unseen end.

The tingle of magic still runs through your awareness here, an
undercurrent to all of your thoughts and impressions.  True magical power
must be nearby, and glancing east, you can see an enchanted rose glowing
brightly.  The square continues to the north and south, and a huge hat hangs
to the west here.  Looking at the hat, you can make out the words `i'Elyte
Hattery'`` `lin flamboyent orange stitches on the massive green hat.

through your mind slowly and then disappears.  Gold letters glow on the
window of the shop to the north, tracing out the words `k'Wands of Wonder'``
`lin a fanciful scrawl As you watch, the flowing script reforms into a
dragon, and begins alternating the name of the store with the fanciful
designs of various creatures.

Even in this small, quiet corner of the square, magic still hums through
you.  The power of the Mages' Guild to the north and the understated life of
the park to the south are just incredible, and make even this possible
sanctuary too charged to allow you to ever be fully comfortable here.  On
the wall to the east, a small rose has been scratched into the mortar.

This corner of the lovely square is perhaps the noisiest part of the
square.  Not only does the rustle of city life come from the square, but
loud voices and strange sounds can be heard coming from the south.  The
trees of a nearby park contribute to the noise with the chatty clacking of
the wind through branches.  The fey frissons of powerful magery are stronger
here.

partially walled up.

closer to the forbidden door.  The bored guards are in your way amazingly

faded here, making a person could more comfortable.  It looks as if quiet
elven homes begin ahead to the west.  This is an area a person could live in
comfortably...  If a person could ever could settle down in one place. 
Maybe someday.

Some hats are even on the floor, but their placement looks deliberate.  A
dazed looking elf looks up from the hat he is crooning to and rocking and

The gentle hum of the city touches ears softly here on this quiet street.
In contrast to the noisy Rose Square to the south, Gwyntycollen Street seems
to be a tranquil refuge.  A staircase landing is here, going up and down,
the grey stairs winding around the intertwined black and white marble of the
enormous tower to the east.  The stairs spiral up and down, descending out
of sight below street level as well as rising upwards to be lost in the
clouds surrounding the upper region of the Guild.

A deer trail starts underfoot, meandering south.  To the east, a patch of

further on, for no animal would be so noisy.  The trees here screen out much
of the light so it becomes more difficult to see.

`jA Little Deer Path``~
A tiny path is barely noticeable underfoot.  It runs to the north and
west here.  The greedy branches of a thorny raspberry bush to the east force
people to squeeze by carefully, trying to avoid its thorns.  This isn't so
much a park as a bit of forest that got misplaced into the center of a town,
and definitely not the sort of place one would take their children for a
casual walk.

Off The Beaten Path~
The ground off the little trail is disgustingly mushy, and feet sink down
with a SQUISH.  Small reeds reach out through the muck for aid, and a frog
croaks somewhere nearby.  The trees block out alot of the light here, but it
looks like there might be a small pond to the north.  A small sign states no
swimming is allowed here, and that everyone should turn back, lest they be

elven homes that are neither particularly nice or bad.  Just quiet and
respectable, probably the homes of the merchants that own the shops on this

Communion Room~
A soft pad covers the floor of this room, and the walls are glow with
their own light, seeming almost translucent.  The room is bare, save a
single small plant against the far wall upon a tiny rectangular table.  It
has been said that those who receive the blessings of the gods can actually
feel the affects in this room.

The Songbird Sot~
In all of the city, this is the finest inn.  Here many nobles, bards, and
clerics gather in their free time to drink and be merry.  Because of its
close proximity to the Bardic Guild and the Cathedral, sometimes the debate
between the Rose and Diamond factions flares up here and things become
dangerous.  You might want to keep your weapon ready, just in case.

This small gazebo is a lovely little place, with crystalline walls.  The
south end of the gazebo seems to be blocked off, and a table with a couple
of bored soldiers sit here playing cards.  They both wear small waist

paraphenalia lines the walls.  Some stuff looks like it belongs in another
kind of shop, but you get the impression that everything here was carefully
and lovingly gathered in homage to the god of money.

Paladin Courtyard~
The gates to the guild open out into this large courtyard, which seems to

countless hooves and armor-shod feet that have marched through here.  Wild
paladin squires are underfoot everywhere here, racing madly around in
wishful imitation of the graceful, experienced paladins.  A small stairwell
leads up to a quieter area, and a side entrance to the cathedral is to the
east.

Hall of Thought~
This is a worn and battered hall, hung with banners that have been placed

allow a knight to practice almost anything.  From the looks of things, this
is where knights learn the skills they need to battle evil.  The walls are
padded -- perhaps so that no one can hear the screams?

This is not a room for talking, but rather for self-examination and

Ranger's Platform~
You can see everything or nothing as you choose from here.  You can see
into the city, and watch the unknowing citizen below, or stare into the
woods that seemed to have been plucked wholesale from some woods somewhere. 
This cleverly created platform seems to be made of tree branches, so
skillfully woven together and then allowed to grow that it almost seems
natural.  This floor of tight knit branches is soft and springy under your
feet.  Probably a good place to rest, away from the disgusting crowds, here
nobody will bother you.  Here you can forget the city and return to what is
real.

Slip-sliding Away~
All right!  You are zooming through the air at an incredibly exhilerating
speed!  The second tier of the city flies beneath your feet.  You come to a
stop with a harsh jolt as you hit a large knot in the rope.  If you wanted,
you could probably let go and drop to the ground safely in front of one of
the shops of South Thorn Street, or you could just follow this to its end. 
The citizens of the city don't even notice you as they push and shove
through the crowded streets below.  Will you drop off the rope or continue
on?

Little Linden~
The soft scent of living wood hangs heavy in this room.  The rustling
leaves screen out the sounds of the city outside of this place.  It is
obviously someone's humble home, a simple living room connected to a bedroom
in the tradition of Lindon.  Someone must have been staying here recently as
a guest however, for there is a basic bedroll sloppily tossed in one corner
of the room.  A clever curtain of reeds has been pinned to one side to the
east, allowing entry to the bedroom.

with pictures or anything else, just permitted the natural qualities of the
wood and life to shine through.  A simple little bed is here, a canopy of
vines leafing over it prettily.

This small hallway leads to the practice rooms of the bards.  To the
north is a small room perfect for a duet or a solo practice, and to the
south is a larger room that could easily fit an entire chorus.  The walls of
this hallway have been painted a bright pink for some reason, and the doors
are bright blue.  A set of yellow stairs lead upwards.  Some joker has
painted a note of the scale on every step.

mind.  A brilliant flutter of wings in one cage as an occupant stretches a
bit dislodges a bit of dust.  The delicious scent of fresh flowers wafts
through a door to the north.

noble of the city, as well as wandering mages that have stopped by in the
past, all generously donated at least one book from their private
collections.  Hence the magical wisdom of the ages is accessible here...  If

Anryhdeddu chases something unseen to the north and south, intersecting
here with the bustling commerce of Gwybodaeth Street in a circle wide enough
to turn even the largest of hay carts without spilling cargo or
unnecessarily impeding traffic.  Although the people walking in this area
are largely elves, here and there the faces of other races, sometimes
startling in their blunt cut compared to the slender fey race, move along as
well.

Gwybodaeth Street~
Ilewyen sighs under the passage of time and the people that give the city
color.  Centuries have only refined the elven city, clarifying the innate
qualities that hide beneath the facade.  Oddly enough, this makes the city,
and the people within, seem no more than a vivid dream.  Even the sturdy
wooden sign for the boisterous, lively inn here, the `iDrunken Dwarf`l,`l
contributes to this feeling by the contrast with the solid, dwarven reality
it is heir to.  ``

Here the city is lovely, but it has the offhand careless beauty of the
accidental rather than the careful planning that usually goes into cities. 
It has the weary grace of a city that has seen too much in too short a time,
but the innocent strength of life seems to permeate it so that this place
looks as if it has been tempered by experience rather than scarred.  A
small, cheerful shop is to the south, a sign in the window carefully
labelling it as 'Essen Food Shoppe.  '

they disappear into clouds, not far distant to the west.  Northwards, the

Light to darkness, the twinned strands of black and white marble that
make up the massive building that towers here open around an elaborate gate
that gleams golden.  The interior of the guild is hidden completely in
shadows too thick to be natural, and the visceral tremble is almost
overwhelming.  The small, handcrafted sign that reads Guild of Mages is
posted as almost an afterthought.  The building across the way stands vacant
and empty.  Gwybodaeth continues westwards towards the scent of water, and
eastwards where it intersects Anrhydeddu.

To the east, the open doors of a small, low building offer entry for

offering succor to the poor and needy.  How sucessful the mission may be in
gaining converts is unknown, but usually a few lost souls can be seen in the
area.  Anrhydeddu Street continues north to the center of this tier, and
south to a busy area.

Anrhydeddu Street runs north and south here down to the whirling bustle
that is the south gate of this city.  The thick, high wall of the jail rises
to the east, windowless, and perfectly, terribly clean as though just built
a second ago.  Passers by hurry past with no glances at the wall, and there
seems to be an unusually high proportion of guards walking by, perhaps
because of the proximity of the jail, or perhaps because this tier is
somehow different from the upper ones.

Northwards, the hustle and bustle of a lively city beckons.  A high gate

Closely fitted cobblestones run cool underfoot.  Looking closely, an odd
pattern seems to run through the colors and shapes of the cobbles, so subtle
as to almost be missed.  Eastwards, a gallows and prison are a grisly
welcome, and westwards, a small residential area tries to ignore its less
pleasant neighbors.

Looming ominously to the north, the city jail seems large and oddly
stolid in this otherwise airy seeming city.  A heavy, thick door, so strange
here, has been propped open, and a shadowed interior hints at the ominous

Along the wall behind the gallows, a grisly rows of heads on spikes grins
down, stark testimony to the darker side of elven nature.

heads~
Along the top of the wall, grotesque heads on spikes leer down with the
decaying ruins of faces.  Race in life is impossible to tell, or
attractiveness, since flesh drips off most of them...  At the end is the
head of a young, handsome elven man, blue eyes opened wide and innocent.  He
is the exception to this, and in his case, it may have been better not to
see decay beginning, or know how young he was...  How very very young he
looks...

gallows~
Rope swings in the breezes here above a small platform, whispering
incessantly, maniacally, of death and fear.  The dying groans of the wood
platform haunt passers by with thoughts of their own mortality.  Somehow,
the idea of elves as simple creatures frolicing in the woods seems very
alien right now.

The smooth, seamless walls of the Ilewyen prison looms ominously to the
north, and the breeze carries the faint smells of dead fish and baking
bread.  A more subtle scent, that of decaying flesh, is a reminder that even
the long-lived elves die.  To the west, beyond the prison, Ilewyen brightens
into hope.  Eastwards, poverty and despair have greyed the city into a
crumbling wrack

Eteoriod here is joyless, dark with ruined hopes and the stench of
spiritual poverty.  Faded buildings and weary people both seem to stare
accusingly, in this crumbling, dismal part of the city.  The fact that even
half-ruined it still bears the loveliness of the rest of the city seems to
make the sorrow here even stronger in contrast.  Ghostly letters steal
across the board of the simple sign, `hEtoeriod Armory`l sighing out the
presence here of a shop.

Time and life have been hard on this part of town.  Etoerioed stretches
wearily east towards a square with a headless statue in it and west past a

sturdy flag of a shop here acts as a sort of handhold, a thick wooden post
with the simple sign, '`mWeapons,`l' swaying ponderously in the wind``.

Eythe'reane's Statue~
Here, the two streets sway gracefully together in a kind of weary
elegance.  While this curve is as clean as other areas of the city, it is
much more run-down and looks well used.  A few cobbles jiggle underfoot that
have been uprooted at some time in the past and returned to their proper
places by the caring hands of someone with a really boring job.  A statue
has been defaced, giving the impression that this may not be the safest area
of town.

A glowing marble statue stands here.  Someone has magically colored the

A piece of well-worn but carefully patched fabric, the material is of

Here the smooth curve of the city walls is broken by the two slender
pillars that rise to the sky and the thick, cool black gate that contrasts
against the pale walls.  Deceptively light, the Eastern Gate still gives the
impression that anyone would be hard pressed to break into the city.  In
times of peace, as now, the gate is busy with those who come and go. 
Gwybodaeth Street runs west into town, and Ailfeddwl runs from the south up
to a small cul-de-sac to the north.

While the streets are but cobbles, someone has obviously found a way to
enchant even these common stones, for no plant grows in the roadway.  No
dust rises from the cobbles to stain garments.  Someone has carelessly
spilled something on the road, and instead of soaking into the earth, it
lies in a shimmering puddle upon the surface of the dirt, slowly evaporating
into the air.  An almost invisible pattern in the cobbles forgets itself and
the simple light pattern of the word '`mLuminosity`l' on a black window is
distracting.

east, towards the forested lands, street lazily uncoiling like a sun-warmed
serpent.  An enticingly spicy smell mingles with the smell of the street and
the people that hurry along here.  Non-elven faces glimmer among the lovely,
ethereal elven ones, the contrast reminiscent of the eternal line of the
horizon, where earth and air meet but never truly meld together.  A battered
sign proclaims the presence of a small business, the `h'Pot o' Pots.  '``

Although boats are around on both sides, looking outward to the west is the

life.  The city calls from the east, with the cares and woes of life, but
here is a momentary Lethe and freedom, if only for a moment.

The antipodal black and white of the Mage Guild wall here surrenders to a
stair, grey stone with the faintest glimmer in the shadows suggesting some
sort of enchantment.  Beneath the thrumming push of bone-deep magic so close
to the home of the wizards, more ordinary scents and sights command the
attention.  Fish and water mingle with the ordinary odors of a city to drown
out any other scents, and the sounds of life demand attention over the
outwardly passive Guild.

The shrill cry of a woman hawking fish comes from the south, and
westwards is a small, unpretentious wooden building.  Behind the building,
the mighty river rushes by, the soft lull of the waters almost hiding how
very dangerous it can be when it wishes.  The docks continue to the north
and south, with the imperfect shapes of boats hovering around their edges. 
Amid the calls of gulls here, the small wooden symbol of a boat creaks as it
swings in the wind.

A wooden pier begins to the west, leading out to the great river that
flows by the city and to the sea.  The murmur of the waves is a gentle
counterpoint to the rhythmic creaking and sudden calls of the old fishmonger
who usually stands here, hawking fish to all who pass by.  Sailors come and
go here at all sorts of odd hours, so this part of the docks is rarely
empty.

this place is just overwhelming.  The shopkeeper needs a shave, his floor
needs sweeping, and the stock is tossed on various shelves and tables in
some kind of unfathomable organization.  Even the merchandise seems to be
somewhat shifty, items of high quality reposing quietly next to poor with
the unmistakeable air of having been sold under questionable
circumstances...

Weapons Shop~
A spear hangs at just the right height to be dangerous right in front of
the door, suspended from the ceiling of this little shop by some kind of
black wire, but careless people would likely cut themselves on it.  A
variety of weapons hang from the ceiling other than the spear, seemingly
tied up by anything the shopkeeper could find, twine, vine, rope, mysterious
contraptions, thread...  The owner of this establishment proudly states that
all of his wares are displayed 'without any of that tricky sneaky magic
stuff with love by hand the way the gods intended!"  It may have been safer
for patrons, especially by that precariously hung club, if magic had been
used.

Etoeriod Armory~
Shadowy shapes stand eerily motionless in the shop.  At first, it seems
that some trick of fate has trapped the customers into some kind of frozen
state and removed all of the merchandise before the realization that the
shapes are actually dummies.  New armor adorns a variety of dummies,
including a couple short, squat shapes that could only be meant to represent
dwarves in one dusty corner.

Jail~
Even the elves could not make a prison lovely.  Harsh corners jut out
where stone walls clash at a corner, and the sour smell of the inmates is
inescapable, much like the jail itself.  Incongruous in this place, a small
desk has been lovingly polished to a fine sheen, and a plant droops
cheerfully, if a bit limply, from one corner of it.  A dismal little
staircase leads downwards.

As the water closed over your head, you realize that you have just
invaded someone's home!  Smooth stone walls alternate with coral that
someone has lovingly placed in a pattern along the walls that mimics the
appearance of the ocean floor.  Small implements and clothing peek out of
large shells that rest on the riverbed.

Drunken Dwarf Hall~
Wooden planks sigh underfoot in this hall.  Small balls of light in
ornamental holders keep it well lit -- the innkeeper wants no trouble. 
Closed doors signal the presence of rooms, but, judging from the well-worn
tracks on the floor, the north and south rooms have regular occupants.  A
small `mplaque`l hangs outside of the west room, and a cunningly carved
`cpicture`l is on the east door.

A tall, graceful tree has been carved on this door, branches tangling and

Painted animals peek out from a multitude of painted trees that extend

wing across the sky, as lively as paint and a spirited (but amateur) painter
could make them.  A soft green rug covers the floor, with occasional flowers
breaking up the monotonous pattern of green.  The only furniture is a bed
and a small washstand.

Someone has made a poor attempt at giving this room a kind of meadow
theme.  Grass is painted on the wall and flowers have been painted on the
floor.  The bed, the only furniture in the room, has a quilt with inexpertly
stitched flowers on a green background.  It looks clean, at least, and the
sheets smell fresh.

Everyone here is perfectly equal, with no furniture to set them above any

of retribution, for what is said in this room is sacred.  Among warriors,
even those of the dark, this room is where all may be honored.

it has enough room for a few warriors to practice to skills at once, even
some of the mounted skills (provided everyone is careful with their mounts).
Slightly shabby, padding hangs off the walls, now almost useless after years
of neglect.  The weaponsmaster here wears old armor, but the ease in which
he moves in it lends suspicion to any thoughts that his skills are anything
but well-honed and practiced.

tongue is sticking slightly out of his mouth in his concentration as he pens
another line.  "Shalieana's eyes widen, and she smiles at her brave rescuer.
'I could never have made it out of the caves and would have died were it not
for you, kind sir...  I know of only one thing I can give that will do,' she
says softly, as her hand slowly unlaces her bodice...  The candle-maker
smiles as he...  " The shopkeeper closes the scroll up quickly and sniffs. 
Oops!  You've been caught!

pressing through the waves.  A little trapdoor leads downward to the hold of
the ship.

The shopkeeper looks up fearfully each time the door opens, checking his
shelves to make sure that nothing has been blown out of place by an errant

hanging over the table where the scrivener sits.

Crew Quarters~
Bunks line all the walls except where the door is.  While the bunks are
all regulation neat, here and there crewmembers have personalized their
particular spot.  One crewmember has a small cloth snake-doll on their bunk,
while another keeps packs of cards in a little row on the wall.  More common
though are the naughty pictures that hide at the head of almost every bed.

Captain's Quarters~
The Captain's Quarters are fairly small, but they are private and clean. 
An extra wide bunk serves as the Captain's bed, with a large trunk built
into the bottom of it for the Captain's things.  A few momentos of some
favorite ports and a hand-woven net decorate a wall, and a colorful, exotic
rug from the City of the Sun graces the floor.

Hold of the Selkie Dreamer~
Darkness spills around you and about you in this hole.  A strong fishy
odor fills the air -- this is the hold of the galleon, where the daily
catches of fish are usually stowed.  The room is quite large, running the
entire length of the ship.  You can feel the press of the water against the
hull as the ship cleaves through the waves, astonishly nimble for such a
large ship.

Mess Room~
Long tables fill this room, and strange smells drift to your nose from

neat, with typically artful elven furniture.  Here, as always, you cannot
escape the feeling of the sea moving against the boat.

Here on the aft of the ship, the deck is at its broadest, and the second
mast rises high into the sky.  While the ropes and sails do take up quite a
bit of space, there is still plenty of space to sit at the rail and stare
out into the ocean.

Mage Guild~
Darkness swirls in the room, though ornate lamps shine brightly along the
walls.  The scent of dust, spice, and something -- something darker --
titillates the imagination, and sends an uneasy shiver down susceptible
spines.  This is the domain of mages.  Every unearthly shimmer of magic
whispers a reminder of the power that this building has contained over the
ages.  Rich carpeting whispers beneath feet, and fanciful creatures leer
down from the startlingly vivid tapestries that hang the walls.

Satingan Square~
Huge platinum doors stand proudly to the east, a quicksilver movement of
electricity chasing across it.  Two glowing balls of light float quietly on
either side of the door, and a small, `kgolden plaque`l speaks out against
the silver backdrop of the door.  Magic emanates from the doors, from the
entire structure of the Mages' Guild, each strange, twisting strand of color
almost pulsing like a heartbeat.  Here, on the tier of the noble, it seems
to shine and reflect off the many fine buildings that surround it,
contrasting magic and wealth and posing a silent question.  ``

Pendefigaeth Street~
The soft murmur of the small square to the east drifts gently on the
breezes to ears here.  Pendefigaeth Street runs north and south here,
curving out of sight in the distance.  The people that pass seem to all be
richly dressed, either in the ornate and luxurious clothing of the elven
nobility, or in the plain and simple but fine cloth of their servants. 
Guards also seem to be more numerous on this tier of the wealthy and
privileged.

Expensive, narrow homes, packed tightly here, represent the homes of the
lesser nobility.  The combination of magic and architecture that is so
common among the elven people make even these little luxury homes glimmer in
the dark like myriad fireflies hovering in a cloud.  Even though they are so
close together, each conveys the impression that they are still alone.

A large, grand house arrogantly demands attention here.  The cold
whiteness of the marble figures that decorate it are gorgeous, but seem to
deny even the possibility of touching such perfection.  Velvet curtains
flutter in the windows, and here and there a servant can be seen gliding in
front of a window in the process of completing some chore.  An elegant
diamond inscribed on forbidding gates is the only clue to the owner.  To the
east and west, the grand movement of Pendefigaeth Circle continues.

Due to their immense wealth and power, the noble people who live on this
street have been able to indulge themselves in the form of their homes. 
It's immediately obvious that they did so, as well.  A traditional mansion
sits stolidly here between a home that seems to mimic the flow of a tree and
a home that seems to be all spinnarets and spires.

Flower petals shift gently in the breeze, slowly moving off the pavement
to settle like colorful tears on the yards that surround this street.  The
air itself is hushed, as if afraid of offending the very wealthy and
powerful elves that live here, or becoming, perhaps, too much like them. 
More fabulous and extravagent homes can be seen on either side of the road.

Pendefigaeth Circle curves gracefully to the east and south here, but
this section of the street is quieter...  The ornate homes have the used
look that often accompanies the lack of sufficient funding to keep a place
running at the necessary level.  A thick stand of trees separates the homes
here from the homes to the south, and it almost looks as if everything is
trying to lean to the north.

trees to the south.

more so.  To the south, each home disappears into a fierce, dark woodland.

Frissons of awareness, the faintest touch of magic trails lightly down

homes, sometimes twining through the windows.

Pendefigaeth Circle~
In indulging what appears to be absolutely terrible taste, someone has
created an extremely obnoxious mansion.  Pink fluted marble columns rise up
at angles to an over-decorated roof, where the figures might be elves
intertwining, but there are too many of them to tell exactly what they might
be doing.  It doesn't look like anything a mother would approve of if she
saw it.  The roof is covered with bright yellow tiles.  It looks as if
someone very rich and very foolish decided to forego an architect and
decorate themselves.  The large stand of trees that separate this place from
the rest of the street suddenly make sense.

Huge, overstated homes show the tiny but inimitable signs of vacancy

only by the occasional raucous call of unseen persons.

A Study of Roses~
The memory of cigar smoke wavers in the air here.  This room is slightly
simpler than the ornate and fanciful rooms that surround it.  The carpet,
however, is still the richest of deep, forest green, and the polished black
marble of the desk and bookshelves speak of an opulence unattainable by
most.  The subtle carving of roses along the edge of the desk is almost
unnoticeable, black etched on black, but even in this study, clearly meant
for men, the rose motif endures.  A large picture, not so much a picture as
a magical rendering of an image, hangs on one wall between bookcases.

A large elven man, clad in deep green, and with the thoughtful look of a
mage, stands beside an elegant older woman, his hand resting lightly on her
shoulder.  A dark-haired boy, thin and sober looking, smiles a little from
his place between two angelically beautiful blonde elven girls in their
teens.  While the magic that created this picture captured the looks of the
family perfectly, it also seems to mirror their flaws: the pride of the old
man, the condescension in the eyes of the mother, the sorrow of the boy, and
the shining innocence and naivete of the two young women.

You blink as you enter this room.  Balls of light illuminate every corner

open on the table nearest you...  Dangerously close to a flame that crackles
under an acrid smelling beaker filled with something purple.  From another
contraption, a faint whine grates on your nerves.

Luxurious carpets are piled so thickly on the floor here, that your feet

room matches the carpet: rich, sumptious, and very, very expensive.  This is
obviously where the ducal family receives visitors.  A subtle rose motif has
been embroidered on the drapes and cushions.

A smooth ebony floor, embedded with tiny sparkling chips of some metal,
spreads out before you in this massive room.  Chairs line the walls, and a
full orchestria pit is to the far south of this room.  The walls are
lavishly painted with stylized depictions of the night sky, and the ceiling
as well, so dancing here would seem like dancing in the heart of the
universe, lit by crystal chandelier stars.

Your feet sink slowly into the wildly-colored rug here, releasing some
kind of scent held within the rug, as if you were standing on a huge mound
of flowers.  A round, circular table is the centerpiece of the room, smooth,
polished grey marble with lazy streaks of white and rose drifting across it.
It is surrounded by chairs, all alike save for an almost throne-like seat
that is the only one against a wall.  The backs of all of the other chairs
are open, exposed, and vulnerable...  To the south, a room like the night
sky can be seen.

Rose Balcony~
Flagstones pattern the feel of the balcony under your feet, and contrast

of this balcony.  The passionate red twines around the quieter white roses
in a beauty that carries a lession you can't quite grasp.  The sky and
Ilewyen seem equally close and far away.

graceful marble staircase begins here and winds its way down.

Empty Twinned Roses~
Two canopied beds, hidden behind veils of white, cobweb-delicate silk,
sit abandoned in this large and empty room.  Twin wardrobes hang slightly
ajar, fading color whispering from inside.  The air in this room is still,
cold from the lack of life in this room.  Everything is as perfect as a
fairy palace, down to the unlit fireplace and the dainty slipper that sits
alone forlornly under the bed.  Too perfect, it seems you have disturbed a
shrine, though to what?  Or to whom?

Master of Roses~
A thick, white rug of some soft, expensive material covers the floor. 
Against this pristine purity the furniture, dark, polished wood, gleams like
blood in the snow.  A large four poster bed arrogantly demands attention in
the center of the room, and small marble busts are scattered about the room.
Something shifts and blurs, and a bust nearby takes on a different face. 
Looking around the room, at the faces endlessly changing, you shiver.  Who
could live here?

Simple Roses~
This bedroom is the least ornate of the bedrooms so far.  It has a simple
cover on a bed of wood that seems almost to breathe.  Spiral shimmers of
magic light the room, and a seemingly endless stack of books spills off the
bed onto the floor, disappearing under the bed.  A small collection of
exotic daggers graces one wall above a fireplace, blades lit in reflected
flames.  A desk, the surface littered with crumpled `hpapers`l sits near the
door.  On the desk, dark ink from an upturned inkwell drips slowly out.  ``

You pick up one of the papers, and straighten it to better read it.

When We Dance~
Smooth, polished stone seems to move sinuously beneath your feet, as if
you are the one who is still, and the ground the one who rushes onward with
the implacability of the tides.  Elves, glittering in wealth, move together
and apart, never more paradoxically elven than now.  Their privilege (for no
peasant may dance here) gives an air of falsity to what would otherwise be
too real to bear.

Magic roars in your mind and courses throughout your body here.  It is
only a faint reflective echo of the building that stands to the east, triple
strands of black, grey, and white entwining ever upwards.  A small door,

handle beckoning to you.

Rose Meeting Room~
This meeting room was fairly obviously built for and by mages.  Nestled
into the side of the gigantic Mage Tower, this room has two exits, one of
which leads deeper into the heart of the Guild.  Rather than being wide or
long, this room is tall.  Numerous small tables and chairs drift quietly
around the rim of the room, from a single large chair at the top to a full,
wide circle of chairs in a ring on the ground.

Uncertainty is here the ground of being.  This place slowly dies between

young toughs that might otherwise be dismissed as gutter trash.

spray across the floor.  A small, elven woman smiles, her hands busy with
some kind of living sculpture that moves under her hands as she weaves it
into the shape of someone's dream.

North Satingan Square~
The thrilling shiver of awareness of magic trembles, the twisting coils
of the mage tower to the east emanating the remembered echo of long-gone
magery.  Here you can see out, over the borders of the odd golden streets,
and can marvel at the lovely world far below.  This is the edge of the tier,
and a thick, scalloped fence warns everyone away from the edge, a tiny
`cgreen plaque`l`l whispering in the wind from one of the bars of the fence.

lands of the elves approaches ever nearer.

This room is dark, shadowed.  No light penetrates this part of the mage

lighting in this guild.  Here the lights are limited, focused unusually into
tight beams of white light at the still figure of what looks like a sleeping

woman~
Long, dark hair, an odd mix of green and black, spills away in a cascade
from the delicate face of a young elven woman.  Her hands have been neatly
folded on her chest, and rise and fall with the slight movement of her
breath.  The simple tunic she wears is worn, patched, and of a strange cut
you do not recognize.  Something in the weariness that marks her face even
now speaks of a great loss, and a great sorrow.  Who knows how long she has
slept here within the light that cradles her silent form?

Magic is a part of life here, but nowhere is the impact of that stronger
than here, in the entrance to the Ilewyen Mage Guild.  The power that hummed
at a skeletal level outside this room is now a dull roar that cannot be
ignored.  Generations of mages have passed here, of all the levels of
Ilewyen, and even here, on the poorest of the levels, the echo of their
passing is strong.  A simple trapdoor down allows a tiny bit of a rank odor
to escape.

The Master's Room~
This room is plain, bare, and battered.  Scorch marks stain the walls,
and the remnants of a rug have given up all hope of ever being decent again.
Various small animals line the walls with tiny name tags, and one surprised
looking statue stands in the corner of the room.  The only furniture that
stands is the Master's Chair.  Here is where even the most powerful of mages
must bow down before the Master, and be equal with the lowliest apprentice.

It's a hole.  Literally.  The stone has a curious, waxy look to it that
