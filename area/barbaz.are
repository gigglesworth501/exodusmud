`bThis crack in the surface of the world seems to be leading down into
some kind of mining tunnels, and as with most mining tunnels in the realm,
these have probably been dug by dwarves.  You feel a chill emanating from
below, a cold that is more than just the moist low temperature that is
common to mines.  ``

`bThe low and narrow tunnels and the occasional rune carved into a wooden
beam confirms that these mining tunnels are indeed dwarven.  Nobody has been
mining here for a very long time though, dust is thick beneath and tools are
lying around in a disarray that a dwarf would never leave them in.  ``
