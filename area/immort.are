Heimdall, guardian of Bifrost, stands guard over the Rainbow Bridge.

Standing over 7 feet tall and muscled as only a god can be, Heimdall keeps
his unsleeping gaze over the Rainbow bridge.  His trusty Gjallor-horn never
leaves his side, and shall remain unwinded until the dread ship Naglfar sails
towards Valhalla on the dawn of Ragnarok.

cage~
"It was a cylindrical cage with sharp iron stakes inside.  When suspended
from the ceiling, it rotated very fast and contracted, driving the stakes
into the flesh of whatever unfortunate creature happened to be imprisoned
inside....  Elizabeth had the object installed in her bathing hall at
Kereshtur.....  One of the girls who had been scrubbing her had scratched
her with her fingernail.  Elizabeth lashed out angrily, striking the
servant.  But when she found that her slap had been ineffective, she called
on Darvulia to summon Ficzko (the strong stable servant).  Still in her
bath, she ordered her strong ex-lover and her woman to tie up the girl.  The
rotating cage was lowered, and the girl was made to crouch inside.  The cage
was then raised.  As the motion threw the girl from side to side, the long
nails pierced her body.  Her gushing blood showered Elizabeth below.  It was
an extraordinary sensation.  As the girl's blood rained on her, the gloomy
angel left Elizabeth's soul, and a mad joy possessed her.  Better than that,
her skin, at the places where the blood touched it, became younger, glowing
with new life."

`o[`nThe Zoo`o]``
Those who are very new to the city should attempt to venture towards
the east gate (east of the fountain down Cumberland), and south of
Farmer's Square, until they reach Welford Road.  Travelling south down
Welford, watch for signs indicating an Animal Exhibition (check your
map if you get lost), and venture inside  -  the zoo is a nice place
for adventurers to have fun and explore in before attempting to take
their quests out of the city.
 
`o[`cThe Eastern Prairie`o]``                 
After finding your bearings in the city of Thesden, travel east down
Cumberland until you find yourself in Farmer's Square.  From there,
go one south and east, and you will find yourself in the Eastern
Prairie, an excellent place for newcomers to explore and adventure
in.

stones~
`cIt seems odd that you have never noticed these `dstones`c before.  They
look as if they have been sitting here undisturbed for years.  The ground
around them is unbroken and the `dstones`c have settled comfortably into the
ground.  You can't tell exactly what kind of stone they are made of, but
they look worn by time and the elements and are completely covered in a
`jlush green velvetine moss`c.  You count five `dstones`c in all, and their
arrangement is too perfectly circular to have been natural.  The circle of
stones is about three feet across and very little grows within the circle.

$n smashes the orb into a thousand pieces.  A strong wind suddenly picks up and a whirlwind forms from the ground, whisking away $n and all evidence that the orb ever existed.~
The orb smashes into thousands of pieces.  A loud rushing sound, as if a dam was opened and the water was rushing out, can be heard.  A whirlwind forms at your feet, surrounds your body and whisks you and the orb fragments away.~
~
You lost consciousness.  You have awaken here in the void -- a void as featureless as the orb was without feature.~

`aKnowing that you're one made of sterner stuff, you walk up to the hole and jump in. Although you can't see a thing, you feel as if you're falling through an endless void as your stomach feels as if it is in your mouth.``~

`nBefore you can blink, you're in a sky blue void.  A black bird whizzes past you and when you look down you see a large, sandy expanse rush up to meet you.  Just as the`a hole`n in the sky closes, you hit the sand with a painful splat.~

fountain~
A bronze statue of King Devon Dunluce, the powerful man who founded the
Athanmere line, stands boldly atop the back of an enormous beast.  While
Devon's bronze eyes stare sightlessly southwards, towards the castle that
bears his name, the bronze beast rears slightly under his feet.  Water pours
from the mouth and blowhole of the beast, which appears something like a
cross between a giant crocodile and a whale.  The elaborate stone work that
holds the pool of water has been carefully sculpted with stories from the
life of Devon Dunluce.

Chamber of the Immortals~
Large, marble pillars line both sides of this massive hall.  Although
it is quite large, corners of it can be intimate.  At one end of this
rectangular room, a large marble fireplace stands with a thick oaken mantle
atop it.  Several comfortable, high-backed leather chairs are scattered around
the fireplace.  The other end of the massive chamber houses a large bar.  A
gigantic golden harp rests on top of a three-tiered pedestal in the center of
the room.  Beautiful music can be heard by the harp which magically plays
itself.  Various plants and small trees in pots can be seen here and there next
to couches, chairs and footstools that have been strategically placed around
the room.  The most dramatic thing about the room, however, is the windows.
Tall picture windows line three sides of this cavernous chamber with the
exception being the wall with the fireplace and the exit.  Almost all of Exodus
can be seen far below, through the crystal-clear windows.  You shudder with the
majesty of all that you see.

`lshows up in stark contrast to the hall's clean, white walls.  Twinkling

`llike dragon heads which are set into the walls.  Doors in the eastern and
`lwestern walls lead to the various sleeping and working chambers of the Exodus
`lImmortals.  A polished set of golden doors to the north lead to the Quest
`lArena.  A narrow staircase of iron spirals upward to a trapdoor in the ceiling.``

`iIndel's Condo``~
`gThe translucent rays of sunlight stream in from the large door that
overlooks the pristine waters of the shallow bay below.  A large hammock has
been strung on the balcony to relax in after a long day.  The interior of
this one room hideaway is nicely decorated with a white leather couch
against the far wall.  The large king size bed extends from the near wall
with a black comforter neatly covering it.  A silvery flash from the east
wall catches your eye, from what seems to be a `ihook.  ``

`fA Quiet Retreat``~
`gThis is a large round room atop a high `hstone`g tower.  There is no
entrance or exit visible.  A set of huge windows overlooks a `lwaterfall`g, a
`lr`ia`ji`kn`ib`mo`lw`g arcing out of the fine mist at its base.  On one side of the room is
a huge stone fireplace, with a roaring `ifire`g going.  Before it is a soft rug
of rare `owhite`g fur.  A writing desk sits on the other side of the room, with
a few scattered papers- Amber's notes.  A soft velvet coverd sofa is in the
center of the room.  Before it sits a gleaming wood table with `bwine`g and two
glasses.``

`cColin's Cabin``~
`aThe cabin is only one room, but it is larger than many buildings, and
it looks to have all the comforts that one could ask.  There is a huge
native stone fireplace that seems to be used not only to warm the place, but
to cook as well.  The roaring fire is comforting and also functional.  The
building material for most of the cabin is large hand hewn timbers that must
have taken some effort to cut and move to the site.  There are windows in
all directions, except for west, which afford various views into the woods,
and there is a handmade ladder which leads upward to a sleeping loft``.  ``

`aAs you step out onto the balcony, the impressive view pulls the very
breath from your lungs.  It is impossible to know from the front of the
cabin that it is perched precariously on the edge on a mountainside, but one
look at the majestic panorama and you understand exactly why this site was
chosen.  The greenery of the forest below gives way to the seas to the west
which reflect the twinkle of lights.  The sunsets seen from this precipice
are the most magnificent in all the realm.  You only wish you could stay
forever...  ``

Goldmund's Study~
Inscribed in gold on the plain wall of this office, in an ancient script,
the following words are written: `k"S'io credesse che mia risposta fosse A
persona che mia tornasse al mondo Questa fiamma staria senza piu scosse.  Ma
perciocche giammai di questo fondo Non torno vivo alcun, s'i'odo il vero,
Senza tema d'infamia ti rispondo."  `l The walls of the study are lined with
books, ancient and tattered, in wooden shelves.  A small desk hard wooden
chair sit before the only window.  A narrow pit leads down into murky
darkness below.

`n_-^`oThe Tea Room`n^-_``~
`gA large room full of elegant and widely varied furnishings extends
around you.  The walls are the blue of robins' eggs, and the floor is warm
polished oak.  Along the west wall is set a `bmahogany buffet`g with a large
`hsilver tea set `gand many delicate bone china cups and saucers.  Next to
the tea cups are cakes, sandwiches, and other snacks.  In complete contrast,
along the east side extends a long, rough, wooden bar, with a toothless old
bartender of indeterminable race.  He's clearly very old and wrinkled and
smelly though.  Next to the bar sits a long `dtrestle table `gand a pair of
benches.  All are made of thick wood deeply scarred with blade marks- the
'emphasis' of many vro'ath and dwarven 'discussions'.  At the bar is served
strong drink of all sorts and various types of food- both for only the
stoutest of heart (and digestion.)  In the center of the northern wall
stands a huge `kfireplace`g.  Surrounding it are all sorts of furniture:
velvet loveseats, silken divans, hard wooden stools, elfskin wingbacked
chairs, even a strange crystal swing.  Next to the fireplace is a small
platform where musicians set up to play.  Out the south wall wide windows
overlook the busy streets of `lThesden`g.  A set of elegant wooden stairs
leads downwards, back to the bustle of the city.  ``

Serenity's Meditation Room~
You feel warmth and calm as u enter Serenity's abode.  This room is for
meditation.  As u scan the room, you see several plants and flowers blooming
on the window sill.  Your eyes follow the ray of sunshine from the windows
to the china rug on the floor.  The warmth is so enticing that you decide to
sit down and clear your thoughts.

`bThe Chambers of the Countess Bathory``~
`aThe walls of this room are a dull grey, only a thin stream of dim light
pours in through the narrow window.  These subtle beams fall onto a
`bpainting`` `awhich hangs above the large, four poster bed.  The cold
stones of the floor are covered in a number of burgandy, velvet rugs.  There
is a ebony vanity table along the opposite wall, with a gold-trimmed
`bmirror`` `ahanging above.

The painting depicts a skeletal figure of what once may have been a
beautiful young woman, hanging in a cage in a city square.  A number of
small boys are gathered around the base of the cage.  
 
An inscription beneath reads:
`kFor I saw with my own eyes the Sibyl of Cumae hanging in a cage,
and when the boys said to her, "Sibyl, What do you wish?"
she used to reply "I wish to die."

`kA Contemplation Glade``~
`nAs you look around an incredible feeling of peace and harmony fills your
entire being.  Everything here feels perfectly in tune with everything else,
interlocked in a pulsating mesh of life.  The glade is dominated by a pond. 
It's glacial surface reflecting `owhite `npuffy clouds as they slowly drift
overhead.  Occasionaly large `ired `nand `owhite `nfish drift to the surface
to feed, and maybe look at another world.  A stream tumbles down a waterfall
on the far side, spanned by a small wooden bridge.  A dirt path leads off to 
the left and right, passing through beautiful evergreens and bansai trees.
Time seems to have no meaning here.

`aA Shadowy Hideout``~
`a`o`aA light from an unknown and unidentifiable source glows dimly in this
room.  There is a window which allows an occassional breeze to waft in and
circulate the air.  However, only darkness greets your eyes when you look
out the window.  Obviously, Devin does not want you to know the exact
location of this room in the world.  Finely carved redwood cabinets and
display cases line two of the walls.  Behind the glass doors of these
cabinets are sparkling gems, jewelry, and odd trinkets.  `a`o`aAn ancient, but
still finely polished, oaken table serves as a work space.  Besides a few
scattered papers with incomprehensible writing on them, there is a
collection of meticulously wrought and razor sharp daggers on the table. 
Near the table is a very comfortable looking chair, dyed azure.  Farther
away are a couple of velvet couches for guests.  Finally, in one corner of
the room, a large divan with a silk coverlet waits patiently for `k`a`k`o`a`kAmber.````

The tortured moans of the inhabitants of this boat can be heard from

and the blackened stains on the walls tell tales of both violence and death.
A small hatch leads to a slave galley below, and rope ladders trail off of

`bKalus' Hideaway``~
Log walls and a hardwood floor make this rather small cabin ...  Cozy. 
Rugs hang from every wall and cover most of the floorspace.  A perpetual
fire burns in the fireplace, leaving no ashes, yet the temperature feels
chilly enough to want to warm hands near the fire.  The air smells of spiced
apples, and a bluebird can be heard calling off somewhere in the distance. 
There are no exits to the cabin.

`oThe`k Moon`o Pool``~
`aDark and`k light`a.  Those are your first impressions as you appear in
this small, but spacious room.  Darkness shrouds the circumference of this
place, giving you the impression that you are out in the open, however that
cannot be, can it?  The only `olight`a issues forth from a round`n pool`a
rimmed with a low, stone wall on which one can sit.  Inside the circular
wall,`k liquid gold`o brightly`k gleams`a before you.  When you reach down
to touch the`o s`nh`oi`nm`om`ne`or`ni`on`ng`a liquid with your fingertips,
ringed ripples appear on the surface where your fingers touched, and ripple
out to the edges of the pool.  `lGasping`a with shock, you blink in
disbelief as the ripples continue through the pool and wave over you as if
the very fabric of reality were rippling over you.  As quickly as you
started them in the center of the pool, the ripples calm within the liquid
as well as in the space in which you sit, until all is still once more. 
Looking down into the pool of the`o moon`a one can see the various things
that only the `omoon`a sees:`i lovers'`b trysts`a,`e witches' dances`a,
secret meetings, stolen moments,`h peaceful slumber`a, grusome killings,`o
Life`k and`a Death.  All of it is here for you to see in the mortal world,
if you dare look close enough into the pool.  ``

Inside the Magical Box~
A true marvel of divine magic, this box is much larger on the inside than it
is on the outside.  You have plenty of room to stand in here and even move
around a bit.  As is the fad with Minax these days, there is a sign posted
on the wall, explaining the way this quest will work.

sign~
`oThis magical quest is made up of seven parts.  Scattered throughout the realms
are seven hidden portals.  These portals are easy to miss unless you look with
great care.  The portals also blink in and out, so you may need to look around
for a while before you notice them, but the portal will always reappear in the
same room.  it will not move around.  If you find a portal you should enter it
to claim the prize inside.  You should only enter the portal that matches your
level range.  Inside you will find a clue to the final puzzle and a voucher to
get a quest token.  The voucher cannot be redeemed if you are not within range
of the specified levels.  The portals are generally found in or close to areas
where players of that range would go to level or to get equipment.
``
`oThe `kfirst`o portal is for players level 13 and under, which narrows things a lot
since there are only a few places friendly to those levels.  The `ksecond`o portal
is for players level 14-26 and those adventurers should look for it in an out-
of-the-way place in an area where they might go to fight.  The `kthird`o portal is
for players level 27-39 and can be found underground.  The `kfourth`o portal is to
players level 40-53 and can be found in the midst of a test.  The `kfifth`o portal
is in a bright and sunny place and is to levels 54-66.  The `ksixth`o is inside an
ancient fortress and is for characters level 67-79.  The `kseventh`o portal is far
off in a ruined place of the dead and is meant for players level 80 and above.
``
`oIn each portal, a clue can be found.  Pay close attention, because it will fit
into a riddle.  When the riddle is solved, you will have clues to the location
of the eighth and final portal.  This portal will not blink and will always be
present, but it will also be invisible to the naked eye.  If you wish to enter
it, you may have to search long and hard and scour the whole area to find your
way in.  Here's the riddle.  Blanks are left fo where the clues fit in:
``
`iWhen * * me * * * me but * * you.
``
`oRemember, only go after the portal that fits your level range.  For some parts
of the quest, you may do well to share your information with others, but don't
forget that there can only be one ultimate winner.``

thirty seconds.  ``

The Immortal Psychiatrist's Office~
This plush office is one of oppulence.  A large, polished desk stands in
front of a window from which one can see the city of Thesden laid out in its
entirety from a distance.  Massive bookshelves line the walls, filled with
an assortment of books of every size, shape and color imaginable.  A glass
case houses some delicate scrolls that look centuries old.  On a small
pedestal by the door rests a bust of the human head with a cross section cut
out of it.

`cThe `bPlace `cof the Tree-Soul``~
The civilized aura of `dExodus `cfalls away, leaving behind the mists of the 
present. All around you, old growth trees spring up, driven from the soil by
the warm `ksun`c, the gentle `lrain`c, and the `oLaw`c that guides this place.
Faint `gpaths`c, wending this way and that, streak the primeval forest like old
scars. A quiet clearing appears from the undergrowth, as if this was the site
of old `bmagics`c, too puissant to deign to support life. Set around this 
clearing, like witnesses to ancient majesty, are tall `dstone `clamps, which
burn some kind of dark, glossy substance that generates no smoke. In the center
of the clearing squats the stump of some unknown tree, blasted to its core and
still `ismoking`c faintly in the warm summer night air. Perhaps it saw the dawn
of `hCreation`c, or perhaps it was the source of ancient power used to spark it.

`eXork's Garage``~
``Xork's room looks sort of like a stable, but doesn't smell quite as
bad.  There are black, greasy`6 spots`` on the floor and many small
metallic`o parts`` lying around like someone exploded a sword, although
the parts seem too consistantly made and too finely constructed to
have formed from an accident.  In the center of the room lies a
large brown`d table`` more of the metallic parts and a few larger
pieces.  On the walls are all sorts of wierd, out of place, clubs, but
their balance and functionality seems somewhat wrong.

`eThe Gathering of Darkness````~
`lSun has fled.  Moon failed.  Stars wink away one by one.  Only the
lights of intellect and power remain.  Silence envelops, joining the
darkness.  The only stirring is the faint motion of air- the memory of soft
wings, and the fading vibration of ancient spells.  ``

A bright light briefly shines above and $n suddenly drops down into existence next to you.~
$n leaps upward into the blackness above you and you are suddenly blinded by a bright light.  The light suddenly disappears and spots appear before your eyes.~

`i@`c>-,-'-`o The Wedding Chapel`c -'-,-<`i@``~
`oYou stand inside a small, woodland chapel.  A stained glass window
behind the altar glimmers as the sun shines through it.  The pews on both
sides of the long, red aisle leading to the altar have been adorned with
white bows and green garland.

The Exodus Senior Staff Meeting Chambers~
`lThe first thing that is noticed upon entering this large, round room,
is that aside from the stone floors and walls and the large round table
positioned in the middle of the room, this room is very much featureless. 
There are no banners, no tapestries or insignias to announce any one
particular person's preference for a clan, race or even profession.  A
large, heavy, round table stand`ls in the center of the high-ceilinged room,
ringed by seven large, padded, elather chairs.  A circle of `hsilver`l runes
have been inscribed in a circle in the central portion of the table, in a
language long lost to all mortal races.  The inscription says, "`hTogether,
united, we stand`l."  Inside the circle of runes, a`n bluish`l metallic
brazier contains a quietly crackling`j green`l flame inside.  ``

`oUpon entering this area, you notice that the entire world is viewable
`othrough prism like glass in `oall directions, from the tallest mountains
`othrough the vast desert, spanning the huge ocean, even overlooking the
`oall holy City of the Sun... The cave keep of the Krathen and the
`olabyrinth just north of it. You notice exits in `oall directions.``

Lazarus' Hideaway~
As you look about the room, you notice a soft glow that illuminates the
walls. The room is sparsely furnished, with a soft dirt floor. There are no
exits to the room, as it feels like a pocket withdrawn from the world, where
one need not care about mundane things.

Torture Chamber~
Various implements of rather questionable origin fill this stone chamber.
The flickering light from the torches mounted on the cold, stone walls
reflect off of the iron maiden standing in the corner.  A well-oiled rack sits
in the center of the room, unused.  A large wooden 'X' with manacles attached to
it stands against one wall.  On a table nearby an add assortment of metal
and leather implements rest.  A large oaken door leads to the east.

An Upper-Story Bedroom~
A faint scent of jasmine seems to fill this high-ceilinged, airy room, the
center of which is occupied by a massive canopy bed filled with `im`ku`jl`nt`li`mc`io`kr`je`nd`l
pillows in pastel colors.  The quiet `hn`no`gt`le`es`l of wind chimes tinkle as the
breeze from the open balcony nearby jingles them as they hang overhead.
The balcony overlooks the famed city of Thesden and the outlying territories
behind it.   A doorway leads to the west.

`kThe Mithraeum``~
`aThis cavern was carved out of the raw rock of the earth by teams of the
god Mithra's devoted worshippers.  The vaulted ceiling covers a smallish
area that spans around thirty by seventy feet.  Rough-hewn low stone benches
are evenly spaced in parallel lines from front to back, leaving a small
aisle down the middle of the room.  A cunning series of mirrors and
apertures funnels what light makes it through natural cracks in the stone
above, leaving the place bright and airy.  Against the back wall, behind a
`alow altar, is a `kgilded`a statue of Lord Mithra slaying a cosmic `ibull`a.``

`bA Snowed-in Mountain Cabin``~
`dRough wooden logs make up the walls of this serene cabin, the heavy
door is locked, shutting the howling snow storm out, and the warmth of the
heart in.  The one window is frosted shut and only a swirling white haze can
be seen through it.  The floor is covered by warm bear skins so one can walk
barefoot without having to worry about cold toes.  Beside the faint sound of
the wind, only the crackling of the red fire can be heard.  ``

`cThe Forester's Cabin``~
`dA very utilitarian cabin, with just one purpose: to work in.  Various
tools hang on the walls, mostly saws, hammers, files, and a large array of
gleaming steel knives.  A large workbench crowds the single room that the
interior of this cabin consists of, and under it, a scruffy chest is
located.  The timbered walls are made of de-barked logs, insulated by rope
and moss, letting no water, nor wind, through.  ``

`nLost in the Frost``~
`h
Hailstones rain from a cold pale gray sky. Glittering pure white snow
covers the ground like a blanket of freezing frost. From every single
direction imaginable, wind whips through the air, freezing unwelcomed
travelers to their very core.  Nothing  makes a sound here,  the only 
thing that  can be heard is the furious rushing of the winds. Looking
ahead,  you see that somewhere  in the distance lies the cold,  cruel 
tower of the Ice Goddes,  although you somehow can't seem to make out
the direction in which it resides. Chilled to your bone, you suddenly
hear the angry scream of a woman enraged. Yet frightened you are, you
are mystically  entranced to move forward.  Not knowing where you are
truly headed.
