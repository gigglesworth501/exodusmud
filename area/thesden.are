Loris~
Loris~
Loris looks up from feeding his fish as you enter.
~
Loris' gentle smile is known throughout the Realm, and it is a subject of
much speculation just how this chubby, soft-spoken man survived his time as
an adventurer and earned enough treasure to open up his famous Thesden shop.
Light reflects a bit off the top of his head, which is round and hairless as
an egg.  Still, Loris seems happy in his quiet life, tending his animals,
and ordering in goodies from the bakery.

The Innkeeper~
A tall, thin man with thick black hair asks if you would like a room.
~
Hazel eyes sparkle at you from above a mustache turning silver with age,
as the Innkeeper returns your curious gaze with one of his own.  He smiles,
and pours himself another ale.  The ale disappears at an amazing rate, and
he tidies up his business, moving chairs fussily, carefully.  His nose is a
bit red, and his eyes just a bit bleary, but his actions are unimpaired.

Mincer Ray~
An old weather-beaten man is here, a long scar along his cheek.
~
A reformed pirate, Mincer Ray retired to Thesden once he was granted
amnesty by the King.  His years show in the deep wrinkles on his face and
thinning grey hair, but he still moves with surprising speed when he wishes.
Local rumor even whispers of a torrid affair with another retired
adventurer, but Mincer Ray only smiles and winks when asked.

The grocer~
A young farmer is here, tending her carts.
~
Young, but with hands roughened from field work, this girl smiles shyly
at you from behind her produce cart.  Her clothing shows smudges and dirt,
which show the fading of an outfit carefully (but not successfully) cleaned
after a hard day's labor.  Although she is the youngest of the sellers here,
her produce looks very fresh and clean, and in better shape than the other
farmers' products.

The tanner~
A young man looks up from stretching a deer pelt as you enter.
~
The tanner looks up, and you catch a glimpse of warm brown eyes, before
he lowers them again to his work.  Known for his reluctance to speak, the
merchant is still one of the more popular shopkeepers in town, for the
quality of his waterskins.  While he is young to have his own shop, he is
undeniably an artist.  His clever hands are rarely ever still, whether
checking a pelt being stretched, or carefully softening a pair of half-done
boots, already incredibly soft, in the small size of a woman.  When asked,
he will say only that the boots are not for sale.

Although clearly aging, Narcissus bears himself like a much younger man.

A melancholy young woman is here, tapping her fingers on the counter.
~
The familiarity of the curve of her cheeks, and the movement of her dark
hair is puzzling for a moment, until she moves to tidy under the picture of
the brunette, which is, clearly her.  However, while the painting shows no
imperfections, Lyra is a merely pretty girl, with all the usual flaws of
humanity.  She watches everyone in the shop with skeptical eyes, toying with
an intricately-detailed leather belt.  She waits for her customers to make a
purchase or leave, her thoughts her own.

Never trust the food baked by a thin man.  If that's true, then this
baker's food must be delicious!  This man is enormously round, but he seems
pretty happy, if impatient.  His apron bears smudges of chocolate, what
looks like jam, and smells of flour and vanilla.  Moving with a grace that
belies his ponderous girth and quadruple chins, he has all the efficiency
and joy of someone who truly loves his job.

Samuel the clothier~
The clothier is here, patching an old jacket.
~
A large, strong-looking man, the clothier looks at first to be more
capable of wielding a sword than a needle and thread.  Those who know
Samuel, however, know that his size is deceptive, for the clothier is
incredibly nimble with a needle, but deathly ill at the sight of blood.  Age
has treated him as it treats most men, adding a bit of extra weight here and
there, and coloring the hair left in his receding hairline with grey among
the darker brown strands.  Always nattily attired, the clothier wears his
own goods with a certain amount of flair, if little flash.

A rugged, bearded young man is fixing a frayed rope here.
~
Tall, lean, and healthy looking, Thyrn is dressed completely in the
latest survival gear, none of which has a spot of dirt or wear upon it. 
Although he seems to be repairing a rope readily enough, his hands have none
of the calluses you see on the hands of an adventurer, or even a physical
laborer.  Shaggy brown hair seems to have been deliberately cut uneven to
give that uncut look, but his small beard is well trimmed.

A handsome young stable boy is here, selling supplies.
~
With Evyns cap of burnished russet hair, and charming dimpled
smile, it's no wonder all of Thesden's young ladies flock
to the Gray Gelding Stable, cooing adoration.  But a glint
in his eye belies dreams of exploration and adventure, not of
husbandry, which he hopes someday to experience after his
apprenticeship ends.  As he brushes the silken mane of a
chestnut hair, you can't help but admire his long slender fingers,
and his smooth, steady touch.

A neatly dressed woman stands behind the counter waiting to help you.

A slim, dark-haired woman of indeterminate age, Serra is a Thesden
fixture.  She dresses neatly but conservatively, in the manner of most
bankers.  Although the fabric of her garment is a fine, skillful weaving,
the chaste cut of it and her manner make it clear that she is all business. 
The cut of her hair hides the tips of her ears, but her face is too round to
be elven, and too angular to be human.

the crowd.  Occasionally, she nods at an open sack lying at her feet with a
few silver pieces in it.  She must not have been trained at the college,
because anyone so talented who graduated from the college of music would be
in a noble's court, not on the street.

a young noble~
A young nobleman stares down his nose at you.
~
Dressed in an eminently impractical outfit of the finest cloth, complete
with padded, bejeweled codpiece, this young man declares himself a noble by
the sheer wastefulness of most of his outfit.  A high cravat tucked into a
bow at his chin seems about to strangle him, and his legs have been
cross-gartered so many times that it is amazing that all circulation in his
legs has not been cut off.

a noble woman~
A proud noble woman passes by, the crowd parting in front of her.
~
The noble woman is wearing only the finest clothes, probably imported
from distant lands.  Her movements are rehearsed and proper, no doubt a
result of her upbringing in a life or priviledge.  Her disdain for the
commoners around her is obvious as she strolls by pretending not to see the
most of the citizens with whom she shares the street.  She only allows her
gaze to be met by other members of Thesden's nobility.

seemingly happy, stand there for hours while others converse.  Anyone who

he seems to have a propensity to bump into people.

As is apparent from the silver that gilds his head, Ylris is an older
elf, perhaps one of the eldest in Thesden.  His dark eyes, often distant
with thought, have something of a sadness to them, particularly when he
looks at the tapestry in his office.  Elegant pointed ears poke through the
hair that needs a combing, and his robe show signs of former elegance worn a
bit too long, and now just a bit shabby from neglect.  Rumor has it that the
master, known for being more interested in magical theory than use,
teleported himself out of Ilewyen one day and just never noticed that he had
changed location.

Vanya is a beautiful human woman with long brown hair and a slender
figure.  She is well-known throughout these lands as a fierce protector of
the woods and all who would live within its borders.  She has risen up
through the ranks of the rangers to lead them, and rightfully so, despite
her relatively young age.

`oSir Vedros``~
`oSir Vedros, the warrior guildmaster, stands here proudly.``
~
Sir Vedros stands and walks with all the grace of a man in his sixties,
but with the energy and strength of a man half that age.  Cold blue eyes
stare at you compassionately, watching your moves, but not judging you. 
Clearly, he is a man who wants to pass on his knowledge.  He stands a bit
over six feet tall and has straight brown shoulder-length hair and a long
mustache to match.  Vedros was a soldier in King Athanmere's Argent army who
distinguished himself in combat, eventually rising through the ranks to lead
the King's personal bodyguards.  Sworn to defend his King to the death,
Vedros now serves the crown as a guildmaster and teacher of young warriors.

Still slim and fit looking, Ivan shows few signs of his age other than
the silken patch that covers one eye, and the streaks of silver that trace
through his hair.  Ivan is neither noble nor particularly gracious in
appearance or manner, but rather the kind of guy that you would lose easily
in a crowd.  This, in all likelihood, has stood this premier thief in good
stead throughout his long and colorful career.

In her youth, the bard Aldera was known throughout the Realm for her
adventuring prowess.  She was among the first to ropen communications with
the distant Keep of Krathen, some say in order to incorporate the odd
whistling music of the Krathe into her repertoire.  Now, she has happily
retired from adventuring, and, as she will tell anyone who asks, doing as
all bards should dream of doing: sitting on her duff dispensing her opinion
as if it was priceless to the younger generation.  As she will readily
admit, Aldera is more than happy to enjoy a peaceful life, with a roof over
her head, plenty of good food, and someone to pick up after her.

Thesden for Pook of the Hand, the undisputed lord of the dark side of
`aThesden, and perhaps even more than that.  But one day the courier's
curiousity got the better of him and he opened a package that he was
supposed to deliver to Pook...  Inside he found several rubies, emeralds and
`adiamonds.  Being a thief and all, he decided to keep this fortune,
foolhardily risking the wrath of Pook.  ``

pook hand~
Pook~
Pook reclines in an armchair here, assured that nobody would dare to attack him.
~
`aPook is known to the citizens and nobles of Thesden as 'Pook the
benevolent' handing out money to the poor, and donating money to the farmers
of the Eastern Prairie.  Of course, being the bastard son of Ferath
Athanmere himself, nothing less is to be expected.  `aAt thirteen years of
age Pook swore he would one day rule Thesden, though he later realized that
he would not become king because he is not a 'true' son of the Athanmere
line.  One day when he was wandering the streets of the city he met a man
that later would become his best friend.  Spink, as he was named, was
deformed and cross-eyed, but he had a winning personality.  Pook immideatly
took a liking to the ugly little man.  As it turned out, Spink was initially
trying to get a noble connection inside the Castle Dunlace.  See, Spink was
actually one of the best thieves in all of Thesden, if not the best.  In
Pook he saw great potential for the dark arts.  Over the years he took Pook
with him on little quests, 'pranks' as he called them.  Stealing from the
rich and giving to the poor, he said, of course he was not very picky about
the last part of that sentence.  Without Pook realizing it, he was taught to
be the perfect thief, with all the treats that belong, lockpicking,
pickpocketing, sneaking and spying.  At the age of seventeen, Pook had
access to the Royal Treasure Chamber thanks to his skills with a lock pick. 
What Spink had recognized in Pook was not only charisma and leader skills
but also a far above average intelligence.  Pook soon understood what kind
of person Spink was, a thief and a murderer.  But he found that he liked
that way of life and he was soon accepted into '`hThe Hand`a', the thief and
assassin guild of Thesden.  Years passed and Pook was soon only second to
Ivan.  His genius in the arts of larceny and assassination in fact surpassed
even Ivan's.  When he was nineteen years of age he challenged Ivan for the
leadership of '`hThe Hand`a'.  It was a duel of skill and dexterity but Pook
left the duel as the leader of the guild, and from that day on, Ivan would
be known as Ivan One-eye.  And though Pook rules the underworld of Thesden,
he keeps the facade of a nobleman.  Living in a mansion that is only
outshined by Harris's.

ransak~
Ransak~
Ransak the Fist is towering above you, always ready to defend its master.
~
`aAfter a close encounter with one of Jericka's, the assassin guild master,
dagger, Pook decided that he needed an ever-watching bodyguard.  For even a
Master Thief can not be awake all the time.  He talked to an old aquiantance
of his, Anouen Forundal, about this and was soon provided with a solution, a
golem.  Anouen asked Pook to bring him fresh corpses of Sidhe and Vro'ath
as the components of the flesh golem.  Pook had no problem with getting the 
corpses.  Anouen built a golem with the parts from the Vro'ath corpses and 
covered his creation with a skin of Sidhe hide.  Combining the strengths of 
the Vro'ath and the magical abilities of the Sidhe skin, Anouen had created 
an almost indestructable Juggernaut.  The only problem was that the creature 
had no soul and no will to obey anyone.  Anouen solved this by sacrificing a
dozen`k Runes of Convergence`a to the demon lord Iverath, and asked if the
demon could inbue Anouen's creation with the soul of a devil.  Iverath
accepted the offering and brought the flesh golem to life.
`a
The golem was named Ransak and was clothed in heavy chain coif and mail to 
hide its hideous features.  Only two great tusks and the devil-red eyes can 
be seen from under the coif as it watches your every move.``

Dr. Giggles, the sawbones~
`hThe local sawbones 'Doctor' Giggles invites you over to the examination table.``
~
Yup, he has that look.  You know, that 'mad scientist' look.  Licking his
scalpel, he looks you up and down, as if to decide where to start cutting
first.  His apron is a rubbery red leather, and you have no misconceptions
of why it is of that particular color.

A drunk noble woman~
`fA drunk noble woman lies in a heap on the bed, snoring loudly.``
~
How...  Lovely..  This snoring, drooling and not to mention middle-aged
woman lies sprawled on a canopy bed here.  Tresses of sweaty blonde hair
covers her face and neck, fluttering slightly as she snores.  A low-cut
dress made of pink silk reveals way too much saggy skin for your liking, but
you were just here to rob her anyways, right?

A veteran guard~
A Thesden guard is here, protecting the innocent and jailing people like you.
~
This guard looks fit and alert, looking about carefully for suspicious
activity.  A little silver touches the hair of this guard, and a few crows
feet track at the the corners of the eyes of this guard.  Experience has
toughened this guard and increased his effectiveness.  Somewhere along the
way, he has picked up a fondness for devil's weed.  A well-honed blade rests
easily in his hand.

A bum~
A bum lies comfortably in a heap of something..not clean.

He looks kind of filthy, he smells it too.  Fighting with the rats, dogs
and alley cats of Thesden for every meal, you see bite and scratch marks on
his face and arms.  He is missing most of the hair of his head, that would
be much needed on cold nights.  He burps and farts uncontrollably, what a
charming fellow.

Aphrun the innkeep~
An aging, burly man with thinning hair offers you a room.
~
A burly, aging man, Aphrun exemplifies an Innkeeper.  His eyes, how they
twinkle!  His dimples, how merry!  His cheeks are like roses, and his nose
like a (rather suspect) cherry!  His droll little mouth is drawn up like a
bow, and the beard on his chin is as white as snow.  A jolly old man, he's
quick to laugh, and when he does, his little round belly shakes, like a bowl
full of jelly.

of why the monks recently decided to leave their peaceful mountain village. 
Rumors have that they were driven out, but given the nature of these monks,
you find that to be highly unlikely.  The man before you is a little on the

`aAt first glance, all that can be seen is a glimmer.  Upon taking a
second look, you see that the light grey eyes of this man are wise but not
old.  The silvery hair reflects back even the slightest light that it
catches.  Pure steel is what comes to mind, combined with the strong body
and its silvery accoutrements, when considering this opponent.  While very
serious, there are laugh lines upon the face of this man.  He is one to help
a friend without being asked, and can be the worst of enemies to those that
dare.  Be sure to decide which of these you wish to be.  Wisdom comes to all
in time, but steeliness and cunning are inborn traits--obviously given to
this man at birth.  ``

A wandering minstrel, clad in gaudy finery, stands here entertaining passersby.

This young man smiles at you with eyes too wide and guileless to be truly
so.  His hair is cut short, and curls around an open, friendly face, rather
like that of puppy.  As if to compensate for his appearance, Baxan's outfit
is outlandish to an extreme.  He wears a tunic that is a rainbow of
brilliant color, tie-dyed.  His leggings are not only cross-gartered with
silvery laces, but cut out shapes, round circles of black, and golden stars
complete the garish outfit.  A worn, polished lyre hangs over a shoulder,
safely strapped (with orange and mauve straps!)  So as not to get in the way
of any acrobatic performances.

A drifter, wrapped in a leather cloak, wanders the streets.

The drifter wears a hooded cloak with the hood hanging loose behind her
back.  She has long brown hair and eyes that sparkle as she scans the crowds
around her.  Nobody pays her much mind and she goes about her business as a
foreigner, passing through Thesden en route to destinations unknown.  As she
walks, her cape swings open, giving you a good look at an arsenal of blades
hanging from her belt.  Perhaps she is an assassin for hire, or perhaps just
an adventurer who is just in town for the day.

clear that Roscoe has not made his living performing physical labor.  As he

Birger the Bounty Hunter~
A sinewy man lurks here, eyeing you suspiciously.
~
Known all throughout Thesden for his amazing skills of tracking criminals
down, Birger is regularly employed by the town guard.  He works for cheap,
because he truly enjoys his profession.  His face and arms are covered in
outlandish, glowing tattoos, rumors have it that they are inbued with
magical properties, allowing him to see beyond normal human sight and giving
him an acute sense of smell.  Judging from his brutish apperance, though,
you suspect that a forefather of his was an orc, or worse.  His hair is
green and browning, if that is his natural hair color you dare not guess, it
might as well be dirt and moss.  His nose bulges out of his face like as if
he was hit really hard in the back of the head as a child.  The eyes are
small sit far apart, probably to enable him to see past the warty monster of
a nose.  His sinewy frame is held up by a crooked back which he seems to
hang from like a scarecrow.  Dragging his feet along as he shuffles along
Cumberland Avenue his darting eyes suspiciously search the streets for shady
individuals.

fountain~
A bronze statue of King Devon Dunluce, the powerful man who founded the
Athanmere line, stands boldly atop the back of an enormous beast.  While
Devon's bronze eyes stare sightlessly southwards, towards the castle that
bears his name, the bronze beast rears slightly under his feet.  Water pours
from the mouth and blowhole of the beast, which appears something like a
cross between a giant crocodile and a whale.  The elaborate stone work that
holds the pool of water has been carefully sculpted with stories from the
life of Devon Dunluce.

book~
A magical force keeps you from opening this tattered book,
and the arcane words etched upon its leather cover  are of 
a language you have never seen before, a language you cannot read.
You can still feel the magic emanating from inside its covers,
probably possessing hidden secrets that only Old Man Torun can
decrypt.

`o[`nThe Zoo`o]``
Those who are very new to the city should attempt to venture towards
the east gate (east of the fountain down Cumberland), and south of
Farmer's Square, until they reach Welford Road.  Travelling south down
Welford, watch for signs indicating an Animal Exhibition (check your
map if you get lost), and venture inside  -  the zoo is a nice place
for adventurers to have fun and explore in before attempting to take
their quests out of the city.
 
`o[`cThe Eastern Prairie`o]``                 
After finding your bearings in the city of Thesden, travel east down
Cumberland until you find yourself in Farmer's Square.  From there,
go one south and east, and you will find yourself in the Eastern
Prairie, an excellent place for newcomers to explore and adventure
in.

Poem #1:  From the Library of A Heretic Mage
Deepest dark to darkest dawn
Blackest night the shadowspawn
Heights of power moonlight shed
Raise to life the lifeless dead
Magick flashes wizardry scored
Witches cast and demon's horde
Power meshed the senses heightened
Third eye opens mind enlightened
Death and life become conjoined
Mortal being essence purloined
Nature sits and pauses clearly
Forces act and kill her nearly
Portal opens rift tears wide
Passage way that will no hide
Enter those who seek the power
Weak are those who shrink and cower
Bravely few will dare press on
Death will greet the timid fawn
Challenge three the survivors face
Those who die will die disgraced
Success for one who journey dared
Heralds quiet deign declare
Tongues stand silent how master fared...
.
Poem #2:  Works of the Nomad Shaman
A wisp of wind, a crack of thunder
The peace of the world, torn asunder
Lightning flashes
Burning ashes
Death
Battle rages
Spare the pages
Darkness expands as light grows vague
Bearing the world to new an age
Death
Life anew flashes brightly
Dead are those who fought the mighty
Ashes old spring anew
Forming peace, for us is new
Battle once raged
The pages spared
Who might contest
None have dared
What of children
There are few 
A baby cries
The cock cries two
Destiny
The life that was is no more
None remember the ancient lore
Ages past are long forgotten
Death occurs all too often
Doom
A wisp of wind, a crack of thunder
The peace that was, torn asunder.
.

The Warrior's Guide to Spellcasting
.
This manuscript is intended as a guide to magicking for warriors.  Hopefully
after reading this you will learn how to accomplish some small magics and how
to recognize it.  I myself am already able to set things afire just by 
thinking about it!  [Scribe's note:  Thinking is such a difficult process
for Garrote that he often forgets to hang onto his torch.  He's not too 
bright.]
.
Here is how I have heard you accomplish some of the more common magics of the
land:
`g'invisibility'``
First you must get together the severed head of a dragon (this is reputedly
the reason Kalus wanted all those heads some time ago).
You must then stick the head on a long pole and dance around it, shouting
'YOU CAN'T _SEEE_ ME, NYAH NYAH!' over and over.  After about 10 minutes, 
you should be invisible to most people.  I haven't been able to confirm this 
for 2 reasons:
1)  Most people refuse to acknowledge my presence anyway and
2)  By the time I'm done dancing and shouting there aren't very many
people around any more.
.
`g'mirror'
``This is one of the most powerful spells around, but is surprisingly easy
to cast.  First you need an actual mirror, any mirror will do.  Then you 
stare into the mirror as hard as you can and utter the sacred words, 'Tab
is good, Tab is great!'.  Mirror is not all-powerful, of course... There are
some weapons that break the mirror.  So far, I have found that swords, axes,
daggers, and staffs seem to break the mirror.  There may be more.
.
`g'charm person'``
This powerful spell will get people to obey your every whim!  It is said that
this spell is the next step in the evolution of a popular scroll entitled,
'How To Get The Girl Of Your Dreams In Bed.'  It is definitely a strange one,
it mostly seems to consist of a mage following someone around on his knees 
blubbering, 'PLEASE PLEASE _PLEASE_!'.  
This spell also seems to have a high percentage of failure.

tylar shattered one~
Unwritten
.
No lines seem to stick with me.
No words pour forth from my mind.
The pen stands, left alone.
The cold in me goes unrelieved.
The written word eludes me.
The spoken word unheard.
A cold wind blows,
a chill comes to stay.
A shiver runs through me.
Still I am unable,
communication is destroyed.
Anger sweeps through me,
frustration cools the flames.
The blank page taunts me,
the books mourn me.
Ideas flit through my fingers,
stories go unwritten.
My one true solace escapes me,
my old enemy is upon me.
Weep in frustration,
scream in anger.
It makes no difference,
for the words won'd come,
and the lines won't write.
.
`bShadow's Lament``
.
`aShadows Laugh
as a small child turns to crime,
and yet another life is broken.
.
Shadows Snicker
as child grows to youth
and life becomes without hope.
.
Shadows Sigh
as youth becomes woman,
and turns life away from darkness.
.
Shadows Gloat
as woman is broken,
and life becomes darkness.
.
Shadows Honor
as woman is remade,
and life becomes danger.
.
Shadows Worship
as woman becomes master,
and life becomes Shadow.
.
Shadows Weep
as woman is hung,
and life loses meaning.``

`kVro'ath Weddings, a bit of poesy (and a wandering mind...)
.
The Vro'ath wedding hath come,
and with it celebration not outdone.
Slaves are washed with all preparation,
Creatures are slain for bloody celebration.
The groom doth wait in elf skins so glorious.
The bride is veiled in sidhe wings, luminous.
Monster horrible watch with rapture,
as the bride doth make her capture.
Groom is enslaved, by woman so beautiful.
Oneness is gained by duo so horrible.
World doth shiver, thoughts of young ones so terrible.
But, for now, only the reception doth matter.
Creatures of every species do gather.
Slaves hide for fear of their lives, 
as people do destroy the banquet with delight,
and then the day draws to a close,
and this poet's mind does begin to doze. 
The cleaup crews are set loose upon the grounds,
to clean the land and scrub the ground.
From the honeymoon tent can be heard,
whips and screams of delight so blurred.
As such goes a wedding, of two creatures so evil.
But what a way to pass the time,
as wakefulness dwindles.``

overview~
In the realm of Exodus, you will find that there are both rules and laws to follow.
Rules govern the game play of Exodus and are not open to role play.  They are here to
make the game balanced, fun to play and fair to everyone that plays here.
Laws are based on role play and if you break a law you may or may not suffer a
penalty.  Some laws include "Mages may not cast charm in Thesden or rooms personally
owned by players on any mobs or players, You may not kill another player in Thesden or
a personally owned room, You may not steal from a another player or a Shop... etc."
 
For more information regarding Exodus rules, please type 'Rules'.

The Passive Nature of Strength
by Unti Vorvoral
.
My personal search has led me far afield and it is good to finally come
home. As many of you know, I stated life on a definitely shaky
footing. With the help of spiritual and temporal guides, I have now
reached an equilibrium well suited to me.
.
Strength can be measured in many ways and none can be said to be any 
less or more valid than any other. My personal measure of strength is 
that pertaining to strength of character and strength of resolve.
Basically, I have chosen to walk one path and will not be diverted from 
this path as long as I shall live.
.
I have accepted and embraced three key resolutions by which I live:
To do no harm.
To attempt to resolve conflict through dialogue
To attempt to convince others that Passivism is a valid and desirable code of
living.
.
Doing No Harm:
.
As a youth I believed, as most youths do, that strength of a physical
nature was a paramount strength. It is easily recognized that pain or
humiliation are never pleasurable. It is also easily recognized that
all creatures have basic primal instincts to defend themselves. The
realization of the truth of the two previous statements lends to an 
understanding of why any given individual would defend themselves in
the direct manner of the physical. The least thought is required to 
lash out and wound the thing or individual that has harmed oneself.
.
As I have walked my path, I have come to the realization that the
easiest solution to any given problem is not necessarily the best
solution to that problem. Deep thought is needed to find lasting 
solutions. After deep thought on the issues of harm, I have come to the 
conclusion that by harming others, I also harm myself. I understand 
that some might find this hard to understand so I will try to elaborate.
.
There are several reasons that harming others is actually harming
oneself. I have listed four below and although this list is not
complete, I feel it does give some sort of illustration of my point of
view. I have listed them thus:
If one confronts an antagonist on a one on one footing, there is a 
possible chance of resolution. When larger groups of individuals are
involved, such as Associations, Gangs, and Clans, then there is a very
real potential to inflame the situation. If one's group of associates
is smaller than the group of the opposition, real trouble can result.
As the scale of any given altercation grows, individuals innocent of the 
original action inevitably are dragged into the conflict. This is 
never desirable, as the measure of harm in these cases has grown 
exponentially in all cases.
.
The authorities take a dim view of public acts of violence. To commit 
any aggressive action against another will no doubt bring down their 
wrath. The authorities inevitably engage in acts of violence in the 
apprehension of perceived felons and thus the harm done is compounded
once again.
.
I come to my last example. I feel this is the paramount reason for not
engaging in a physically violent act. It is my firm belief that as a
pacifist, I harm myself when I harm others. This harm is not physical 
in nature. It strikes somewhere very different indeed. It harms the
mind and it harms the soul. I will not say that I have never committed
a violent act. I will say that every one of those acts I now regret.
Some are years past, but I still feel the pain as if it were yesterday.
When the soul bleeds, it is almost impossible to staunch the flow from
that wound.
.
While the avoidance of violent acts is my desire and I strive towards
the goal of a totally nonviolent existence, I also realize that not all
individuals can live fully by this code. One has to balance the harm
done one by the initial assault on oneself against the harm of not
acting to correct the situation. Sometimes a direct physical reaction 
is needed. In these cases, I urge those persons who arrive at the 
decision to retaliate to arrive there after a great deal of thought.
Weigh and balance your options and the harm you will do to both 
opponent and self when you act. Never act from rage and never act
rashly. Travel the path which results in the least harm for all.

words~
Lord of the people, prince Laos loved by all,
His words impersonal til his heart took call,
She in the mud, her voice honey jewelled,
His carriage bedecked in gold, he raced home,
The squires all flushed and their opinion was not alone,
His mother refused, his father shouted walking to and fro,
So into the night this trek, this journey on which he did go,
Down the towers and turrets, wearing but rags and a blade,
To the beloved farmer's daughter he went to aid,
For seven years he worked, asking only room and board,
Til in his entourage travelled a lord,
Lord Elrion came, his party strewn with gold,
Asking daughter Mallion to venture to his castle,
Laos saw the look in her eyes and was cut to the quick,
For one whole fortnight his fear and cries pled him sick,
On the day that he raised with his single long knife,
They agreed to duel, Laos his dagger, and Elrion blade-like scythe,
To the corners they walked, then both in the center in a flash, 
Baring teeth did they each dash,
But truly had Laos honed his skills, with his knife in hand,
His stabs deep and his spins grand,
They fought all night and only Elrion missed,
In the morn though it was the bloodied Elrion Mallion ran to kiss,
Laos stabbed himself in the chest with a single quick dart,
His last dying words said to the best of his art,
"If you have stone skin then you have a golden heart"
And after Elrion left her, and she was aloneall that she kept and
Cherished were ...
The words he spoke.

This is the beginning of the end:
The beginning of the night, of shadows;
End of the light and of days.
I call upon the dark, the twisted at heart,
I summon you thee, and yee will comply.
I see nothing but fear, I sense hate in your eyes.
You are either with us my dear,
Or you'll die with them,
Being the last day you see the light.
Light will flicker, they will die,
Shadows will thicken, night will come by
For is the beginning of the end:
The beginning of the night, of shadows;
End of the light and of days.

`dThere is a legend of a magical `istone`d that glows and flickers with light.  It is
said that this stone originally belonged to the `kGoddess of the Enternal Flame`d,
who kept it within a magical `bstone box`d that only she possessed the key to open.
This box was very precious to her because the box itself contained some of her
life essence.  In time, the `ibox`d was stolen by a jealous `kfire spirit`d who was
convinced he could unlock the `bbox`d and possess the `istone`d.  The `kspirit`d stole
the `bbox`d from the `kGoddess`d and fled and has hidden himself in an ancient tomb,
locked away for eons in a distant desert.  Only one `jkey`d is said to have the
ability to open the tomb where the `kfire spirit`d is hidden.  For centuries, this
key was lost, and the story faded into legend.  Then, only a few decades ago,
the `jkey`d was uncovered by a great hero named Armanos.
`d
Armanos was a mighty warrior who fought for Lord Eyunel in the years before
the great Vro'ath seige upon his castle.  Eyunel had dispatched Armanos on a
quest to return the `istone`d to the `kGoddess`d to win her favor.  Armanos searched
for years for the `jkey`d to the tomb, finally locating it.  As he returned to
tell Lord Eyunel of his discovery, he was ambushed by a garrison of Vro'ath
warriors, who would become the vanguard of the seige against Eyunel's castle.
When Armanos was laid to rest, the ancient `jkey`d was never recovered, but his
ghost is said to haunt his gravesite even now.  Supposedly, with his dying
breath, Armanos swore a curse upon the `jkey`d that if anyone else tried to claim
it, the `jkey`d could quickly srumble to dust, so that anyone who took the `jkey`d in
search of treasure would only have a few days at the most to unlock the tomb.

Then she will be able to reward you for the quest.
`o
If you get turned around or confused while dealign with the Goddess, just say
"start over" when you are in the room and you can begin your conversation again.``

who kept it within a magical `bstone box`d that only she possessed the key to open.
This box was very precious to her because the box itself contained some of her
life essence.  In time, the `ibox`d was stolen by a jealous `kfire spirit`d who was
convinced he could unlock the `bbox`d and possess the `istone`d.  The `kspirit`d stole
the `bbox`d from the `kGoddess`d and fled and has hidden himself in an ancient tomb,
locked away for eons in a distant desert.  Only one `jkey`d is said to have the
ability to open the tomb where the `kfire spirit`d is hidden.  For centuries, this
key was lost, and the story faded into legend.  Then, only a few decades ago,
the `jkey`d was uncovered by a great hero named Armanos.
`d
Armanos was a mighty warrior who fought for Lord Eyunel in the years before
the great Vro'ath seige upon his castle.  Eyunel had dispatched Armanos on a
quest to return the `istone`d to the `kGoddess`d to win her favor.  Armanos searched
for years for the `jkey`d to the tomb, finally locating it.  As he returned to
tell Lord Eyunel of his discovery, he was ambushed by a garrison of Vro'ath
warriors, who would become the vanguard of the seige against Eyunel's castle.
When Armanos was laid to rest, the ancient `jkey`d was never recovered, but his
ghost is said to haunt his gravesite even now.  Supposedly, with his dying
breath, Armanos swore a curse upon the `jkey`d that if anyone else tried to claim
it, the `jkey`d could quickly srumble to dust, so that anyone who took the `jkey`d in
search of treasure would only have a few days at the most to unlock the tomb.

marque~
The marque of nobility is an official document which declares a wish to
reject the status of nobility given to one.  Any noble who wants to reject
his or her nobility needs only to acquire this marque and present it to Lord
Istian.  At that point, the person's nobility is rescinded officially.  Be
warned, though, because once this action is taken, it may not be easy to
regain the aforementioned nobility, so proceed with caution.

Elm Square~
This square marks the intersection of Cumberland Avenue (east/west) and
Crowland Street (North/South).  At the center stands a withered old elm
tree, dead branches and names of a hundred sweethearts carved into its
trunk.  Two deep ruts run from the east side to the south side, showing the
path of the wagons from east Thesden to the docks to the south.

This quiet little street is home to a number of slightly run-down homes

square, to the north, however, only a few people walk unhurriedly.

Crowland Street~
You walk along a quiet back street away from the din of the main squares.
Ramshackle houses stand along the road, only some of which appear to be
occupied.  Besides the fact that the street is unpaved and covered in dirt,
it appears surprisingly well kept, raked and free of trash.

Crowland Street~
The roads end in a short wooden pier which projects out over the murky
waters of the Severn River.  The pier has a rotted wooden fence, which you
could easily jump over and dive down into the river, though the stench makes
you think that might not be a great idea.

Severn River~
You are above the dark, swirling waters of the Severn River.  You could
dive under the murky waters, though the vague stench of sewage makes you
think you might regret it.  The river flows from the north, through a rusted
grate at the bottom of the city wall.

In the River~
You are swimming in the foul waters of the Severn River.  The waters are
murky and dark, you find it quite difficult to see anything.  The swirling
waters carry some small fish, and much else not nearly so harmless.

Crowland Street~
This street leads from the Thesden docks to the south to Elm square just
to the north.  A thick layer of dust and gravel coat the ground, clouds of
dust occasionally rising as a merchant wagon moves by quickly.  Grim-faced
peasants mix with the dock workers and merchants, all carefully avoiding eye
contact.

Crowland Street~
Increasing amounts of mud sticks to your boots as you walk along this
road, winding past merchants headed to the docks and poor locals looking for
a coin.  A small sign outside a building to the east reads, `d'Midnight's
Smoke Shop'`e.

Crowland Street~
The smell of salt water and old fish drifts through the air from the
docks not far off to the south.  Merchants wagons create clouds of dust in
the air as they roll past to load cargo from the ships and bring it back to
the center of town.

Crowland Street~
The smell of sea air is quite strong this close to the docks to the
south, getting milder to the north.  A steady flow of merchants, wagons, and
burly guards move along to and from the docks carrying goods back to the
main part of town.

Dock Street and Crowland Street~
A steady breeze rolls in off the bay, carrying with it salty air and the
smell of fish.  Wide sailed sloops and smaller ships can be seen floating
out in the bay, heading out to sea or coming into port.  Dock Street
continues to the east and west, Crowland Street leads off to the north.

Small waves, cresting with the slightest white froth, lap at the base of
the long wooden piers where ships of all sizes are docked.  The smell of
salt and sea air is strong here, carried on a light breeze.  Dock street

Dock Street~
Small waves, cresting with the slightest white froth, lap at the base of
the long wooden piers where ships of all sizes are docked.  The smell of
salt and sea air is strong here, carried on a light breeze.  The street ends
in rotten wooden fence on a platform which overlooks the Severn River
emptying into the bay.

Dock Street~
The salty air of the sea leaves your throat feeling horribly dry, luckily
`d'The Rusty Nail Tavern'`l is just to the north.  The docks continue to the
west, to the east meeting up with merchants coming off Crowland street.  A
long wooden pier runs off to the south.

Dock Street~
A light breeze blows steadily, carrying the scents of the sea from the
bay across the ships floating by the wooden docks.  Fewer ships are docked
on this west end of the street, even fewer further west.  Small waves roll
in from the bay, causing the ships to rise and fall steadily.  A neatly
painted sign above a building to the north reads `dAsrac's Ships.  ``

fish or crab to eat.  The docks can be seen off to the east, and a narrow,

Buildings, wood rotted and partially collapsed, filled with far too many
people or none at all, line this narrow street.  No one meets your eyes,
most concentrate solely on where their feet are headed and on the location
of their meagre purses.  You can hear the sound of waves crashing just to
the south.

curtains drawn along the sides.  Trash lies discarded randomly over the dirt
street, blowing around with the breeze.  The few people in the street move

This is clearly no one of the wealthier sections of Thesden, the
buildings mostly look like they don't have long left in this world and the
locals don't look much better off.  You can see the towers of the west gate
just to the north.

The thick wooden gates of Thesden are to the west, flanked by two tall
rounded towers.  Only a few travelers or merchants occasionally come through
the gates, heading quickly to the east side of town along Cumberland.  A
narrow, dark street crosses here, heading off to the north and south.

Falstaff Street~
It's difficult to feel safe in this corner of Thesden, where footsteps
seem to echo ominously on this empty street.  The occasional disquieting
scream of an alley cat or a person breaks the quiet of the street, where the
only other sounds are whispers from alleys and the soft shuffle of feet
along cobbles.  To the north is Falstaff Square, known as the slimy
underbelly of Thesden.

South Falstaff Square~
This looks like the kind of place your mother warned you to stay away
from.  Tell-tale rust red stains spatter the grey stones of this square,
which might once have been as beautiful as Thesden's other squares.  Now,
however, the statues are broken and covered in graffiti, and the fountains
don't work.  You suspect the town militia doesn't see this place much.  A
dark, narrow street leads off to the south.

`o*`k Thesden Council Chambers`o *``~
`lThe`o blinding`k glow`l of your sudden magical transferrence fades from your
vision.  As you look about your new surroundings you see that you are in a
large, rectangular stone room.  From the`i banners`l hanging from the rafters high
above you and from the spectacular view of Thesden laid out before you through
a large, leaded window of diamond-shaped panes, you determine that you are 
somewhere near the top of`a Dunluce Castle`l.  The chamber is bare, except for
the`i c`ko`jl`no`lr`mf`iu`kl`l standards above the long,`d oaken table`l beneath them.  Several
chairs in different shapes and sizes have been set at both sides of the table
and a large, ornate one sits at the table head, before the window.
A massive set of thick, wooden doors with bands of`h iron`l across them stand
cloesd to the south.  A pair of palace guards dressed in`n g`ol`ne`oa`nm`oi`nn`og`h silver`l and
`owhite`l prevent any unauthorized persons from entering or leaving.``

entryway to the east leads to a Donation Room.  To the west, a framed
doorway contains the passageway to many wondrous lands, the Library.
Travellers who are new to Exodus should look manifesto for a few hints to
surviving.

The Docks~
The time-worn wood of the docks creaks and sways slightly with each
footstep.  The masts of ships stand out among a forest of ropes to the east
and west.  A few ships with sails raised pull out heading to the open ocean,
slowly shrinking to white dots on the horizon.

A delicate rainbow of colored light fills this shop from the stained

containers to elaborate designs in color and wrought iron lay neatly
arranged.  A wave of heat and the low roar of the furnaces in the back of
the shop hits you as apprentices scurry about to aid the master
glassblowers.  Near the oldest of the glassblowers, a woman is carefully
creating a stained glass image using `ncolorful`l shards of glass.  ``

leather booties of a baby to the rough leather implements necessary for farm
work.  Upon one wall, an exquisite painting hangs, loving brushstrokes
detailing a misty forest, with a half-glimpsed woman.

The Entrance to Ashton Gardens~
You stand between the ornate iron gates of Ashton Gardens, where the idle
rich come to stroll along the meticulously manicured paths.  Far too grand
for a mere park, the gardens were erected as a living monument to the
deceased Lord Ashton, a great patron of diplomacy and natural beauty.  An
enormous, ancient oak tree stands erect in the center of the park to the
west, its gnarled roots providing home to many creatures and birds.  Lovely
walkways lead through the park to the north and south.

Smooth, grey flagstones act as a path through the neatly trimmed

directions, the stalwart walls of Thesden stand.  Before the southern wall,
a weathered statue of a cleric trying to exorcise a demon from a bard, has
been erected.  The base of the statue has been inscribed with the words
"Through preperation and dilligence shall we be strong."

tiny white pebbles under your feet.  The fragrance and pollen of exotic
flora imported from distant lands fill the air.  Sheared fragile grass
alongside the walkway discourage you from traipsing through the gardens. 
The path leads west into the gardens, and south back to the entrance.

Ashton Gardens~
The Thesdian nobles are unashamed of their corpulent wealth and their
indulgent comforts, and it shows in the vanity of these gardens.  Where
other areas of the city might not see light, the sun shines down rapturously
upon these blessed trees, breathing life into cherry blossoms piled on top
of wiry branches.  The gravel path under you shines like a million silver
jewels that in a distant dream you remember lead you to some tranquil haven.

The path that circles the Great Oak are pebbles that line the perfectly
upright grasses of the gardens.  As you walk by, they appear to stand more
rigid, as if to come to attention.  A bounty of nuts and cones lay strewn
upon the ground, a glorious feeding ground for the chipmunks and squirrels
that make their home in the tree's thick knotted branches.  The
expansiveness of the oak tree provides shade and shelter for the people who
come to enjoy the peacefulness of the park.

Untempered by the heavy clodding of wagons and packhorses, and the hectic
travel of harried traders, Ashton Gardens has been preserved as a natural
sanctuary.  Imported from across the sea, several perinthen trees stand here
regally bearing their bold lavender and teal blossoms.  The cooing of pure
white doves comes from the nearby grass, where they stroll about
contentedly, welcoming you into their abode.

You are strolling through Ashton Gardens, the rush of the city so far

unique and pampered.  Nearby, ducks and swans swim contentedly in a small
pond.  The path winds its way around the Great Oak tree, under a peaceful
canopy of branches.

Though you try not to disturb the denizens of this park, the gravelly
path crackles unforgivingly under your feet, causing a robin to raise her
head in alarm.  The soft velvety petals of magenta violets adorn the
shrubbery to the northwestern border of the park, shielding the heavy iron
fence from view.  Carefully tended by Thesdian gardeners specially trained
in the art of flora, Ashton Gardens flourishes in an otherwise grim city. 
The iron fisted Lords of Thesden permit themselves this only spot of beauty.

The greenery all around you is swathed in a golden light, making the
silken leaves of eucalyptus trees unfurl dazzlingly from the rest of the
shrubbery.  The trees lining the western border of the gardens are laden
with sun ripened fruits.  These fruits, of course, have never seen the
wooden crates of Thesden's open air market.  They are plucked by careful
hands and placed in golden baskets on the dining tables of the most
discriminating nobles.  The Great Oak rises to the east, the centerpiece of
the gardens.

A Practice Room~
In some lands, when a thief has been caught stealing, the offender's
hands are cut off.  When a thief fails an assassination attempt, more often
than not, the thief has to begin to worry about his or her life.  This
small, dark chamber has been created and added to by generations of thieves
as a place where those who wish to practice the art of thievery may do so in
a relatively safe and quiet place.  As a testament to this, several wrinkled
parchments have been hung upon the walls illustrating the best places in
which members of different races may be backstabbed in the most effective
fashion.  A wooden target upon one of the walls is covered with countless
scoring marks from thrown blades and darts.  Various daggers of different
sizes and shapes as well as other unrecognizable, yet dangerous looking
instruments, lay scattered across some crates and crude tables in the
shadows.

the center of the room upon a wooden pole, a dummy of straw has been hung on which
combative songs and skills can be practiced.

questionable.  A wide window allows a view of all of Devon Square to the

The Spiral Stair~
A small landing interrupts a set of stairs that lead up and down.  The
somber walls are undecorated, still plain black and without markings.  A
thick, steel door stands to the west and a narrow archway leads off to the
north.  Next to the steel door, a note reads `b'CAUTION: Apprentices May
`bOnly Use This Room When Supervised'.``

The Chambers of the Teacher~
A large chalkboard hangs on the far wall of this small room, marked with
obscure runes and symbols.  Only one uncomfortable chair sits across from
the teacher's desk, he only accepts one pupil at a time, other forced to

The Practice Room~
The walls of this room have a very different character from the rest of
the building, made of a strange blue-black metallic substance.  This inside
of the door is covered in the same metal, meant to absorb any extraneous
magic.  The purpose of this room is to provide the apprentices a place to
practice where they aren't putting anyone's life at risk, save perhaps their
own.

The Meditation Chamber~
This small, plain room is solid black.  The walls and ceiling are
ebony-hued stone, while a thin padded mat, pitch black, covers the floor. 
The scent of incense fills the air, though none is visibly burning.  The hum
of magical energy seems to throb rhythmically, like the flow of blood in
veins, encouraging meditation and mental relaxation.

None of the inventory is visible, only a printed item and price list on the

Training Yard~
A stone wall surrounds this wide yard, blocking pedestrians from seeing
or distracting the young knights in training.  While all are welcome to
practice their skills on the dummies, even the most impatient warrior must
give the guild staff enough time to put them back together when the dummies
have been demolished.  The yard continues to the east.

The Acolyte's Chambers~
This small chapel has been designed as a classroom for aspiring clerics. 
There is a small altar at the front, where the teacher stands to preach to
the young acolytes.  Several tile frescoes line the walls, depicting moral
lessons important for the master's pupils.  A heavy oaken door to the south
leads to a small, secluded courtyard where acolytes learn how to defend
themselves from those that would lead them astray.

a large obelisk at its center.  The obelisk has a silver triskelion set into
the stone, shining starkly bright against the black background.  The floor
is 3 solid pieces of stone, the seams of the center on making a perfect
square in front of the obelisk.  A small unmarked door is set into the wall
to the east.

Dirt Road Outside the Gates~
A narrow dirt road, barely wide enough to let a wagon pass, leads off
into the woods to the west.  To the east, two towers stand on either side of
the gates of Thesden.  You can hear the rumble of the crowds pouring out of
the town and disturbing the peace of this quiet forest.  A short path to the
north leads to a small clearing.

It is difficult to tell if this chamber was carved by human hands or by
force of nature.  Rounded stones make comfortable seats throughout the room,
and a tiny waterfall pours out of the wall, sparkling in the faint light.  A
short passage leads to the north and west.  The only other exit is back
through the secret door to the east.

A Humble Abode (Reserved by Iverath)~
You walk into a humble abode, ducking your head to avoid bashing it
against the low ceiling.  This home boasts no windows, and would be
unbearably hot in the summer if not for the thick stone walls' remarkable
retention of cool air.  The home is sparsely furnished, providing its owner
with the simplest of comforts.  Judging from the various imported sundries,
you surmise that this house belongs to one who has travelled the eastern
seas, or at least belongs to someone who knows such intrepid adventurers.

The ocean chruns on, sea-foam and shells, driving skelatal once-fish and
the glassy-crystal remains of a jellyfish broken by a storm.  The waters
swirl on, salty and dark, grinding to sand the last stones of what once was
a mountain.  The cycle rolls on, a clump of greenish seaweed riding the
froth of a wave from the other side of the world.  A perpetual inventory of
the sea, awash with debris, alive and dead, inevitable and silent.

A Humble Abode~
Mostly bare and sparsely furnished, the most alluring embellishments of
this humble home are the streaks of light coursing in through the thatched
straw roof.  The illumination creates strange shapes of the shadows,
elongating the corners of the room, and giving the house a complexity far
greater than its reality.  Hidden in the peaceful proximity of Cathedral
Square, the family that lives here, most likely aspiring apprentices, enjoys
an amiable existence.

Asrac's work does not come cheap, but is famed for being able to hold up in

put my heart and soul into each one.  If you take care of them, they will
take care of you.  When your rental period is over, which is based on the
current availability of water craft, I will have the craft rented to you
located (by magical means) and transported back to the Thesden docks.  The

two huge masts dominating the center.  The ship is stable as the waves roll
underneath, barely moving at all.  A few short steps lead north to the fore
deck, to the front mast.

The Helm of the Frigate 'Justice'~
This square-rigged ship has a very low draft, riding quite deep in the
waves.  The deck is nearly fifty paces long, ropes and sails criss crossing
above.  The ship moves swiftly through the water, surprisingly fast for so
large a vessel.  You stand at the helm, before the wheel of the vessel.  The
deck continues to the north and south, and the crew quarter's are below.

The Docks~
The time-worn wood of the docks creaks and sways slightly with each
footstep.  The masts of ships stand out among a forest of ropes to the east
and west.  A few ships with sails raised pull out heading to the open ocean,
slowly shrinking to white dots on the horizon.

The larger ships, frigates and merchantmen, are docked here in the
deeper waters of Colwyn Bay.  Sailors move along the docks here, hanging
from ropes and loading cargo into their craft.  The waters of the bay flow
under the ships to the east and to the west.

Cell Hallway~
The narrow stone staircase ends into this bleak hallway.  The walls and
floor are cold grey stone, each footsteps echo down its length off the steel
doors of the prison cells to the north and south.  No one enters this place
without reason, and when you find yourself here, your future is dismal and
dim.

Kraft and Eddard's Memorial Jail Cell~
These cells are reserved for the worst and most hated criminals, too
small to live in for any length of time.  The ceiling is low, so low that it
is impossible to stand, and the walls are too narrow to lie down.  Only a
tiny sliver of light reaches inside, making the darkness not quite entirely
black, everything appears as blurred greys.  The heavy steel door is
windowless and imposing.  A small, dirty mirror hangs crookedly on one wall.

A dingy and dirty little mirror hangs on a wall here.  Looking into it,
you draw back in alarm, for the face that gazes back at you is a model of
depravity and maliciousness.  With a sinking heart, you also realize it
looks familiar - too familiar - it's you!

As you gaze into this filthy little mirror, you frown at the unhappy and
cruel face that returns your gaze.  Is that really you?  Have you truly
fallen so far?  Once you had been proud of yourself, but as you gaze into
the mirror, you realize there's not really anything to be all that proud of
at this point.  Not much to hope for, either.

as surely as the cell saps your hope.  Only a narrow shaft of light comes

endless hours of your lonely days.  A muck-encrusted mirror hangs forlornly
on one wall.

Filth and who knows what else coats this tiny mirror so much that you
can't even see yourself in it.  You rub the mirror with your shirt sleeve,
noting with disgust that the crap is now on you, and gaze into the mirror. 
Any hope you have fades, as you see yourself at your most unflattering,
every petty and not so petty sin tracing a line or otherwise leaving a mark
on you.  You wish you had left the mirror dirty and not looked.

Beyond the thick iron cylinders, you can see an assortment of caged entities,
all roaming behind gleaming steel bars.  The unkempt man in the stall smiles
wickedly as you approach, awaiting yet another sale.

Arches of olive and emerald plantlife send lazy tendrils dangling down
to brush your forehead lightly as you walk along here.  Strikingly bright
birds dive through gaps in the canopy, aiming for dull brown and green
insects on the tiled floor below.  As you walk through the shaded greenery,
the cacophony of animal howls and chirps makes you wonder how peaceful
this spot would be if it weren't for the constant wails.

A tiled promenade~
Thick squares of dusk-streaked limestone wobble slightly within their
tar encasement as you step across them and make your way along the
promenade.  A thin layer of clear glaze makes the light from artificial
sources above you dissolve into a radiance that seems to emerge
unhindered from the ground itself.  The spectacle of wild animals in
every direction almost makes you lose your footing as you continue along
on the unstable path.

Bluish-green leaves dangle from the branches of two polarized trees that
touch briefly in the air above you.  Winding stems from long-necked
flowers meet with thin twigs, exploding into various colors of flower
blossoms and fruits at their termination.  The ends of tiny vines and
ferns brush the top of your head as you wander underneath the great
canopy, making you look up occasionally for an unseen foe.

A tiled promenade~
Gray tar holds huge blocks of craggy white stone to the soft peat ground,
creating a slightly shaky but decently stable floor for you to stroll
across.  In the distance in every direction you can see tents and cages
filled with howling creatures of all types.  The air around you seems
stagnant with the smell of captured wildlife and greenery, causing you
to wrinkle your nose slightly as you amble about.

A humid trail around a murky pit~
Soft peat outlines an even softer trail of dampened soil and gravel here,
and dips off to merge with a moss-green pool of water and debris.  Odd
shapes linger about under the pit water's surface, gliding silently
back and forth while not revealing their entire form.  A yellowed eye
emerges from the filth as you watch the water's surface, and stares at
you briefly before sinking into the depths once more.

Center of the exhibition~
You now stand in the center of the animal exhibition sprawl.  The tiled
walkway extends in all directions, leading to tents in the distance, and
animal pens in almost every direction.  A cold gust of wind washes over
you as you pass through the middle of the display, reminding you of the
differing climactic conditions that need to be reproduced in order to keep
some of the animals here alive.  Swinging steel gates offer a quick `bexit`l`l to
Welford Road from here should one wish to leave the zoo.

The slight glaze that covers the limestone bricks makes it easy to lose
your footing as you walk along the wobbly stone platform that houses the
main area of the exhibition.  Striped tents can be seen off in the distance,
and an assortment of pits and cages lie in every direction.  Near the
iron gates on the horizon you can see a U-shaped canopy circling the area,
and what seems to be a roost for birds and insects.

A poolside ledge~
Grains of shining golden sand sparkle on the dust-caked slabs of rock that
sit overlooking the oval body of clear blue water.  Surrounding the pool
is an assortment of red and yellow rocks, that act as barriers to the
amphibious creatures that reside within it.  Within the crystal waters you
can see various lifeforms paddling about underneath, and diving into
hidden coves under the surface.

A shelf made of pale yellow rock juts out over an elliptical pool of

others hibernate solemnly underneath the rock.  Surrounding the pool
are groups of fire-colored rocks, keeping the inhabitants of the area
enclosed within.

Dark brown soil bulges in deformed spherical domes, creating a miniature
hill range that makes travelling this path a bit more difficult than walking
on hardened ground.  Pools of gravel fill the ruts in the ground, an obvious
attempt to stabilize the path by the owners of the exhibition.  Off in the
distance north, you can see the flaps of huge striped tents waving in the
wind.

unbroken pillars of cloth only marred by the thin metal catches at the
base that mark the doorflaps of the tent.  You can hear the drone of
wailing animals and screaming people echoing out from the inside of the
edifice.  Slabs of limestone form a promenade around you, and animal
cages lie in almost every direction.

The huge striped tents that tower above you seem to sway slowly as a hard
breeze hits their flanks, giving the illusion of faint movement.  Steel
rods jut out from the ground at every corner of the squarish tent, suspending
the cloth structure high in the air above you.  Behind you, the sprawl
of the limestone promenade spreads out.

Glassy black waters roll over you as you submerge into the dark pit,
creating ripples that attract all sorts of lifeforms from the vague
darkness.  Swirls of debris hinder your vision as you attempt to navigate
through the darkness, clouding the surrounding terrain.  As you hover
around in the obscurity, you hear a muffled thrashing coming from
above...

Ripples of clouded ebony water fill your vision in every direction,
making it difficult to see past the chunks of debris that litter the

that seem to fill the sticky ground, poking eyestalks out of the murk
to stare up at you.  Above you, a patch of damp ground encircles the
dirty pool, offering a way out should you choose to leave.

The slanted canvas walls of the tent house a clean wooden platform filled

types.  Oats and grain are scattered in piles around the floor, encasing
large slabs of meat and shielding them from casual insect infestation.
To the south you can see a collection of tiny animals, and to the west
lies the promenade.

as you pass, and tiny claws reach up out of the pits to grab at your
ankles, searching for food.

Inside the simian cage~
Drooping tropical trees fill the corner of this oak and bamboo cage, which
seems to be held to the ground with a limestone brick and tar foundation.
Artificial tree branches extend from the sides, allowing the near-sentient
inhabitants to swing freely about without any fear of plummeting to the
floor below because of low tolerance.  Outside of the cage, you can see the
sprawl of the promenade, with tents off in the distance.

Tall blades of emerald grass sway in the slight breeze, almost perfectly
simulating the environment that the inhabitants of this cage know as home.
A slot at the front of the cage allows feeders to throw in meat and grain
without actually having to set foot inside -- this has to be one of the
most dangerous cages in the entire exhibition.  Outside, huge colored tents
tower off into the sky, making your entrapment here seem even worse.

giving the monkeys something to stare at and play with in their fits of
immense, violent boredom.  Below you and outside the cage you can see a
beautiful pool surrounded by reddish colored rocks, and closer, a huge

Wooden bars extend from spiralling holes carved into the base of the

extend from 5 of the bars, trailing ropes upwards to a base outside
of the cage.  Thin reed levers extend from the floor of the platform,
connected to pulley-ropes leading outwards.

Torn scraps of animal flesh mar the rocky walls of this deep, disgusting
pit that extends upwards and connects with the zoo above.  Pools of fresh
blood mix with stagnant clotted pools of blood that leak from the ripped
remains of several scattered corpses around the room.  Dark shadows well
in every corner, and out of one of them you can see three blinking eyes...

Murk Memorial Library~
`hFunded by generous benefactors and patrons, this beautiful alcove has
been erected here, adjoining the stately Thesden Town Hall.  Glorious wooden
arches frame the pristine glass windows that face the busy street outside,
creating an enclave for scholars and visitors alike.  Plants hang from the
rafters and potted trees embellish the corners of this room, lending the
library the ambience of a comfortable study.  Rows of books, some leather
bound, some creased with love, line the shelves against the wall.

Angel Juliette
 
I was sitting on a beach, with my toes in the sand...
Waves lapping at my feet
Wind is whispering in my ear...
Tapping my fingers to a different beat.
There you are, walking down the beach...
Silk clinging to your skin
I look up from where I'm sitting
You fill my mind with sin
I've been touched.. By an angel
I've been touched and my mind is reeling.
I've been touched... by an angel
Can you know what i'm feeling? 
.
By Kosmo El Rangero, Cheese Dragon.

This small, spartan office is largely undecorated, save for the two
silver lances that cross over the silver triskelion of the holy order. 
Behind a large, unlovely desk and a comfortable padded chair, the lord of

You enter into a large shrine adorned with markings of the powerful
god`b Ne'Shajh`l.  At the center of the room is`a Hin'Grak`l studying an ancient
tome intently.  The walls of the room are covered by shelves filled with
books and chests containing powerful knowledge and artifacts.  The room is so
cluttered that one could hardly move through it, and the air is filled with
the penetrating stench of evil, but curiosity and the unquenchable thirst for
power draws you further in.

This room is filled with all sorts of trinkets gathered by Morian during his many
years of life.  The shelves line the room from wall to wall, each with a different
set of items, all somehow alike but unique at the same time.  Among the items on
the shelves are "Nudie Pictures of Cailet and Murk" and the "Plunger of Depravity".
A glass case lies in the middle of the room, storing the most powerful of items.

The Able Ranger~
You have to duck your head as you pass beneath the roots from a tree
above, which hang down through the ceiling.  When you stand up again, you
find yourself in a small shop beneath the Ranger guild.  An aged syvin plies
his wares here, retired from a long career tracking in the woods and wild
lands of the world.

`aSmall `ks`ou`kn`ob`ke`oa`km`os `amake their way through intricate slits
in the old carved storeroom.  Old `dbarrels `aof rotten food litter the
floor.  `aWhile once a place for guards to rest during breaks and enjoy a
pipe of tobacco while eating and sharing a story, it is now a gloomy and
dark place, long gone are the sounds of laughter, the smell of tobacco smoke
rising into the air, `aand the smells of roast mutton being slowly cooked
over a huge pit of flames.  Among the barrels are also small chests, the
outfit of the guard which once stayed in the tower.  `aA decrepit ranger
eyes you from the corner of the room, a one handed haggard looking thing,
before finally nodding and tossing you the keys before laying back down in
his solitary prison.  ``

`i@`c}-'-,--`k Greenwood Clan Equipment Depot`c --,-'-{`i@``~
Leaving behind the hustle and bustle of the teeming city, this pleasant nature
setting breathes out an aura of peace and warmth.  High panels of rare woods
glow with a burnished light.  The red stone floor radiates a cool feeling.  Is
that the scent of a tranquil lake and the chirping of crickets in the background?
High up on the walls of this shop, sit eight portraits of the most powerful rangers
in existence.  The elderly shopkeeper turns around and catches your eye... perhaps
he is one of those awe-inspiring people.  Perhaps you, too, will be one.

`lStepping through an inperceptable door in the wall of the torture
chamber, you emerge in a small room plastered with wanted posters, some
faded beyond recognition, some freshly glued in place.  Against one wall is
a large bench, covered in various implements of death and mayhem.  A
grinding wheel and small forge is set up nearby, and various body parts from
Vro'ath, Human, and Sidhe alike are piled like cordwood in a large box in
the corner.  Clive, betrayer of Parlous, has been charmed, and is forced to
pay for his transgressions by making and repairing the weapons and equipment
available here.  ``

Tropical fish and eels are visible through the opacity of the bubble you are

`lOnce an often visited "love nest" run by Gillian herself, this skeleton
of a room, is nothing like it used to be.  No soft beds or satin sheets.  No
woven carpets or silken tapestries.  All that is left is a roof and two
walls, one to the east and the other to the west.  The glass in the window
frames was destroyed long ago by either children with rocks, or heavy blind
birds.  Through the chimney of`b the Pub`l you hear drunken discussions of
the partons.  Now and then you hear Gillian's laugh, which can only be
described as a kind of high-pitched neighing.  ``

Cows, sheep and pigs make a terrible noise as they stare panicky at the
very dead chunks of meat that was once their relatives.  They are kept in
check by iron cages, leaving them no choice except to eat, poo, and wait for
their time to get slaughtered.  You notice a small hole up on the north
wall, it must be for ventilation, it looks like a person could fit through
that hole, but how would anyone get up there?

This shack looks rather normal, for a butcher's shop.  Too bad that it's
NOT a butcher's shop but a sawbones shack.  Grim saws and knives hang on the
walls, and for some reason you don't spot any bandages...  The steel
examination table at the back wall is dyed black from blood, and the closest
wall and floor are splattered with, what you think must be, blood too.  As
you look closer, you see marks on the wall next to the examination table,
claw marks.  It doesn't appear that Dr.  Giggles supply the luxury of
painkillers or sedatives with his operations.

mansion must be very wealthy, of course it would be hard not to be wealthy,
being King Athanmere's bastard son and all.  A grand staircase leads up to
the second floor where you can see a painting, framed in gold, portraying
Pook throwing gold to the masses.  Servants scurry out of your way, heads
bowed, as you enter the hall.

Thesden home.  A ladder leads up to a trap door in the wooden ceiling.  An
opening in the east wall leads off into the darkness while another roughly
made opening in the north wall leads into a foul-smelling damp tunnel.

Underground passage~
This passageway leads east and west.  Throught the darkness.  You can see
very little in either direction.  A cold draft keeps the hairs on your neck
on end and makes it very difficult to relax.  There is something very evil
about this place.

bubbling potions and the churning wooden gears and squeaking pulleys of

Thesden's Newbie Map Basement~
The basement under Thesden's town hall was opened to the public so that
people new to the world of Exodus could have a reference to find their way
around.  Maps are pinned all over the walls, newer ones covering up part of
older ones.  There are also a number of tables and desks here overflowing
with maps to all kinds of useful places.  A wooden staircase leads back up
to the town hall above.

Books on Races~
This part of the library is where all the books regarding the different
races in the realm of Exodus are housed.  There are many books on the
shelves here that look like they haven't been touched in ages.  There are a
few empty spaces on the shelves, which you feel is kind of odd, since the
library doesn't allow for these books to be checked out.  Wonder where they
are...

The North Gate~
A rotted wooden gate and heavy iron portcullis block the way to the
north.  The portcullis appears to be nearly rusted through, and the worms
visibly chewing through the gate don't inspire confidence in this town's
defenses.  A cobbled muddy road leads to the south into town, and a sturdy
door to the east leads into the guard tower which rises to the city wall.

This weathered cobble-stone street is covered in dirt and mud.  A foul
smelling murky river runs parrelel to the road just to the west.  To the
south the road opens into a wide square.  To the east, a three story
official-looking building rises above the squalor of the surrounding
buildings.  A small dignified sign marks it as the court building of
Thesden.

North Gallows Square~
Wide slate stones cover the ground of this small square.  Few people can
be found here, those that are seem to be in a hurry to get somewhere else or
are gathered in a crowd in the southwest corner.  Larger crowds can be seen
to the east moving along Cumberland Avenue.  To the north stands the Thesden
courthouse, rising three stories above the square.  Its windows face out
onto the gallows and the prison beyond to the south.

This square is considerably more bland than the other squares of the city
no fountains, statues or monuments...  Just a grim gallows to the west.  The
wide paving stones are, however, carefully swept and the whole place has
quite an official feel to it.  Two sturdy wooden doors mark the entrance to
the town militia headquarters to the south.

The Bridge~
This wooden bridge may have once been white, but the years have treated
it badly, fading it to its current grey and brown.  The beams creak under
the strain of feet, though the others on the bridge don't seem much afraid
of it falling.  A foul-smelling, murky green river runs beneath the bridge.

Guard Room~
The prison guard room is quite plain, giving a clear panoptical view of
the cells on this floor.  A narrow stone stairwell leads down to the lower
cells.  A door leads to the guard head quarters to the east, and larger iron
doors open into Gallows Square to the north.

Small Cell~
This small cell has little room to move around, you can get across it in
just 2 steps.  The door is made of iron, with only a small barred window. 
Another small window to the west looks out on the murky waters of the Severn
River.

Large Cell~
This cell looks like it is meant to hold a number of prisoners, though
certainly not comfortably.  A heavy iron door blocks the way to the guard
room to the north, with only a small barred window letting light into the
room.  There are no other windows, each wall is solid stone.

Guard Headquarters~
This is the headquarters of the town guard.  The guard is made up mostly
of locals, trained briefly before they are put on the job.  The guard takes
care of all the minor crimes and day to day keeping of the peace, the major
crimes are left to the king's knights who are not nearly as merciful as the
guardsmen.

Cumberland Avenue~
The main avenue of Thesden is always crowded; heavy merchant wagons
travel along the center in time-worn ruts in the road, travelers and
peasants move along the sides entering shops or begging for a coin.  A
number of strange sounds are coming from the building to the north, outside
hangs a wooden sign which reads `m'The Gem Game'`l.  Another sign, 
painted in dripping crimson paint above the pub to the south reads
`b'Hangman's Tavern'`l reminding you that gallows square is located just to
the west.

As you enter this shop, an interesting mixture of scents, something
between eu du sewage and skunk, but not as pleasant as either, greets your

Loris, a famous traveler in his youth, has settled here to run this shop.

Cumberland Avenue~
This wide street continues across town east to west, filled with
merchants, farmers, peasants and nobles.  The ground is paved in wide slate
stones, grey turned brown from years of dirt and worn in places from
thousands of wagon wheels.  To the south, thick white curtains hang in the
windows of a building, a sign above the door reads, '`fCumberland
Clothier`l'.

Cumberland Avenue~
Buildings made of dark, sturdy woods line the sides of this wide street,
some as tall as four stories.  The lack of waste being thrown from high
windows attests to the fact that Thesden's limited sewer system does reach
these buildings at least.  A steady stream of people flows from Devon's
Square to the east, heading to the west side on Cumberland.

The faint sounds of strings being plucked can be heard as you reach this
corner of the square.  People shuffle past on both sides, heading to stores
or on their way home.  A beautiful building, intricate vines carved into the
wood around the door and windows, stands to the north with an understated
sign which reads `d'Wolsey Furnishings'`l.  The sound of instruments being
inexpertly played comes from `d'Swan's Feather Music'`l to the west.

dark sloped-roof houses, leads off to the north.

Devon Square Center~
The fountain dominates the center of the square, surrounded by several
stone benches mixed among the few old elm trees that have survived.  The
water from the fountain swirls into a pool, in which several large orange
fish swim, searching hungrily for food.  Within the stonework of the square,
an unlabelled map is set between two paving stones, slightly north of the
fountain proper, and well-worn by numerous feet.

Seahan Way~
Dark, sloped-roof buildings line the sides of this quiet street.  A brass
lantern hangs from a black pole, creating a flickering sphere of light in
the night.  During the day, shadows cast from tall buildings don't leave it
much brighter.  Crowds of people fill Devon Square to the south.

Seahan Way~
The curtains are all closed in the buildings of this quiet street, the
residents of this district being notoriously secretive.  The sound of cats
screeching and fighting comes from a nearby alley, and only adds to the
creepiness.  A dark stone building with the attractive name `a'The Leech and
Root Apothecary'`l sits nestled between two taller building to the west. 
Seaham meets Raven Square to the north, and stretches towards the center of
town to the south.

Raven Square~
`aThis square is paved in polished black slate, so dark it absorbs the
light from the air itself.  It is otherwise plain, none of the elaborate
fountains or statues of the other squares.  A building stands imposingly to
the west, solid and without seams as if carved from a single piece of stone.
Two hunched and twisted gargoyles loom over the narrow iron door.  A warm
light shines from the inside of a small, less chilling, structure to the
north, `d'The Crow's Wing Inn'`a``.  `e`aSeahan Way leads off to the south, and
Pine street to the east.

Pine Street~
This quiet side-street provides a substantially less dreary atmosphere
than the dark stones of Raven Square to the west.  A narrow bed of pale
flowers lies on each side of the street, carefully trimmed and watered.  Few
of the locals walk about here, however, and most head east towards the
Cathedral.

along the top of a building to the south, reading `d'Goldmund's Antiques'`l.
A tall, narrow building to the north has a plain wooden sign which reads,
`d'Narcissus' Book Shop'`l.

stones.  The white stones are arranged into three curving lines radiating
from the center, creating a huge triskelion, holy symbol of the Church.  The
grand metal doors to the cathedral itself lie just to the east.  The
building is imposing, dark stone surrounding richly colored stained glass,
depicting the martyrs of the church dying by fire, water and steel.

amongst them.

the air, combining with other earthy scents and a faint trace of flowers.  A
sign, drawn in an unsteady hand, which reads `c'Fresh Produce'`l, hangs
outside a rickety wooden stand to the north.  Cumberland Avenue leads off to

Most of the homes along this brick road are owned by farmers who earned
enough and preferred living within the city walls to their ancestral homes. 
The residents move about dressed in garish copies of the clothes of the
nobility.  You guess there must be an interesting story about a sign to the
west, which reads: `d'The Dreadful Buzzard Tavern'`l.  Underneath hangs a
carving of a vulture holding a long golden chain in its mouth.  East from
here, you can see a large wooden sign proclaiming `c"Thesden Animal

The slate stones clatter with footsteps, hooves and wagon wheels.  The
street looks worn by the years, and though nothing is obviously broken, the
faded paint and cracked stones tell the story of many harsh winters.  The
street continues to the east, and opens into the hurried mobs of Devon
Square to the west.  A wooden sign with the picture of a tankard on it hangs
over the northern doorway.

who train and practice in the impressive stone structure to the east.  A few
rust-red stains on the grey marble of the square attest to the frequent
fights among the young nobles, and their often unhappy ends.  A clear sign
which reads `d'The Whetstone Inn'`l hangs outside a large wooden house to
the south.  Welford Road leads to the north, and Langhan Street to the west
of the square.

may study here.  Langhan Way opens into the magnificent Dorset Square to the
west, where its path of marble shimmers in the light.  Langhan Way continues

Thesdian nobles can be found, gossiping about the latest imports of silken
frocks or the travesty of the drop in the price of Firensian spices.  Seahan
Way leads off from here to the north towards Devon Square.  The faint sound
of music can be heard floating this way from the east, down Langhan Street.

Lavishly dressed nobles stare down their noses at you as you walk across

whereas their velvet slippered feet glide soundless across the surface.  The
decadence of their lavish lifestyle is evident in the luxurious fabrics of
their vestiments and the bold colors of their dress.  Through an iron gate
to the west, you can see the greens of Ashton Gardens, beautifully
landscaped and dominated by an ancient, massive oak tree.
