# Oldclans~
Exodus, having been around for quite some time now, has a rich history of clans
founded by players.  Some of them are still around today, but many of them have
faded off into the darkness of time.  Many of these you probably have not even
heard of, but I have done my best to assemble a list of their old helpfiles for
you to enjoy and for the older players to reminisce.  Just type help <clan> to
see these old files.

# DarkWarriors~
The Dark Warriors also known as the Knights of Takhisis are an elite
group.  They have given there life for the cause of EVIL.  Unlike many Evil
clan, this group is disciplined.  There's a reason for that: they have seen
what would happenened if they didn't change.
 
Evil has the nasty habit of turning on itself since most evil is 
personnalize by greed and self-power.
 
All classes are accepted, but they have to be Demonic or Satanic,
only mages may be Mean since Magic has a way of it's own.  And there are no
races restrictions.  But all must be for the progression of Evil.  
 
The Knighthood is based on the Code, and it's divided in three
basic precepts:
 
For the Warriors, Rangers, Paladins and Thieves: Independence breeds chaos.
Submit and be strong.
 
For the Clerics: Death is patient. It flows both from without and from within
Be vigilant in all and skeptical of all.
 
For the Mages: One who follows the heart finds it will bleed. Feel nothing
but victory.
 
 
And Finally All Must be Loyal To Each Others.

Clan Twilight is a group of wanderers that look upon the stars as
guidance.  What they see in the stars determine what their actions are.  If
the Twilight Clan see in the stars that all tho se actions.  On the other
hand, if the stars show doom for all criminals, the Twilight Clan will feel
implied to carry out these orders.  The Twilight Clan is compiled of mainly
of Mages, Rangers, Clerics, Paladins, and Bards, of different align,
although it has been rumored that a thief is lurking about.

# Liberta1~
Clan Libertad is a clan devoted to freedom and equality for all.  Any system
by which one person has power over another is shunned by members of this clan.
Any race or class may join this clan, but members of power-seeking institutions
may not feel very welcome.  Clerics and Paladins will be scrutinized carefully
as the church has traditionally been an power-wielding institution.
Slavery is perhaps the worst enemy of freedom, so Vro'ath who wish to join must
prove their lack of past involvement in the slave trade.  
Decisions in this clan will be made democratically by its members.  The clan
leader will have no duties other than beaurocratic ones.  At any time, if the
members decide on a new leader, the leader must step down.  
Activities of this clan shall, for the present, probably involve helping
newcomers to Exodus in their pursuits to become more skilled and less-likely
to be abused by elitism.  Later, the clan may decide to begin fighting for
its more lofty ideals, but this will be up to the members.

# Mercenary1~
But all was not well in the clan `iCrimsonPirates`h.  Word of their many triumphs
had caused their ranks to swell to over thirty members.  This made them a very
powerful clan, but it also caused them to lose their direction, and many of
the members cared little for the ways of the pirate and simply wanted the
security of a large family.  Many others had been some of the original
adventurers in the world of Exodus and had since then moved on to pursue other
interests.  `gSurma`h had also grown weary of leading such a diverse group and
passed leadership of the `iCrimsonPirates`h on to `bPossum`h, who took up the reigns
and tried to give the clan direction.
.
This proved to be a fruitless task and sadly it became obvious that the clan
simply could not go on in the fashion it was.
.
It was at this time that `bPossum`h thought out his options.  He still posessed
the spirit of adventure and felt the call of profit in his veins and he knew
that others felt the same way.  And he knew that others who were not in his
clan still relied upon the friendship of a group of strong individuals to help
them along the way to success not only where power was needed, but also where
advice was required.
.
`bPossum`h knew there was no way he could do this without hurting the innocent,
and he knew that many would want to join any new clan he created, so he
decided to make a policy carved in stone that could not be changed--ever.
.
And this is when he gathered together `eOrcus`h, `cLancelight`h, and `fGoldrym`h to make
the `aMercenary`h clan.
.
The `aMercenary`h clan gratefully acknowledges the successes of the people who
made possible for the first time many of the things that are common now.  Some
of the successes and people are (but by no means limited to):
.
`gSurma`h   - Founder of the `iCrimsonPirate`hs, the parent clan of `aMercenary`h clan.
             and creater of the first clan hall in Exodus
`6Blackbeard`h - First Mortal to circumnavigate Exodus by ship and finder of many
             areas and cities in the land.  Also Exodus's first Barrister.
`bPossum`h     - First Captain of a vessel in Exodus's waters, finder of Teche,
             Ebon Downs, and the first mortal to reach level 50.
`eOrcus`h      - Exodus's first Hero.  Only mortal to challenge EVERYONE...and win
.
Thanks also to all the people who were members of the `iCrimsonPirates`h and my
apologies to all the important people who I have forgotten to mention due to
my extended absense from the realms...

The Imperial Order is composed of the forerunners of the Cloud Giant Empire,
whose seat of power lies in the City of Weincloudstan.  They are a mismatched
bunch of people, chosen by the Empress for their knowledge of the low lands.
They have come to the low lands in order to subvert its people to the cause
of the Empress.  When the land becomes divided enough the Giants will descend
from the sky and attempt to conquer the land and all its people.  Those who
are looking for greater freedom and prosperity, align yourself with the 
Empress and they will be yours.  Those who seek to win the Empress's favor by
seeing that her work is done, join the Order and you will have a place of power
in the days to come.  Those who aid the Empire will advance in the ranks of its
Order, but those who stand against the will of the Empress will be killed 
without mercy.  Do not stand by while others gain the favor of the future
Empress of the known world, join the Imperial Order and take your place in 
history.
`iPlease Note:
In order to join this clan, you must meet four requirements.
1) Level Requirement     - No players under level 15 allowed.
2) Racial Requirement    - No Vro'ath, Sidhe, Syvin, or Elves allowed.
3) Guild Requirement     - No Clerics or Paladins allowed
4) Alignment Requirenemt - No Good-aligned people allowed (> 100 align)

`kIf you fail to meet any one of these requirements, then you are not the kind
of member our clan is looking for.  If you meet all of it, then apply and
send possum a tell or a note and you just might be added to the ranks of the
leaders.

holy `bNe'Shajh`e.  The great `bNe'Shajh`e himself flitted through these 
dreams, telling the Vro'ath where they had gone wrong... what they should do 
to fix this.  He showed them how they had been blinded by money and personal
power.  They no longer worked for the greater good of the Vro'ath people! 
these dreams came most strongly to one Vro'ath, the Vro'ath know as Arith.
`bNe'Shajh`e made Arith remember that day, the day that Arith's family had
been burned alive by an unforseen attack by elves.  He made Arith remember
the searing pain as Arith was consumed in fire.  He made Arith remember 
that Arith lived only because of a boon granted by him.  `bNe'Shajh`e told Arith 
that his life had not been spared so that he could become a slaver.  Arith was
to work for the greater good of the Vro'ath people!  Because of these dreams,
Arith made a pilgramage to Nre'yth, home of the Vro'ath. 
  
When Arith arrived at the ancient city he was appaled at the corruption that
was at the very heart of the city.  Even the temple itself used people as 
pawns, seemingly trying to increase thier personal power.  This disgusted
`eArith, for now the Vro'ath peopled seemed my like humans than they did 
honorable Vro'ath warriors!  Even the great temple itself, the object of 
Arith's journey, was not as it should be.  Even there one could find 
slaves.... corruption.... dishonor.  Arith then knelt down at the altar and
the fire within him burst out, consuming his mortal form.  Then Arith
emerged from the fire, recreated.  Gone were the scars of clan Varruk, 
replaced by the glowing symbol of `bNe'Shajh`e.  The first of the 
`aHoly Knights`e of `bNe'Shajh`e had been born.... born of fire and pain.  The
Vro'ath people had to be shown the corruption.  They would once again be
powerful and proud.. no longer merchants and slavers but warriors doing the 
bidding of `bNe'Shajh`e.  They would be clan Teluk, named for one of the two 
mountains that surrounded them.  A new begining has started.
   
`b------------------------------------------------------------------``
`hRules for Joining:``
  
`b1)`` EVIL. Your alignment must be evil.  We do have honor, but we are not good.
  
`b2)`` Race: Vro'ath and Dwarves only.
  
`b3)`` Level: You may apply at any level, but you need to be at least level 15 
before being accepted.
  
`b4)`` Classes: Warriors and Clerics mainly.  Anything else is a case by case thing.
  
`b5)`` RP: We are an honorable clan.  This means if we give our word on something,
we keep our word.  We do not and never will own slaves.  We also are not as 
prone to eating other sentient creatures as our more primative brethren. (our 
RP background is something you will learn more of upon being accepted into
the clan).
  
`b6)`` Also, as a final note, you must be willing to devote your life to serving
the great `bNe'Shajh`e.

# Minstrel~
Thank you for taking time to learn a little bit more about Clan Minstrel
and our goals we have for the near future.  Minstrel is a clan of all bards,
and no one of other professions, regrettably, may join.  We wish to spread
music and song throughout the realms, to everyone we meet.  Miscreants and
thugs may join, but if they do not remedy their ways to that of a travelling
minstrel, they will be asked to leave.  All races are welcome, except Sidhe,
who have a haven to play their music in another atmosphere.  Minstrel does
not wish to enrage any clan or any particular person, for most practical
purposes, we shall be neutral.  
~

# WeLoveSidhe~
In ancient times, the Sidhe were loved by all races.
Their carnival, the Carnivale du Sidhe was the envy of Vro'ath and
Canthi alike!  Sidhe were involved in all aspects of things
considered 'good'.  The CareBears(tm), TickleMeElmo's(tm), and
other fuzzy races treasured the Sidhe as an integral part of society.
Then came the cataclysm.
The convergence of energy reached planck scale, a vacume bubble
was created - the effect of this phenomena on the inhabitants
of the world was profound.  Before the vacume bubble could implode
the energies dissipated, leave their mark on the world in the
form of a planet wide metaphysical and epistemological shift.
Those who had loved before, now hated, those who quested for
knowledge now sought destruction.  And like all others, the Sidhe
too fell from greatness...
Clan WeLoveSidhe is dedicated to ressurecting the love for
these special creatures and spreading it throughout the realm.
It is hoped that once this worldview reaches critical mass it
will only be a matter of time before the world can return
to the way it once was.
~

# Anarchy1~
Anarchy as a political concept is a naieve floating abstraction...a society
without an organized government would be at the mercy of the first criminal
who came along and who would precipitate it into the chaos of gang warfare.
If a society provided no organized protection against force, it
would compel every citizen to go about armed, to turn her home
into a fortress, to shoot any strangers approaching her door-or 
to join a protective gang of citizens, who would fight other gangs, formed
for the same purpose, and thus bring about the degeneration of that
society into the chaos of gang-rule, i.e., rule by brute force
into perpetual tribal warfare of prehistorical savages.

# Anarchy3~
Anarchy, as a political concept, is a naive floating
abstraction...a society without an organized government
would be at the mercy of the first criminal who came along
and who would precipitate it into the chaos of gang warfare.
If a society provided no organized protection against force, it

gang-rule, i.e., rule by brute force, into perpetual tribal
warfare of prehistorical savages.
The Jhereg do not portend a revolution, as its press agents claim,
but a Putsch.  A Revolution is the climax of a long philosophical
development and expresses a nation's profound discontent.
A Putsch is a minority's seizure of power.  The goal of a
revolution is to overthrow Tyranny.
The goal of a Putsch is to establish it.
They had said that they saw no difference between economic
and political power, between the power of money and the power of
swords-no difference between reward and punishment, 
no difference between purchase and plunder, no difference
between life and death.
They will learn the difference now.
Enter Clan Jhereg...

# LegioDraconis~
`aWithin our lifetimes, many things will occur, we will learn, we will live, and

`cLegio`jDraconis `awas created so that we all may learn to survive.  Bad things may
happen to us all, yet this one thing binds us to one another.
The Legion of the Dragon provides protection for the weak, enlightenment for
willing, and friendship for the lonely.
We believe that enlightenment can only be gained by learning from youself
and those around you.
We wish to teach others that they may gain wisdom from our experiences, thus
avoiding the same mistakes and heartbreak we have faced and seek to overcome.
Any race that chooses to accept and follow the laws of The Legion of the
Dragon may join us:
1. Protect your friend, fellow clan members and those whom are weaker than
yourself, from the evil of the world.
2. Walk on the path of light and enlightenment.  The path of darkness teaches
only dark things resulting in acts which are tainted whith shadow.
3. Act with honor toward those around you.  We do not steal or loot corpses,
backstab, or otherwise attack another player without just cause.
`iOOC: All chars must be at least level 8 to be accepted.  This is a
roleplaying clan so all members need to have a description and a plan

# United~
For years, we, the individual members of clan United, have been taught by
our elders to hate and despise other races.  However, we have witnessed a
Great Hypocrisy in our elders' actions.  While we were being taught to hate
non-sidhe, we watched as our elders went off to help such people, clan with
them, and help them slay our fellow sidhe.  We wonder why our elders speak
of other races negatively, yet help them.  We wonder why they have slayed
fellow sidhe.  We wonder where we fit in, those of us who recognize this
hypocrisy between thought and action among our elders.  Why should we be
treated like non-sidhe, and non-sidhe be treated like friends to our
teachers.  Surely our elders have corrupted our souls with their teachings. 
Surely there is a reason for their hypocritical actions.  Therefore, clan
United has joined together in a pursuit of reason.  We wish to discover the
knowledge that will allow us to understand this world of chaos.  We offer no
haven from which further chaos may arise.  We offer an attempt at order and
truth.  Our only enemies are hypocrisy and those who dwell in it.  
~

# Pride2~
We are a group of people who share a few things in common:
.
We have all been hurt by others.  For some of us, by those who were once
close.  This is not a hurt of the flesh, but a pain of the heart; a thorn in
the soul.
.
We have been hurt because we were not understood, and were thus feared and
hated.  Because our ideas, or our nature were not agreeable--not the norm--
we have been judged negatively and unjustly.  We have all been ostracised
and cast out of the group or society we once loved and honoured.  That
fellowship might have been a family, a village, a clan, a country.
.
Our name is Pride, in strong reference to the fact that despite the scars
we bear in our hearts, our faces are inclined skyward, our jaws as firm
as our steely resolve.  We share a comradeship which binds us through
commonality, to raise sword and harp, wand and bow against those that 
choose to seek our unhappiness, or even our demise.
.
Our goal is to promote awareness, understanding, acceptance and harmony.
Only when the barriers of discrimination, prejudice and fear of the unknown
are abolished may we rest our orations, lay down our swords.
.
If you share in our pains and agree with our goals, then join us.  May we
have power in numbers, strength through spirit.
.
OOC: Anyone can join this clan, but they must have a strong RP background
which matches the spirit of the clan.  In other words, they must have been
cast out, or misunderstood by a group (such as their home town, or another
clan on this MUD).
.
If you feel you fit the bill, or feel strongly about the same ideas, and
wish to help us in our cause, apply to the clan, and send me a note to
let me know of your application.  I and my comrades will confer about your
eligibility.
.
Also, please have your plan filled out with your RP background, because 
that is extremely important in terms of your eligibility.

# Darkside4~
This clan exists for one sole purpose, that purpose is to end the Tyranny
that rules the realms.  The clan Darkside will use any means necessary to
finish the job without hurting any innocent people.  That is where their
name originated.  We are secretly located all around the realms brining end
to tyrant rule.  You could not and would not tell if a person next to you was
part of Darkside , for we have members from almost every race and almost
every class of power in the realms.  
`i*****
`iCLAN RULES:
1. You may be any align but we ask you to be good or neutral, or roleplay your
    situation well.
2. We look for mostly Mages, Warriors, Clerics, and Bards but we may accept any
    class but not likely.
3. You cannot be Vro'ath unless you strive for the clan purpose.  Also same with
    Sidhe which have a better chance than Vro'ath.
4. You may apply whenever, but we only accept 15 or above but we'd like you to be
    20 or above.
5. You must make a plan (description optional) that makes sense and shows your
    roleplay with the clan.
*****
`lP.S: Vro'ath and Sidhe will have a VERY hard time getting in the clan.  Everyone
in the clan that is an active player must agree to a Vro'ath or Sidhe joining unless
ordered otherwise.  This does not mean they aren't allowed.

# RamBrakka~
`i
Long ago, there was a mage known only as Brakiss, who managed to harness all the magical powers of the realm and turn himself into the living embodiment of evil.
Brakiss ruled the realm unchallenged until an unknown paladin and his "Goodly" followers trapped Brakiss inside a crystal which held his massive power.
However, before his imprisonment Brakiss started a secret order of skilled Humans, Dark Elves, Sidhe, and the rare Dark Canthi.
It was this secret order that succesfully stole away the crystal from the paladin so that they could attempt to free their master.
After years of trying to free their master, the secret order went underground awaiting the moment when the powers of evil would be at there peak so that Brakiss could rule once more.
It has been hundreds of years since the last time a member of this secret order has been seen.
However, throughout the world an old elven term has resurfaced to describe those of pure evil who disappear without a trace:  `oRamBrakka. 
Literally translated:  the Knights of Brakiss...
`i
`i
`i
Those interested in joining the ranks of the `oRamBrakka `imust:
1) Be EVIL
2) Must be Human, Dark Elf, Sidhe, or Dark Canthi.
3)Go through an ordeal used to initiate them into the order.
If you meet the first two and wish to join, apply as usual.  
You will then be contacted by the clan leader who will tell you your ordeal.

        `ko`oAny Class
  
        `a[`bWar`a]`h
  
        `ko`o Extremely likely to initiate a war

`b[`aRP History`b]`h
  
        `a[`bSidhe Background`a]`h
  
`oThe Sidhe are ancient race,, the eldest of the fey races.  Little is
known of their origins or their history.  The knowledge gleaned through
careful examination of old, rotting histories is almost worthless.  The
most common information comes from the reptition of children's stories
and bardic tales in remote areas of the world, such as the Teche Bayou
and the Desert of Ath'Tanar.  The common elements within these stories
stresses the isolationist nature of the Sidhe, and their mischievious
ways.`h
 
`bTimes however, have changed.`o
  
For reasons known only to the Sidhe, the creatures have been appearing
more and more in civilized areas.  Attempts at communication with the
race have, for the most part, failed.  Successful communication with
elder Sidhe have only revealed a vague sense of confusion and lack of
knowledge of  `bWHY`o the Sidhe have begun to re-emerge.  Reknowned 
historian Armedius Hirinjakk has noted one consistency through this
chaotic migration.  They are all progressing toward the south.
  
        `b[`aClan Jhereg`b]`o
  
The House of Jhereg formed as a response to displeasure with Clan
Divergent.  How any Sidhe could defile themselves to follow the
philosophy of a non-sidhe named Auvyron and become embroiled in the
conflicts of the lesser races is beyond our reasoning.  To go further
and pledge support for Auvyron is unspeakable.  Not only is their
philosophic stance untenable, their willingness to sacrifice themselves
for Ayvyron is indicative of extremely psychological instability.
  
Outwardly, House Jhereg seeks to control Thesden.  Chaos rules Thesden.
Ferath Athanmere has ruled for over twenty years, unopposed.  The Clans 
are engaged in open warfare.  The law is dead letter, and Thesden Guard
is unstable - acting one moment as mindless observer and the next as
vicious press gang.  We are displeased.  House Jhereg outwardly seeks
two goals - first, control crime in Thesden (thus solidfying their
position as an organized crime syndicate) and secondly, two over throw
Ferath Athanmere of Castle Dunluce and seat their in the position of
power.
   
Secretly, Jhereg pursues two further goals.  The first is the demise of
opposing clans.  Through conversion of non-sidhe to place their
loyalties with House Jhereg it is hoped that infiltration of other clans
might occur.  Combining this with setting the other clans against one
another it is hoped that these offensive tribal gangs might be
extinguished.  The second goal, is much more insidious.  It is known
that Auvyron fled to the south, beyond the dwarven ranges to work his
magics.  Through theft of documents from the Council of Nine, Jhereg has
learned that the rift may still be openable, that artifacts of Auvyron
may still exist, and that the secrets of his work might be unconverable.
It is possible that by establishing a wide information network, and
through carefully planned expeditions, Jhereg may discover Auvyron's
lost tower and infiltrate it.  Post-discovery may lead to power, wealth,
knowledge, and the means to eradicate the belief in Auvyron's philosophy
from those still pledging allegiance to clan divergent.

                     `gClan Teluk``
`eI sit here, glaring at the candle's flame that dances before my eyes.  I
ponder what has brought me to this point in my difficult, shattered
life.  My people have become corrupt, more and more like the humans and
elves that they enslave every day.  They do not understand that greed, that
the pursuit of material things, is not right.  Glory in battle, fighting for
`bNe'Shajh`e, that is true life.  That is the true path of the Vro'ath
people.  We are the choosen children of the great one, but we act like the
lesser creatures, ruled by animal greed.  That is why the slavery is wrong. 
By enslaving these creatures we keep them close to us, we hear thier words
and we are corrupted by it.  Perhaphs they are all to far gone, perhaphs we
have failed in serving `bNe'Shajh`e.  But I wish to belive we can still find
the true path!  I know that my people can, they just need a leader.  And
this leader must be willing to lead his people into a great war.....  A war
to reclaim what is ours!  We, the children of `bNe'Shajh`e, are the true
rulers of this world!  We must be willing to fight, to kill those who oppose
us like the diseased vermin that they are! 
   
`eThe corruption goes to deep, even the church is starting to belive as those 
who lust for money rather then blood.  Lust for material goods rather than 
`eglory and honor in combat! Even the dwarves who have served well are
starting to stray from the true path.  But I, and all Vro'ath who feel
`bNe'Shajh's`e hunger for blood and sacrifice, will lead others to the great 
cause.  I can feel this deep down, and there will be a baptism, a baptism
by fire.  The fires or war and anger shall flood over the world, the streets
will run with blood, and in the end only the true Vro'ath shall stand.  I can 
see this now.....  And I await the great battle to come.

`hRules for Joining:
   
`b1)`` EVIL. Your alignment must be evil.  We do have honor, but we are not good.
`b2)`` Race: Vro'ath and Dwarves only. Dwarves will never attain full status
because of past betrayals.
`b3)`` Level: You may apply at any level, but you need to be at least level 15
before being accepted.
`b4)`` RP: Our true purpose is the total domination of the world. We are the only
true race, and we shall rule as it is meant to be. We do not eat the weaker 
races because they are disease ridden, corrupting. They are worthy of nothing
but death. Also, we fight with honor and for the glory of `bNe'Shajh``.

# Libertadx~
Clan Libertad is a clan devoted to freedom and equality for all.
Any system by which one person has power over another is shunned
by members of this clan.  In a perfect world, any race would be
welcome to join our clan, but as it is, we will not accept
Vro'ath or Sidhe in our clan to protect it from being twisted to
their evil desires.  Clerics and Paladins will be scrutinized to
make sure they are not part of the power-grabbing establishment
of the church.  Clerics and Paladins interested in Liberation
Theology are welcome.
Decisions in this clan will be made democratically by its
members.  The clan leader will have no special duties or
priveledges other than those of a beaurocratic nature.  If at any
time the members of clan Libertad wish to have a new leader
(elected democratically, of course) the old leader must step down.
At first our activities will likely center on helping newcomers
to Exodus become more skilled in order to reduce the power that
others can have over them.  When our members grow strong, we will
begin to fight more for our ideals and stand up to gross abuses
of power, elitism, etc.
Since slavery is such a terrible problem in Exodus, we will strive
to fight it both directly and in more subtle ways.  For this reason
we are the sworn enemies of the Varruk clan.
.
OOC NOTES:
Clerics and Paladins should have something meaningful about their
relationship to the church in Exodus in their plans to contribute
to role-playing.  Vro'ath and Sidhe are not allowed because they
supposed to be evil.  Most members should be good, but neutral
alignments will be tolerated as "freedom-fighters" often use
methods that are not very nice.  We'll try to stay away from PK
for a while, unless we are provoked.  Loners and clanned people
who attack our members should not be surprised if the favor is 
returned, even if out of level.  In general, no member of Libertad
should ever PK without just provocation (i.e. in a clan war or to
a PK of one of our members).
This clan will try to concentrate on role-playing.  If you don't
care about role-playing, and just want to kill people, please
don't apply.  If you are interested and want to try to roleplay
being a freedom fighter, please apply!
If you have any questions, feel free to contact Mirinara. :)

# Shaldow~
`oDuring the time the land was Reforming and the elders were coming together,  there was a time when the forest of the land were new and green.  Animals flurished, plants were plentiful.
`oBut through the years to come beautiful and majestic the land was it was shortly turned into un-pure and un-clean land.
`oOne day a being came to this abandon ruin of a forest, he stood before unmoving and undaring.
`oA few hours past and he finaly moved toward the ruins,  When getting there he pulled some seeds out of his pocket and knelt down on the destroyed land.
`oHe dug a little whole and droped the seeds in.  He stood up stareing at the whole and seeds then turned around and vanished.  This person was never seen again.  A few years later the seeds begin to grow.
`oNot just plants but a human as well. This human in the legends is suppose to be the care taker of the forest in the scroll his name is "R-a-y-m-o-n".

# LiLan~
During the time the land was Reforming and the elders were coming
together, there was a time when the forest of the land were new and green. 
Animals flurished, plants were plentiful.  But through the years to come
beautiful and majestic the land was it was shortly turned into un-pure and
un-clean land.  One day a being came to this abandon ruin of a forest, he
stood before unmoving and undaring.  A few hours past and he finaly moved
toward the ruins, When getting there he pulled some seeds out of his pocket
and kneels down on the destroyed land.  He dug a little whole and droped the
seeds in.  He stood up staring at the whole and seeds then turned around and
vanished.  This person was never seen again.  A few years later the seeds
begin to grow.  Not just plants but a human as well.  This human in the
legends is suppose to be the care taker of the forest in the scroll his name
is "R-a-y-m-o-n".  The beginning scroll end heres but a sentence closes it
off.  It states, "O' think you thee god of life, for thee have brought back
thee joy and beauty of land itself!  , Thank you my god which we shall call,
"Li'Lan".  And so the scroll ends and it remebered only by the new care
takers of the forest of Li'Lan.

# Purge~

`eClan `bPurge`e is all about `bPurging`e the evil clans of the world, like stinky `aVro'ath`e and egotistic `aSidhe`e.
Everyone must help the lower, less fortunate people of thier class in this clan.  Because it all comes around somehow.  
We have to band together to rid the Realm of all moral filth.  The purpose of this clan isn't killing, defending.
If one of our young brothers falls victim to the weak wrath of a baneful Sidhe, you can be sure we will be right at thier side and revenge thier untimely deaths.
                        `e-`b+`e>`qP`e<`b+`e-
`bClan Requirements:
`e1)`b You `eCANNOT`b be Vro'ath, Sidhe, or Evil.
`e2)`b You must make an good background on how you came upon the clan.
`e3)`b You must be at least level `e15`b.
`e4)`b You have to respect the leaders' `edecisions`b and `eactions`b, if you object than you can state your objection.

# Brain~
Left and right, old and new, wisdom and folly, life and death all come
together in the Brain.  It thrives on contradiction, grows and spreads
through a myriad of counter-actions, too complex for any one being to
understand.  Some say the Brain is still dormant.  Others think it dead. 
Most are unaware of its history.  Misconceptions, now too abundant to be
believed, will slowly fade away in the impossible light and impenetrable
darkness the Brain will bring.  Join it if you can.  Run if you can't.

# Irrelevant~
Why are you reading this helpfile?  It's irrelevant.  But then what
isn't, in these times.  Irrelevant is as irrelevant does.  Joining the clan,
while smart, is itself an irrelevant and pointles act.  So why do it?  Or
why not?  The clan's complete irrelevance is precisely what makes it the
only potentially relevant clan in the world.  We are now seeking new,
active, interesting, fearless people who are not self-absorbed to join us in
the dirty, low-paying, generally-unacknowledged, but stimulating work of
irrelevancy.  Preference will be given to Sidhe--for their natural
brilliance, mischievous ways and innate sense of comic timing--but other
races will be considered too.  
No humorless holy folk, no pedants, no bores, no humans may be admitted to the clan

suitable description to match this role, and commit to playing it.  You must
also pass a rigorous entrance exam.  We are especially looking for young,
idealistic, aggressive adventurous types.  Join now, and be irrelevant.  Or
continue to fool yourself about your own worth, if that suits you better.

and purge the`i e`bv`ii`bl`n still roaming the ruined lands.
  Today the Azurians are at constant battle witht he followers of the evil god Ne'Shajh, and stay pure
by worshipping their god Xalf.  They still help the younger, less wise people of the realm and convert
the denizens of the realms.  Only when the balance between good and evil is restored shall the Azurian
Purgers lay down their weapons and retire to their humble homes.

Intially, the paladins and knights of the Argent stronghold was the first
line of Thesden's defense and Brotherhood was used in reserved.  However,
with the recent temporary defeat and occupation of Thesden by the Dark
God, King Athanmere has decided he must take every necessary precaution to
insure an event like this never occurs again.  With this plan in mind, King
Athanmere met with the lords of Brotherhood to discuss strategies to protect
Thesden.  With the aid of King Athanmere and his advisors, Brotherhood accepted
their suggestion to allow wizards into the clan.  "The bottom line is that
Brotherhood wants to continue to help protect Thesden from all threats,
and we must accomodate with change."  Said Kryian Silverstar during a recent
town meeting.  Kryian also added, "Wizard have always been and important
role in defending great kingdoms, and if Brotherhood expects to keep defending
this great kingdom, then we will need the wisdom and mystical power a
wizard possess."

`aIn the begining, the Immortals created this realm known as Exodus. They created the towns and the
forests and the oceans, and eventually the inhabitants. This included the monsters, the animals,
and most importantly, the people. People were thier most prized possession. The Immortals watched
them mature as warriors, and as intellectuals. They witnessed the creation of clans. Clans were the
peoples way of showing who they were, and what they believed in. This was a good thing. And then
everything went wrong. The people developed a hatred for the Immortals and so the Immortals began
to punish and kill the ones they felt causes the biggest problems. Others took their own lives due
to the unfairness the felt they were given by the Immortals. Then one fateful day, sadly, Exodus
was destroyed. The Immortals needed time to figure out where they went wrong, and how they could
fix it. The ideas passed as fast as the time, until finally, they came to a decision, and Exodus
was restored to all its glory.
      
We are now in a new age. Much like the old, yet different. The clans are stronger than ever, as is
the relationship between Immortals and people. Goodness flourishes, and hatred and evil are shunned.
But there is a force working diligently to corrupt the happy feelings of the people, not by turning
them against their Immortals, but by turning them against eachother. This force is not seen, or
heard, only felt. This force, released durring the unturning of the world, is called Synn.

Clan Synn's goal. As it has not yet been found, Clan Synn must search the world, trying to turn
everyone they meet to evil, in hopes that they will find the one who is worthy to wear the crown.
      
The first to feel the power of the crown was Psylent. He tried to wear the crown, but was zapped
by its extreme evil, and left for dead. He awoke in a chamber of corpses and blood and filth, weary

# Libertad~
`a"`kIndependence. Freedom.  They are weeds that grow in your gardens.`a"``
Simon hollered to the crowd below him.  `a"`kYou can cut them out, try to tear them 
by the roots but more will come, and will come untill those gardens, filled before
with what was `o'`hproper and right`o'`k are now choked with every kind of being,
each one screaming in defiance against those that dare act against natural order.
And it is the true natural order.  ``Simon paused to glance at four guards: veterans
by their appearance.  They were listening and not liking what they heard.  Simon did
not stop though. `a"`kThe seeds have planted themselves upon this land long ago
and the first weeds have sprouted.  The outcome is inevitable.  Those that call for
the `o'`hprefect order`o'`k have shown themselves and shall fight for their right to
oppression and control over the masses.  Their tools are intimidation, cruelty,
slavery, and elimination.`a"``Simon glared at the men in armor.  It was silent now
around the flowing fountain the people watched the scene, waiting for the battle to
begin.  Watched, and listened.  `a"`kThey use them because they know.  They know
of the natural order of the world, the rights of man and woman, the natural freedom
of life, thought, choice and speech given to all who ask for it.  Who demand for
it.`a"
`a
"`kDo you feel the lack of control?`a"`` Simon called out with difficulty.  The guards
have moved to quiet this dangerous speech, but Simon fought them off.  `a"`Do they
have the right to make the choice of how you act, how you breath, and how you die?
People of Thesdon.  DO THEY HAVE THE RIGHT!?`a"
`a
"`wNO!`a"`` they cried, not  Simon, but the listeners.   The call is soon replaced with
clashing steel as the crowd turns on the guards, driving them back.  Roars are now
heard from the front lines.  The blood curtling  sounds of Kai fills the air. The guard
line is shattered as lightning bolts fall from the clear sky. The retreating men trip and
fall as vines shoot from the paved floor to trap them. The battle cries come together
in a sorrowful melody.  The fallen resistance cry for pity and forgiveness.
`a
"`kMay the gardens of Thesdon, and the world choke in the change.  May the
guardeners feel the blades of Liberty.`a"``  He said, and the people cheered in reply.

OOC
`a
`aClan `iLibertad`a is the heart and sword of the `bClash of Fate`a, a revolution started 
long ago by `eSimon Demontfort`a which strives to protect and defend the `bNatural
Rights`a of all who acknoledge them.  While any and all may join the `bCoF`a,
`iLibertad`a is more selective, for it's members would give their lives willingly with no
regrets or complaints if the cause is benifited by it.  `iLibertad's`a 'leader' is, in fact,
just the representative, and organizer, in charge of rallying the clan and making sure
the decisions made are carried out.  The decisions, however are made by a voting
system which gives no preference to any members.
`a
We start looking for new members at Level 20, Vro'aths and sidhes are denied and all
clerics and paladins must PROVE themselves before they will even be consitered.
Evil would not want anything to do with freedom.
`a
 Above all, `iLibertad`a is and will always be requiring roleplay and a 'take it easy'
additude.  Our members have accepted the chance of being pked, sometimes without
cause and will simply recover what they can and move on.   This does not mean that
revenge will not be taken- in fact expect any and all members hunting down one that
has assalted them- but it means a Libertad will not be spamming the global channels
saying "You stupid #@*(#@ you killed me!!".  Resorting to their level of pking
without a reason is not an option here.  If it is not out of revenge or in a war then pk
will be used when other methods to stop the violation of someone's Rights have
failed (if they have given up the oppression/pk-attempt then there is no reason to
chase them further).``

`oClan Admin has been formed as a temporary solution for the Immortal Exodus Admins
(Clan, Quest, Law, Code, Head Admin) to be able to converse on a semi-private basis 
about the management of Exodus in general regarding the above mentioned positions and
about how the Immstaff in general is working in regards to those areas.
    
As this is not a true clan, Race, Alignment and Class is not an issue for joining.
The only requirement is that members of the clan must be level 97 or higher.
 
The clan has been set up for communicative purposes ONLY and will be disbanded when
a more permanent solution can be set up (such as a Senior Immortal channel being 
implemented).

# merchants~
Splinters flew as, for the second time, a mast breaks in half on the giant vessel.  The crew is scattering 
about, trying to lower the remaining sails as the hard rain slickens the old decks.  But all for nothing... 
Marooned on the eastern shores of the Sea of Fate is where she now stands, a wreck, once known as the N 
& T.
   Now, several years later, Captain Tigger has brought the few surviving crew to live with him and 
accompany him on his daily search for wanted items.  Some may call them booty hunters. But most... Most call them, "Merchants".
  The nomad Merchants now move from city to city, offering thier wares and even hunting down items for a 
bounty.  Thier Captain, Tigger, sends them on quests often times weekly, to search for items, and when 
brought back, they obtain a gift, or prize. The inhabitants of the former N & T have learned to enjoy this 
game and the receive a small rock for every item they bring back... later, they return these rocks for a larger 
item. And so on and so forth.
`g]|`l\/`g|[``
NON ROLEPLAY:  Basically we are hunters of treasure, we seek, we find, we sell or hoard.  There will be in-
clan prizes and rewards for best booty.  I'm offering a large clan hall (40+ rooms) and of course, clan 
equipment. The requirements are as follows: Bard, Mage, Warrior, Good, Canthi, Human, Dwarf.  If you fall 
under one of these catagories, please note Tigger, or talk to one of the deputies.  This is a friendly clan, real 
family like in orientation.  Plan and description would be nice to have.  And the plan doesn't neccessarily 
have to be based upon joining the clan, just have the fateful crash and if you weren't in the crash, how you 
stumbled upon the crew.

Brotherhood's role has always been to protect the rights of the innocent and

living by the following values:  loyalty, respect, honor, integrity, and
bravery.  Brotherhood will in no way seek out to destroy evil.  Brotherhood
acknowledges "evil's" right to exist and will only use force if the peace
we are trying to keep is threatened.

Intially, the paladins and knights of the Argent stronghold was the first
line of Thesden's defense and Brotherhood was used in reserved.  However,
with the recent temporary defeat and occupation of Thesden by the Dark
God, King Athanmere has decided he must take every necessary precaution to
insure an event like this never occurs again.  With this plan in mind, King
Athanmere met with the lords of Brotherhood to discuss strategies to protect
Thesden.  With the aid of King Athanmere and his advisors, Brotherhood accepted
their suggestion to allow wizards into the clan.  "The bottom line is that
Brotherhood wants to continue to help protect Thesden from all threats,
and we must accomodate with change."  Said Kryian Silverstar during a recent
town meeting.  Kryian also added, "Wizard have always been and important
role in defending great kingdoms, and if Brotherhood expects to keep defending
this great kingdom, then we will need the wisdom and mystical power a
wizard possess."

role in defending great kingdoms, and if Brotherhood expects to keep
defending this great kingdom, then we will need the wisdom and mystical
power a wizard possess."  However as the needs of the clan continued on it
was decided that the protection of the City of Thesden needed to be extended
out beyond the walls.  At this time the leadership of the clan decided that
it would be wise to start accepting the warriors of the Forest, Rangers, to
our ranks.  This has effectively increased our ability to protect both
inside and outside the City of Thesden.

# Backwards~
You have undoubtedly heard the rumors.  Old men beating up nobles all
over Thesden.  Small groups of decrepit geezers harrassing would-be
adventurers in the surrounding lands.  Orphans, drunks and destitute widows
receiving gifts of unimaginable splendor from nameless, rasping folk who
disappear without a word into the night.  Backwards masses being led by
costumed old women in churches all across the realm.  Some have suggested
that a conspiracy of old war veterans, peeved at the antics of today's
youth, is fomenting revolution.  Others, more rational, believe it is all
part of a Sidhe plot, hatched by the mad bard Salman, in which he has
somehow charmed, corrupted or brainwashed the aging populace and led them
into a guerilla war against all that is holy.  The clergy claim it is the
work of pack of renegade demented demons, dedicated to the overthrow of the
church.  The few sane people who have been known to comment on the possibly
worsening situation prefer to believe it is the work of a few, unconnected
senile old men who have nothing better to do.  But who really knows?  And if
some secret society of decrepit grandparents does exist, is it really
anything to be concerned about?  Can a bunch of crazy old loons wreak havoc
in the land?  Hardly likely.

`l The Revolution is upon us.  It is time for the Sidhe people to revolt
against all that is good and pure in the realms of Exodus.  By following
Xjndor Brakaii, the true god of the Sidhe people, we shall once again rule
the realms, and all shall know our power.  We seek not a physical revolution
for their is no ruling class or clan to revolt against, but a mental revolution
in which everyone will come to fear the true power of the Sidhe.  Either the
people of Exodus will allow this mental revolution to take place or they will
perish, maybe even both.
`i******************************************************************************-

`bRequirements
 `e-Sidhe of any class
 -A passed entrance test
 -A desire and a commitment to further the Revolution
``
`bDivisions
  `e There are 3 main division of Revolution, the Ram Brakka, Nal Xjin, and the Xjo Kyn.
When you pass the entrance test you will be placed in the appropriate group, with the
ability to move between if you assert the qualifications desired for the higher group.
Upon acceptance each member will be asked to carry out certain tasks concerning the 
revolution.  The Ram Brakka is the lowest group, they are mainly the helpers of the 
other two groups.  They provide services for the other members and help keep the clan
in balance.  They usually stay out of battle, but nonetheless can kill the enemy when
needed.  The Nal Xjin is the second to highest group.  Their job is to kill, but they
are still learning and do not yet have the experience and sheer power to be in the
Xjo Kyn.  The Xjo Kyn is the highest group. They are the super-elite Sidhe.  Their
job is to drive sheer terror into the enemy, for few have ever survived a battle with
an Xjo Kyn, and even fewer have seen one dead.
``
`bTolerations
  `e The only other clans we can stand are Jhereg, for they are sidhe like us, and
Varruk, for their evilness allows us to ignore the fact they they are not Sidhe for
the time being.  No other clans are tolerated, every other clanned person is open for
death by Revolution.  A non-sidhe may slip into the ranks of Revolution provided they
forsake the rest of the realm, devote their life to Xjndor Brakaii, and are of the 
caliber needed to reside in the Xjo Kyn.

# MorningStar~
`t<(\/)>``                                      Clan MorningStar
   For years in which evil has plagued the realm of Exodus, the righteous
of the lands has done nothing but kill each other off.  This time has passed,
and a new order has formed!  Wanderers, merchants and mercanaries alike have
banded together to spread unity throughout the land of the good, and will some
day have a force so powerful that their wealth and power in Thesden will bring
the righteous the justice and safety from evil they deserve!  No longer will
good fight good, human fight human, or canthi fight canthi, for the coming of
the MorningStar is finally here, and all good must band to extinguish those
who cannot be taught what is right and wrong!
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Clan MorningStar is split into two branches within the clan...
- The first branch consists of powerful warriors, bards, mages and clerics, 
who strike down the foe with their mighty sword and scroll.  They serve, with
all this might, to serve justice in the lands, and help the needy with what
ever they may need to survive.
- The second branch consists of a merchant guild of bards and other Canthis,
who walk the streets, perform for the citizens of Thesden, and spread the 
legends of the old times, when people were safe to walk the streets, and the
city was a pleasant place to live.  These merchants also sell extremely rare 
goods to the most powerful of names across the lands, travelling far to buy 
and sell the most precious of items.
   Clerics also play a very important role in Clan MorningStar, as they are
responsible for spreading the word of unity, and preach it through the church,
so that those who are religious would be driven by their faith to join us, and
do what is right and help us spread the word, growing with us as we grow!
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The races/classes required to join Clan MorningStar are as follows:
- Races: Dwarf, Human and Canthi.
- Classes: Cleric, Warrior and Mage
The clan's alignment is Good. (A prospect with an alignment of less than 500
will not be admitted into the clan).
Levels when you may join Clan MorningStar are as follows:
- Warriors are required to be at least level 30 to join.
- Clerics and Mages are required to be atleast level 40 to join the clan.

`bTolerations
`e   In order to complete the revolution, we must tolerate some other inhabitants of
Exodus.  We are happy to help Jhereg, for they are sidhe like us with a similar goal,
and we also approve of Folk and Fools because they are evil and crazy enough to help
us in our goals (although they may not truly grasp the concept of our plans).  We 
tolerate Varruk, for their extreme evilness towards the other clans does not stand in
our way for right now, so we let them be.  No other clans are tolerated, every other
clanned person is open for death by Revolution.

Don't fit anywhere?  Looking for a home?  Join us, we'll give you a
purpose in Exodus, and a home to hang your gear.  We're currently looking
for people who do not aspire to PK.  Anyone who wish this can find it with
most other clans.  Also, experiance in this mud isnt nessessary either, just
dedication to the clan and a willingness to play Exodus.  One rule here will
be mandatory, and that is a set weekly meeting with all clan members, if
possible.  To discuss and even argue about any current subject going on
here.  We also should have a solid RP reason for the clan, i've come up with
a couple ideas, and think we should get more input also.  I'd like to center
our clan on corpse recovery , this would be a useful community service, and
a great RP role, as well.  Imagine going to the scene of Death and ritually
recovering said corpse, with full ceremony.  What the ceremony entails and
how we do it is open for discussion.

But cor;get coin Afterlife focuses on not death in itself, but preparing
the departed for a new life.  As such, the clan is not evil, as death is
natural and part of life you need no special skills or abilities or
experiance to join Afterlife, only willingness to help the world of Exodus
by teaching everyone to except death as part of life.  Afterlife holds
weekly meetings to discuss events and hold funerals.  Those that cannot make
a meeting must submit at least an oocn stating this.  Our main goal for
community service is Corpse Recovery.  This helps our fellow nopk clan as
well, letting Solitaire concentrate on giving info and help elsewhere.  I'd
like as much ceremony and RP as possible to go into these corpse recoveries,
this can be varied and as involved as you like.  I've gotten a few restrings
already , iron chests restrung as coffins, and hope to store every corpse we
recover as proof to our usefulness as a clan and a guide to how much we are
needed and used for our service As we are very new here, i'd like as much
help financing our currently non-exsistant clan hall as possible.  As well
as recruiting and advice as to what races and classes should join us.  As it
stands, so far we have Angelic, syvin, elf, and human , and i'd like to
include neutral and canthi as well.  No evil will be allowed, as this isnt a
Death Cult, its a service to help Exodites Accept Death, and continue onward
in their spiritual journey.  
`k For now, until further input , this is what our rule of 7 looks like:
`` Angelic and Neutral, Syvin, Elf, Human, Canthi, Dwarf.

# Forsakened~
===========================================================================
Clan Forsakened/ Pkillers
-
-
The members of this clan was once "forsakened" as young by their friends
and families. Their beliefs differred from the society they were living
in. Banished from their homes, with nothing but despair they hid in the 
sewers. After meeting others like them, they began to depend on eachother 
for their survival. Combining their knowledge and great strength they 
began to develop a new form of combat. Time passed and they gathered the
courage to reveal their existence to the world. With nearly non-existant 
knowledge about the world above ground they were laughed at, but it came
to an end when they declared war on Thesden and anyone that dared to
oppose them. The war ended very quickly, Thesden had fallen and the clans 
with it. The new rulers of Thesden called themselves the Forsakened. 
After the great victory they vanished from the face of the earth never to 
be seen again and only to be spoken of in legends.
-
Now they have returned to the realms of Exodus once again...
-
===========================================================================
-
(OOC)
To Join the Clan:
-
You HAVE to be an expirienced character.
You HAVE to be level 80 or higher.
You HAVE to know how to pkill well.
Your clan MUST come first.
Your honor is the clans honor.
-
-
1) Race: Syvin/Human
2) Class: Thief/Warrior/Mage/Cleric/Bard
3) Align: Neutral/Evil
-
===========================================================================
-
The Clan of Forsakened are not just evil. But due to living all their lives in the
underground they do not know much about feelings.  But they understand the
difference between good and evil.

# Folk~
We are the Folk.  We have lived in this world longer than anyone can
remember.  Our ancestors once lived and prospered in the great forest,
nurturing its growth, long before the appearance of the short-lived races. 
These bickering, thoughtless peoples, bound by their own short-sightedness,
have done little but foul and destroy what was once the beautiful homeland
of our people.  Driven from our homes and lands, we have lost much: many of
our people have died, much of our culture has been forgotten, our history
buried.  Now a few of us, mostly younger elves and syvin, have ventured out
to visit and, if possible reclaim our heritage, our history and our
homeland.  We are a peace-loving people, but we are tired of grieving, tired
of running.  We are prepared to fight, if we must, to preserve our culture
and recover what has been stolen from us.
=%=%= =%=%=   CLAN REQUIREMENTS   =%=%=   =%=%=
________________________________________________ We are a group of young Elf
Canthi and Syvin Warrior Cleric, Mages, Thieves and Bards.  We are strictly evil,
living a law beyond the imagination of the lesser races, with their childish
beliefs and fears.  To join the clan, you must be strongly committed to our
cause, prepared to help elf and syvin alike at all times.  You must also
have a strong love of nature, a desire to protect the forest and its
wildlife as best you can.  We accept elves and syvin of all ages (levels)
and especially encourage spirited, inventive young (low level) adventurers
to join the Folk.

        `ko`o Sidhe Only
        `ko`o Any Class

        `ko`o Will probably continue subtle hostilities after war
  
`b[`aRP History`b]
  
        `a[`bSidhe Background`a]`h
  
`oThe Sidhe are ancient race,, the eldest of the fey races.  Little is
known of their origins or their history.  The knowledge gleaned through
careful examination of old, rotting histories is almost worthless.  The
most common information comes from the reptition of children's stories
and bardic tales in remote areas of the world, such as the Teche Bayou
and the Desert of Ath'Tanar.  The common elements within these stories
stresses the isolationist nature of the Sidhe, and their mischievious
ways.`h
  
`bTimes however, have changed.`o
  
For reasons known only to the Sidhe, the creatures have been appearing
more and more in civilized areas.  Attempts at communication with the
race have, for the most part, failed.  Successful communication with
elder Sidhe have only revealed a vague sense of confusion and lack of
knowledge of  `bWHY`o the Sidhe have begun to re-emerge.  Reknowned 
historian Armedius Hirinjakk has noted one consistency through this
chaotic migration.  They are all progressing toward the south.
  
        `a[`bClan Jhereg`a]`o
  
The House of Jhereg formed as a response to displeasure with Clan
Divergent.  How any Sidhe could defile themselves to follow the
philosophy of a non-sidhe named Auvyron and become embroiled in the
conflicts of the lesser races is beyond our reasoning.  To go further
and pledge support for Auvyron is unspeakable.  Not only is their
philsophic stance untenable, their willingness to sacrifice themselves
for Auvyron is indicative of extremely psychological instability.
  
Outwardly, House Jhereg seeks to control Thesden.  Chaos rules Thesden.
Ferath Athanmere has ruled for over twenty years, unopposed.  The Clans
are engaged in open warfare.  The law is dead letter, and Thesden Guard
is unstable - acting one moment as mindless observer and the next as
vicious press gang.  We are displeased.  House Jhereg outwardly seeks
two goals - first, control crime in Thesden (thus solidfying their
position as an organized crime syndicate) and secondly, to over throw
Ferath Athanmere of Castle Dunluce and seat their in the position of
power.
  
        `a[`bMisc.`a]`h
  
`oExcerpt from the Journal of Morian e'Drien - `aThe Grey Mouse`o
  
Day of `kThunder`o, 23rd the Month of winter
  
Chaos rules the land.  The Government of Ferath Athanmere in Thesden is
dead letter.  The motives of the priest class in the City of the Sun are
unfathomable.  Whenever I have a quiet moment I feel a strange beckoning
from the south.  I look there in my dreams and see only darkness.  I
hear the murmering of the wizards and the philosophers, I read the
histories and hear the stories from dark corners.  I am discontent.  I
must know what is happening.  My people have left their solitude.  I
find myself more and more entering these walled areas and exposing
myself to the cacophony of the lesser races.  Today I find myself in
Thesden.  A strange city.  I shall explore.  I feel compelled.  I should
find others.  Today I have reflected, today I have found a deeper
purpose for House Jhereg.

# Pirates~
`hMuch of the world of Exodus is `ewater`h.  Much of the `ewater`h is untravelled.  Even
those who travel the `ewaterways`h do not usually linger.  Still, the `nsea`h calls
to us as we stand on the balcony of Oseran's lighthouse and look eastward to
the horizon.  It taunts us as we looks south from Thesden's harbors to see
the hills of Ebon Downs far in the distance, obscured by haze.  It intrigues
us as we navigate the lazy tropical rivers from the City of the Sun to the
olive coast.  For us, the `ewaters`h are compelling.  They cannot be resisted.
``
`hWe are the ones who will not live far from `ewater`h, who fall asleep at night to
the sound of crashing waves and the salty smell of the `nsea`h breeze.  We are
the ones who swim out just a little too far, not completely sure if we can
make it back to shore, yet somehow we do.  We watch the sharks, the orca, and
the giant squid from the safety of our ships' decks, knowing that, were we to
fall overboard, the beasts would rip us apart.  For them, we have fear and
respect.  Fear and respect for the deep blue that stretches down further than
the mountains stretch up.  We long to uncover the mysteries that the `nsea`h hides
from our eyes.  As we peer down into the cerulean depths, we dream of the
treasures and wrecks that may be resting on the bottom, perhaps forgotten for
centuries.
``
`a*={=`b====-.`h
``
`hEarly in Thesden's history, a groups of wander-stricken adventurers set out to
see all there was to see of the world.  Initially conquering the lands around
Thesden, they explored to other towns, eventually wandering as far as their
legs could take them.  When they had seen as much as possible by way of land,
they bought what ships they could with their meager earnings and took to the
`nsea`h.  Explorers by trade, they were not above doing whatever it took to come
by the means to travel, including piracy.  Soon, these vagabond sailors had
banded together as a clan known as the Crimson Pirates.  As they mapped and
conquered more of the world, they brought back treasures that made them
powerful and wealthy.  No longer neding to steal and plunder, they kept their
namesake nonetheless as a symbol of pride.
``
`a*={=`b====-.`h
``
`hWe are a PK clan, but playerkilling is the choice of the individual.
We are a neutral clan, and sometimes allow good and evil players as well.
We are, by nature, `nsea`h-oriented, so you should incorporate it into your
character's description, plan, and home, or preferably, into your style of
play.
``
`hThe Pirates are not a very religous group, but months at sea can be humbling
and a cause for fear, so as a result, a set of superstitions has developed,
revolving mostly around gifts or actions that would please `lUlimos`h, the
`nCanthi `kGod `hof the `nSea`h.``

`oIn the early years of Exodus, there were a nameless few who resided 
by the ocean. They were a peaceful group who tried to depend on only
themselves, but when the war of the worlds broke out, they found themselves 
`othe victims of many attacks. Families that walked the fields of the 
`oprairie  were stopped by powerful magic users, charmed and led into the 
ocean to drown, powerless to escape. They grew to detest magic and all 
who used it. As their loved ones lie, barley clinging to life they cried, 
`odesperate to the healers of the land, who merely tuned away too dignified 
`oto save the life of a lesser human. With broken hearts, but determined minds 
they formed a stronger alliance, one which was prepared for the fight against 
magic. Clan Vengeance. They had been wronged once and once was one too 
`omany times. We do not accept apologies or forget our grievances

# fools~
You have undoubtedly heard the rumors.  Old men beating up nobles all
over Thesden.  Small groups of decrepit geezers harrassing would-be
adventurers in the surrounding lands.  Orphans, drunks and destitute widows
receiving gifts of unimaginable splendor from nameless, rasping folk who
disappear without a word into the night.  Fools masses being led by costumed
old women in churches all across the realm.  Some have suggested that a
conspiracy of old war veterans, peeved at the antics of today's youth, is
fomenting revolution.  The clergy claim it is the work of pack of renegade
demented demons, dedicated to the overthrow of the church.  The few sane
people who have been known to comment on the possibly worsening situation
prefer to believe it is the work of a few, unconnected senile old men who
have nothing better to do.  But who really knows?  And if some secret
society of decrepit grandparents does exist, is it really anything to be
concerned about?  Can a bunch of crazy old loons wreak havoc in the land?

only Chaos.  But nothing ever lasts, such as it was with the power of Chaos.
Slowly, Time came creeping upon the harmony of disorder, and brought with it
purpose and need.  It molded the fabric of the universe as it saw fit,
patiently filling the void of uncertantiy with destiny.  Eventually, Time
had won the great war, and Chaos was all but eliminated, until one day... 
In a land that would become known as Exodus, Chaos struck back.  It summoned
five beings of power to ruin the land and drive the forces of order
back into the depths of oblivion from which they came. These five were supreme
beings, nearly as infinite as Chaos itself. But in order to affect reality
they were to be made with the slightest taint of order. They took on
the look of mortals. While their stature was above average, nothing about
their appearance indicated their omnipotence.
        
On the first day, the sky was filled with a rage of orange and red as the five spread
fire and death and blood in all directions, each making his own path of destruction as his
brother made his own in another direction. With a month, the feral world was conquored and
Chaos fired a wave of triumph through the cosmos. Though the land was distrought, the taint
was alive. In the midst of the burning wastelands and open funeral pyres, one of the five felt
the bite of insignificance

# divergent~
Clan Divergent is an ancient, or perhaps modern, affiliation of, for lack
of a better term, anarchists.  The clan's memebrs are devoted, each in her
or his own way, to accelerating the inevitable demise of old, corrupt
orders, rules and superstitions.  Divergent is, in this respect,
destructive, but at it's core it is creative.  The clan supports its members
as they find new paths to tread, new dreams, new visions for the future.

# Escargot~
`a{{{ `h... _`d@`h%            `oClan Escargot`h             ... _`d@`h%  `a}}}``
         
Clan Escargot was formed, some say, as a direct result of the great
god Iverath's absence.  Not long after his departure, strange things
started happening, and people began doing odd things for no apparent
reason.  Experts said that, without Iverath, the total silliness
level of the lands dropped drastically, and these random actions were
the universe's way of compensating.
           
    Whatever the case may be, soon afterwards, a young Elven girl
named Desrielle was visited in visions by a great and powerful god.
This god took the form of a snail, and called himself Biff the
Wonder Snail.  He told Desrielle that it was her destiny to establish
a clan, the likes of which had never been seen in the land before.
This clan, he said, would exist for one purpose and objective only:
                  to be silly.
       
    Almighty Biff saw, in his wisdom, that his children would need
help accomplishing his desires for them... And so he told Desrielle
that the clan would require a few things of its members.  First, they
must generally, but not strictly, be evil, as morals are bad for
serious silliness.  Second, they must be of a race capable of extreme
silliness - Sidhe, though mischievous, are too purely evil to pull
the kinds of pranks that require a group effort - they're simply too
self-serving, Biff told her.  Vro'ath, though silly in their own right,
are simply not intelligent enough to keep up with the demands of the
mind that Clan Escargot would make of them.  And finally, Avatars,
though they can be intelligent and silly, cannot risk themselves in th
ways that true silliness requires.
           
    Biff also decreed that members of Clan Escargot should be
appropriately accented in their speech at all times, and that they
should consider themselves at all times and in all ways exempt from
the laws of society, the government, fair play, and so forth.  The
reason for this, of course, is that laws of any kind only hinder and
discourage silliness.
       
       
Requirements for joinging Clan Escargot:
       
You must be at least level 9 (duh.)
You must be Human, Elf, Syvin, Dwarf, Canthi, or Litan.
You may be of any class.
You must be silly!

# ClubCrazed~
`h.`o:`f|`mTHE STORY`f|`o:`h.``
`aWe are `h.`o:`f|`mThe Crazed`a, kind of heart and strong of will.  However, each of us
is fatally flawed.  Outcast from society, we have taken a solemn oath to 
defend those that have scorned us, to protect those whom cannot protect 
themselves even though they have chosen to cast us aside.
`a
Because of our eccentricities there are none that will step forward to stand 
by our side.  Not the defenders of Brotherhood or the deity worshiping 
Alliant.  We act alone and in the best interest of the free people of the 
realms.  And, though our efforts may garner us little in physical reward, we 
take solace in the fact that each victory may get us that much closer to the 
acceptance that none of us have ever known.
`a
Maybe one day we will walk into Thesden as brothers but until that day comes, 
let evil know that the clean cut defenders of the realms are not their only 
foe.
``
`h.`o:`f|`mREQUIREMENTS`f|`o:`h.``
`aAll of the members of `h.`o:`f|`mThe Crazed`a must make a consistant effort to roleplay 
their character at every moment.  To aid in this, a solid plan and description 
are requirements for acceptance.  These must mesh with the roleplay of the 
clan.
`a
Speaking in fantasy game terms, the roleplay for `h.`o:`f|`mThe Crazed`a is that of 
Neutral/Good.  Think of us as Exodus' version of Robin Hood.  Our goal is the 
protection of the innocent that will hopefully one day lead to our acceptance 
into the society as a whole.
`a
The clan, as a whole, does it's best to see the best in others, excluding very 
few from joining.  All that's required is good roleplay explaining why you are 
the perfect fit for `h.`o:`f|`mThe Crazed`a.  Your reasons for being outcast from 
society can be any of a million things, what matters is you make it an 
interesting part of your character.
``
`h.`o:`f|`mPOLITICAL STANDING`f|`o:`h.``
`aPolitical standing denotes the likelyhood someone in `h.`o:`f|`mThe Crazed`a would have 
of working hand-in-hand with members of other clans based on the clans 
respective roleplays.  It is not ironclad, but a basis to start from.

``
`h.`o:`f|`mThe Crazed`a are most closely related to Forsaken and Escargot in nature.  
Both, however, have often been mistaken for the good people of `h.`o:`f|`mThe Crazed`a 
because of their outcast status or afflictions (mental and physical) and the 
actions of these clans tend to impact the status of `h.`o:`f|`mThe Crazed`a in the eyes 
of the citizans of the realms.  This has lead to a general dislike of both 
clans within the ranks of `h.`o:`f|`mThe Crazed`a.``

# Spyridon~
It was the 23rd day of the Month of the Grand Struggle, year 1689.  The
once powerful King Vrykin of Thesden lead his army through the Black Gates
of Myradia to destroy the evil within, once and for all.  Lord Athanmere,
his brother, lead the royal guard of Thesden to protect the King.  All hope
appeared to be lost for Myradia when the royal guard of Thesden, along with
King Vrykin's troops, swept through Myradia without difficulty.  With a loud
bang, Spyridon the revered Dark Lord came down and called out to his troops
of Myradia, "Stand strong, reap their Spirits, they have got absolutely
NOTHING on you."  With that, the troops of Myradia found themselves winning
and the Kings army retreated.  Spyridon and the troops of Myradia won the
battle.  King Vrykin trained his armies, doubled them in size, feeling the
fate of the evil spirits were done.  Lord Athanmere gained strength in
mystical healing so his troops would be stronger than ever.  Spyridon was
caught off-guard when, all of a sudden, the troops of Thesden barged through
the Black Gates.  Spyridon summoned the evil minions and recalled power
never seen before, he summoned the great reavers of the deepest circle in
hell.  This time, Spyridon would never let Vrykin walk this earth again. 
With a quick slash, King Vrykin's head slid to the ground and the Army of
Thesden surrendered.  The newly proclaimed King Athanmere made a promise to
kill Spyridon and any of his followers.  His followers were enraged.  Most
of the members were have thought to have gone to hell, but this promise
caused all of the evil spirits to rejoice, remembering what they had done to
Vrykin and what was now to be done to King Athanmere...

-
The members of this clan was once forsaken as young by their friends
and families. Their beliefs differred from the society they were living
in. Banished from their homes, with nothing but despair they hid in the 
sewers. After meeting others like them, they began to depend on eachother
for their survival. Combining their knowledge and great strength they 
began to develop a new form of combat. Time passed and they gathered the
courage to reveal their existence to the world. With nearly non-existant 
knowledge about the world above ground they were laughed at, but it came
to an end when they declared war on Thesden and anyone that dared to
oppose them. The war ended very quickly, Thesden had fallen and the clans 
with it. The new rulers of Thesden called themselves the Forsaken
After the great victory they vanished from the face of the earth never to
be seen again and only to be spoken of in legends.
-
Now once again they have returned to the realms of Exodus...

`aClan convicts is for permanently (or near permanently) jailed characters.``

# Minions~
Only a select few are touched by the Great God.  His name is never spoken
and is, perhaps, nonexistent.  The touch, however, is all to obvious. 
Paranoia, madness, psychopathy and dellusions infect the touched like the
bite of a Kalian.  They feel it in their blood, they feel their soul wither
away and the burn of an uncontrolable rage filling its void.  When the Mad
God graces a mortal with his gentle palm, said mortal is set free in a way
he could have never imagined.  All the questions that torment the normal
mind become obsolete as the new born minion opens his third eye.  But the
price of freedom is a heafty one.  Blood must be spilled to quench the
undying thirst of the Great Madened One.  His greed and hunger must be
apiesed as well.  It is to this cause that the Minions seek out the heads of
others.  To the simple, they seem nothing more than mercanaries or bounty
hunters, acting as a catalyst of revenge for those who feel themselves to
pitiful or weak.  But the Fiend of Laughter and his minions know their
purpose is much greater.  Revenge is fueled by hatred, the Lord Slayer is
hatred.  He, through his minions, is able to snake himself ito a world that
claims to reject all that he stands for.  This is why the most ignorant of
the minions call him Sin.  But the wise minion knows that sin is a word
given to an evil act.  Their God is not evil, he is pure and uninhibited. 
Kind and just, for all the worlds beings are suitable candidates for his
cause, be it death or be it life.  
            
The Deliverer will only touch those who are reject by society, therefore
only Assassins who have spent two thirds their life hiding and striking from
the shadows, as well as the recent incursion of Chaos, known as the Jesters
will be admited into Clan Minions. We care not which race you were born,
only your path of life.
         
To slake the greed of He Who Frees, it is the duty of all Minions to seek out
their path into the veins of revenge. Simply put, we minions must kill for
revenge and we may request money, but it is not required of the "client" to
pay. Little does one who seeks our help know, they pay with their soul.

# Advocation~
`gFrom the grand terraces of Ilewyn and the shaded branches of Linden, from
the outlying forests and farms, we came.  We came to Thesden seeking a
better life, and greater opportunities.  We had all heard of grand Thesden
with its streets of gold.  Upon our arrival at the great city, however, we
found the stories of Thesden's grandeur to be misleading at best.  Thesden,
whatever it once might have been, is now crumbling into decadence and decay.
Bandits roam the streets freely, while the town guard looks on unconcerned. 
Dangerous creatures roam the lands around Thesden as well, waiting to devour
the unwary traveler.  Even so, refugees from other lands from to Thesden
daily seeking a new life.  More often than not, they are easy prey for
predators inside and outside the city's walls.  The aristocracy, for some
reason, seems to ignore these ills.  The problems of society are ignored at
best by the ruling class.  At worst, the nobles of the day care nothing for
those under their rule, and crush them down with oppressive edicts and
taxes.  We of Clan Advocation are pledged to help others when we can,
especially those who are new to the lands and less able to fend for
themselves.  We have foresworn violence against other clans and loners. 
Whenever possible, we will do all we can to better the conditions of all
those who walk the path of righteousness.

# Vlades~
Kalians have been hiding among the people for untold centuries. Masking
themselves within the night so no one could see the truth. Keeping their lives
hidden from the prying eyes of the world. Almost all people only knew them
as rumors and fairy tales. Until the discovery of the Isle of the dead. Now 
word has spread in the realm as more and more kalians come out from
their hiding within the darkness. A sense of fear has quickly spread among 
the people. Warnings of walking alone in the night. As well as boarding up 
windows and doors when dusk approaches. Recently a banner hung in blood 
over the fountain of the well renowned Devon Square Center has been marked by 
something new rising within the night. Dwellers of the darkness banding 
together against the day, revealing themselves as the Vlades. The evening
sky is no longer a safe haven for which to walk under. And the streets are
unsafe to stroll under the glow of the lamplight.
Take heed, they come to devour.
   
Clan Requirements:
Must be of the Kalian or Lich race.
Must be at least level 50, exceptions may be made for special cases.
Must have swimming at 100%
If Kalian, must have fear at 80%

# soulstorm~
`aSoulstorm
`a
From the depths of `ih`bel`il `acrawled the hordes of soulless and soulthirsty
soldiers.  At first, there was chaos, and then...  A storm began to
brew.  This `bstorm `aof `ide`bmo`ins `aat first glance was but a dot on the
horizon, growing every hour until it had blanketed Exodus in darkness.
`a
This `barmy `aof `bdarkness`a now rules the realm with a `ccold`a, `obony`a fist.
`a
They `kbow to no god, evil or good`a... For with no soul, you have no fear
of the afterlife.  `kEthics and morals are trivial`a... The only thing that
matters is the thirst for `bsouls `aand the overwhelming need for `bpower`a.
`a
There is no enemy too weak, and no adversary too strong.  They move as
an army, and destroy everything and everyone who is in their path.
`a
At times they may forge an alliance, but only with creatures as dark
and vicious as themselves, and only temporarily to attain what they
desire.
`a
If you'd like to join the soulstorm, you must first and foremost be:
`a
A reaver of any bloodline, and hungry for souls, or
A lich, dead on the inside, and dead on the out... A soulless creature
`a  for sure.
`a
`a
`a
The cost is great, but the reward is greater for joining the army.``

# Parlous~
`i Centuries ago in `oEbon Downs `aassassins `itrained for many hours,
all day and all night, till the crickets were chirping and making music into
the night sky.  `` `iAfter years of training the best of the `aassassins
`ibanded together with particularly gifted `athieves `iand made their way
towards the city of `kThesden`i.  `` `iAlong the way they stumbled upon a
young woman with long, pitch-black hair and surrounded in a cloud of `adark
`imist.  She smiled at them, her ancient eyes telling the stories of life
and death.  `` `iThe young `knecromancer `ijoined their ranks and continued
with them to their destination.  `` `i Once in `kThesden `ithey spread out
to find more men and women who practiced the same dark arts and trickery. 
`` `iThey established `aclan Parlous`i: where `aAssassins`i, `aThieves`i,
and `kNecromancers `iare welcome to practice their skills and dark magic
without being persecuted, and `bKalians `iof all classes are welcome into
their ranks.  `` `iThe leader of the clan held rank for about a year before
mysteriously disappearing into the `bshadows `ibeyond the borders of `lLunar
Plains`i.  `` `iThe clan quickly fell into disrepair everyone moving in
different directions, killing other clan members at randomly, attempting to
take leadership but constantly failing.  `` `iWhen the overwhelming scream
of death erupted from `bDharkhum `ithe entire clan stopped to stare in awe. 
A tall, strong man with glistening muscles rippling in strength walks into
town, carrying the `obody `iof `bDharkhum`i.  `` `iHe throws the slain
dragon down at the doorway of the Parlous clan door, and ignoring the
`iastonished looks of the clan members he walks through without a backward glance. 
rank instantly.  `` `iHe brought Parlous to a new height of prestige, and he
expanded the clan by seeking out skilled `aassassins`i, `athieves`i,
`knecromancers`i, and `bKalians `iwho showed promise early on.  ``
`iAlthough `aclan Parlous `imostly preferred to kill the clean-cut clan
members, such as `oAlliant `iand `oBrotherhood`i, they were not opposed to
lashing out to people who held no affiliation, and would do so for no
reason,`` `iif not to prove their skills or to simply enjoy the screams of a
dying man.  `i Today the same young man runs `aParlous`i, and his clan
continues to grow.  He still holds onto the original policies of the clan:
you must be an `aAssassin`i, `aThief`i, `kNecromancer`i, or `bKalian `iof
any class.  `` `iYou must be willing to kill without structured reason, and
always be willing to fight and die for the cause.  ``

# Quicksand~
`d \Quick"sand`\, n.  Sand easily moved or readily yielding to pressure;
especially, a deep mass of loose or moving sand mixed with water, sometimes
found at the mouth of a river or along some coasts `d , and very dangerous,
from the difficulty of extricating a person who begins sinking into it.  
`c-
`aLife hath quicksands, `c-- `aLife hath snarls! `c-- `oLongfellow
`c-
`oThe long and blood soaked story of the quicksand takes us back to a simpler time, when the city streets were safe to go take a stroll at night, and thesden was a prospering beacon of truth and justice.
`oIt was at this time, that a new evil first lurked about the harbors of Thesden, bringing with them the foul and crude ways from the lands across the ocean, they had brought with them the mighty hero Kryian, and several other powerful warriors.
`oBut all was not lost, still one clan, noble and honorable, `cGreen`dWood `oresisted such evil ways. The pirates were fierce and many a life was lost, until we discovered the horrible properties of the `dQuicksand`o.
`oPirates who once thought that perhaps, the sand and water were their home now feared to be summoned through arcane portals and gates to be slaughtered, not being able to move, nor defend themselves.
`oThe quicksand quickly became known as the `cGreen`dWood `okilling grounds, it was discussed with horor with `cGreen`dWood's `oenemies, as a place where the `bTricky-multi-kill `oand the `bWant a summon back to your corpse `okill were invented.
`oThe days passed, and the memory of the quicksand was now no longer discussed, in fact no longer used, the enemies and even the allies of `cGreen`dWood `otaunted us. It was at this time when the memory of the quicksand was resurrected.
`oRegen, along with his fellow clanmate Entangler had had enough of the allies taunts, and decided to live the dream of the quicksand, the pure laming pk life style. 
`c-
`bTo join you must be lame, must be level 50+ (exceptions might be made) - you can be of any race or class, barring vro'ath who are too simple minded to be lame. 
`c-
`kConcerning our alliance with Jhereg, we have found another clan, who often relies on their ability to kill with or without eq, Entangler and I were very impressed with this and so the alliance was sealed.

# Alliant~
`o==(`k@`o)== `hThe Holy Alliant Order `o==(`k@`o)== 
       
`hA long time ago, when the old gods left the land, murder and destruction 
left its mark on the land as the `borcs `hand the `bvro'aths`h ran rampant.  The city 
of Thesden could barely withstand the fierce onslaught of forces far superior 
to the armies of the humans. 
       
The roads became unsafe.  All cities were surrounded and famine spread its 
evil arms, embracing the people in hopelessness and despair.  The `oKnights of the 
Argent Lance`h fought bravely together with the Thesden guards to drive out 
the vicious hordes, but to little avail.
       
No one knows where they came from.  Riding great warhorses and with lances bright 
and innumerable, a charge swept the outskirts of the city like a tidal wave, driving 
away the vro'aths and leaving destruction in its wake.  Many they were, noble 
with grim faces from which the orcs ran away in terror.  They bore great silver 
shields and smote their enemy with the sheer power of their armor, their swords long 
and deadly with blinding rays from above. 
           
Many vro'aths fell during this first assault. The remaining few, not willing to 
withdraw from their hated enemies, gathered round their banner of crimson red and 
withstood their ground.  The echoes of battle rang far and away. 
        
Filled with battle lust, the Argent Lance Knights`h exited the city on foot to fight 
the remnants of the evil army together with these unknown holy warriors.  Together, 
they drove the enemy away with great loss. 
           
`oThe Holy Alliant Order`h thus established themselves in Thesden, and from there, great 
campaigns against the vroaths were planned.  Slowly the land was returned to 
peace, and trade began to flourish again. 
      
In Thesden, the White Tower was constructed to house the `oKnights of the Alliant order`h, 
who swore alliance to the king.  Many youngsters applied as squires and apprentices 
in the hope of becoming paladins and priests.  The order grew at an impressive rate. 
Now... evil is spreading and the order is facing many struggles.  The King was 
assassinated and an impostor occupies his place.  The Order will not carry the will 
of the Assassin, so it faces prosecution.  Their friendship with the Argent Lance 
is broken, and many of their main members have been murdered.  Will the Holy Order find 
the support of the `oAlmighty`h to derogate the king and defeat evil once again? 
                
`c
Requirements
-------------------------- 
         
It is required that all members adopt a last name and a shield-of-arms, to be 
submitted to the clan leader, as well as a detailed description.  A plan is also 
welcomed. 
        
The RP is that of a Lawful Good.  PK is allowed, and even promoted, in case of evil 
clans or vroaths, our main enemies.  However, looting is not allowed, and a decent 
and chivalrous behavior is expected even when facing enemies 
        
Even though the clan is lawful good, it may seem racist as they distrust elves 
and most sentient races.  Their religion is strict and monotheistic.  They 
recognize an Almighty god.  All other gods are demons in the view of the RP. 
It is expected of the clan members to help people in distress.
