Amber
witch:<7:-:She seeks a wand of legend.  If you ask she says it was hers, and the wizard took it.  But that's not what he says...; CMD emote trails off, shaking his head.
wizard:<7:-:He is so angry over the loss of that wand!  It was his most precious possesion until the witch took it.  Though she claims it was hers first.  Who to believe?; CMD roll
pixie:<7:-:A bad, nasty, mean, wretched creature!; CMD spit; It loves evil and mischief and will steal all you have if you let it.  I don't know why some people come here just to see it.
will-o-wisp|wisp:<7:-:That is what first led me into this forest!  It taunted me, daring me to touch it.  I gave chase, abandoning my comrades.  Several more times I saw it and swung my sword, but I am never able to touch it...; CMD sigh
brownie:<7:-:A tiny brownie wanders alone here somewhere, playing a sad song on his little silver flute.  He is the last of his kind and very grateful for company.  Unfortunately almost no one looks close enough to see him.; CMD shake
unicorn:<7:-:CMD swoon; That is the vision I constantly seek.  I glimpsed it once at midnight, standing near a clear pond.  When I approached it vanished into the moonlight.; CMD sigh; The image of that creature haunts me day and night.  I can't rest until I find it!
hi|hello|hey:<7:-:CMD peer $name; Ahh! Another poor soul lost in this endless forest.  Which of the fleeting, troublesome `lcreatures`k do YOU seek?
story|creatures:<7:-:So many strange things I have seen here... the `lwitch`k and the `lwizard`k always fighting.  The `lbrownie`k, the `lpixie`k, and the `lwill-o-wisp`k.  And the one I yet seek- the `lUnicorn`k!
