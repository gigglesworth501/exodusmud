Subject Kaeleb / Tygre -- OOL killing in the Pub~
Text
As investigated by Tarant, verified by ClairdeLune and admitted by
Kaeleb, Kaeleb killed Tygre in the Pub using charmies in retaliation
for Tygre using the Pipers Melody on him.  In spite of the fact that
Kaeleb initiated the attack and because one of his charmies made the
killing blow on Tygre, Kaeleb lost no levels although there is
approximately 20 levels difference between his and Tygre's level.

I explained to Kaeleb that his attacking Tygre was not an appropriate
response to being Pipered if he expected not to receive a level loss
for killing Tygre.  He could have teleported himself and could have
gotten away easily.
I have demoted him by 3 levels today due to this killing.
In addition, before this killing in the Pub, I was not aware that the
Pub was not Justice flagged.  That has been changed.  All of Thesden,
to my knowledge has been so flagged, and every room in the Exodus
Homelands area should be similarly flagged.
Please be aware that the Pub is now Justice flagged and any killings
occurring in there will be treated in the same manner as killings done
in the Thesden streets.

The spam was truly annoying and I wished at that time that
I had some sort of means at my disposal with which I might rid Exodus of 
this annoying spammer (hint). Anyways, Serena got mad and killed
Esk in town. Esk was not slowed down. He continued to spam terribly.
He said that he was going to rape everyone over ooc. And he also
boasted that he would 'hack this mud.' The spam continued for a minute or two

Subject Willy/Dizz and Grog~
Text
I caught Willy transferring good equipment, including two quest tokens,
to his other character Dizz, by means of Grog, who may or may not be an
another alt of Willy's. [Willy denied being the controller of Grog, saying that
Grog's controller was his friend who lived down the hall.] I confronted Dizz
and Grog after Grog had given Willy's equipment to Dizz. There seemed to be some
delay in responses between the two characters. I suspect Willy is also the 
controller for Grog, but I'm not certain. In any case, I told Dizz that it is
illegal to transfer equipment between alts through a third party. He didn't
give me any trouble and agreed to give the equipment back to Willy, which
he did. I warned him not to do it again. I am not asking for any punishment,
since I have no way of proving whether Grog is also controlled by Willy.
Therefore, I believe that a warning is sufficient for this first offense.
Willy's excuse for his actions: He wanted to keep Willy's equipment safe
from potential killers and looters of Willy, by giving the gear to Dizz,
apparently a character with a lesser risk of getting looted.

Yeah, that's really borderline Multiplay.  I still want to see him
nailed, however, for killing Sabor.
Under the 'Look Cheating' section of the current rules, doing anything
to a linkdead player is against the rules.  Now, if Sabor had a linkdead
flag, I think Garland should be punished.  If Sabor didn't have the flag
at that point, then I don't think anything should happen to Garland.
I, myself, have killed linkdead players with my morts... but only
before the mud registered them as linkdead with a visible flag.

Garland's a tough one.  He walks a very narrow, grey line in regards
to pkilling.  He often logs on with one character then quits when he
finds or locates his prey, only to log on with one of his heavy hitters.
Keep an eye on him.  He HAS been known to pass equipment between his
characters.  I'm sure we can probably catch him on that again.  The 
last time he did that, I froze him for a month.

Was a level 4 mage, who attempted to steal from a level 8 noclan.

Text
Sneaky killed Lyntt in town at the entrance to the Cathederal and hid inside the Harris Mansion while he had a wanted flag.
He repeatedly would go linkdead so he wouldn't have to sit out his flag.
Each time he'd do that, I'd force him to quit.  Soon after he would log
right back on again and then go linkdead.
I varied the times just to make sure his going linkdead was not legitimate.
Sure enough... right after each and every time I'd force him to quit
he'd log right back on, even if I'd wait 5 minutes to force quit him or
if I force quit him right away.
Anyway, this got tiring, so every time he played this game, I'd up the
ticks on his wanted flag by 25.  He's up to like 400 ticks right now.
If you see him go linkdead while wanted, please 'disconnect Sneaky'.
Purposely going linkdead while wanted defeats the purpose of the flag and
really is the wusses way out.

I have logs of Famine in the act of duplicating runes with this Danath
person mentioned in previous notes.  I want all of Famine's alts frozen

and desecrate/sanctify areas with them, as well as make a quick buck.
He's been in the penalties over and over and over again and has played
here for quite some time.  He knows the rules and knows what happens when
one breaks one.
I'm convinced from previous snoops that Garland and Harris both are aware of
what was going on.  However, they were not involved.  They chose to 
not come forward instead.  That being the case, I want every last rune
on a Divergent member taken and eaten.  That's for 2 reasons:  1)
I don't honestly know how many runes are on divergent alt pfiles.  They
all have a ton of alts.  Second, they should have come forward if they
knew about it.  Sadly, I don't have a log showing the conversation, however
I did see Harris' alt Dracula encourage Famine to go on this rune crusade.
That being the case, I'm not going to stress myself or any other imm over
whether Divergent has the correct number of runes and/or are they legal.
Eat them all.  They can start from scratch, since they knew what they were

Ok, lennon was on and this time I wasn't taking chances on him bailing.
So I slew him and then talked to him.  Jailed him right after that and then he bailed.
I'm still *not* 100 % sure he looted locke but it sure looks that way.
Locke is willing to give Lennon's eq back.  I have the eq locke was carrying.
Fun, fun, fun... ;-)
I think I'll wait a little before I give this eq to Locke.  I want
to hear Locke's side. by the way he used two sockets
a military one and erassmus.erols.com, I'll check my log for exact sockets.
We now return you to your regularly scheduled programming.

Text
Was accused of escaping from jail by mass telepathing Vantage.
He killed himself from telepath burn.
When I logged on as Moonlyte to check his stats, I noticed that he was
nochannelled, which is a good indicator that he escaped jail.
When I jailed him, he wound up in his original cell, as his corpse was
still lying there.  I've extended his jail time from 55 ticks to 80.
I told him that no, telepath burn is not a bug, but the rules clearly
state that escape from jail is unacceptable.
Please keep an eye open for this kind of behavior and also for going

I was thinking over that last penalty about level loss.  We usually do that
when a mage kills someone with charmies.. or a bard does, and they avoid
level loss that way.  Those are legal pkills, but the level loss did not
occur because the code doesn't recognize the charmies as being grouped
with the master, when assigning level loss penalties.
However, this was an illegal pkill that was also OOL too, wasn't it?
That being the case, could you please jail Dakeru after you lower her 
level?   Jail for the indirect part - level loss for OOL x 2 chars.

A log can be provided as testimony to what happened, should anyone
be interested.

Grathix is frozen. I apologize for not catching his exact

Why I am so sure of that can be supported by Grathix's behavior.
First, he asked me to tell him his own socket. What kind of newbie
asks THAT? I did NOT tell him. I did look at his socket, however,
and can only remember "1Cust... ... ...uu.net"
I should have written it down. Simeon snooped him and saw him fingering
immortals (this was before he was frozen, of course).

Circumstantial evidence? Maybe. But I mustremind you that I saw about
9 or 10 alts of Telos logged in all at once, a couple of days ago.
Ophidias, Telos, UndeadMorian, Aahz, Morianne, and a few others.
They all had the "1Cust... ... ...uu.net" socket. Perhaps that is why
I didn't bother to write down the exact socket. Grathix's looked so familiar
it just triggered an automatic psychological response on my part.
When he asked for his own socket, that sealed it... in my mind, it's him.

If I am wrong, I will do anything to amend the situation.

Were caught multiplaying.  Shallownight says that his "mate" down

both chars while Whitey was working or whatever.
I confiscated Whitey's stuff (unbeknownst to him) and then froze him
after telling him why.  Shallow got away.  Soooooooo....
if you see Shallow, stick him in the cooler for one week as a 1st

Subject Indirect pk - Oro~
Text
Note to Immortal pretty much describes what happened.
Oro summoned Dakeru with the intention of sleeping her although
she was OOL.  That's not illegal.  However, upon being summoned
someone (we can't agree on if it was Jeannne or Sith) killed Dakeru.
The four people involved seem to agree that this wasn't premeditated.
However, the facts are simple:  Dakeru would not have died at that
time had Oro not summoned her.  Period.
Because this whole thing is grey, this is the first time Oro was 
caught indirect pk'ing, that his motives seem "pure" in this 
instance, we've just jailed him.  There was no level loss.
Shinowlan who was here when all of this took place, concurred with
my decision before we jailed oro and the note was posted.

watch a little longer and try talking to both and freeze, if necessary.

Ok, cancel that...  I talked to both of them and was getting simultaneous replies
from each.  What Crovax said was that he was over at a friend's showing him the
mud which can explain most of the multiplay symptoms.  Then he went home and

he admitted that he summoned Zank and he also acknowledged that he
was aware that Zank had a wanted flag.  His reason for summoning
Zank was that "He wanted to look at him, since he was a loner".  
He also claimed that on OOC Zank had been talking about killing "someone"

Valgard indicated that he was surprised Zank was jailed "so quickly"
I stated that I wasn't happy with that explanation and said he 
said "Fine, punish me".  Before I could do anything else he started
spamming delete (I had him snooped).  I don't think he knew what he was doing because
it took him several tries before he used his password with the 
command.  He then deleted his character.  I feel bad as
this might have truly been an oversight (getting zank jailed)
but Valgard reacted so quickly that I didn't have a chance
to do anything.  
I would like some feedback on whether giving him a loner

He has gone on a wild and reckless killing spree through

When approached by an immortal, he has quit, on several occasions.

Spoke to Stix about Craeat.  He owned up to the whole thing.
Of course, nothing is easy -- there's a twist to this
whole thing.  Stix says that when he realized that he
didn't lose a level, he summoned Craeat back and killed him
himself to lose exp.  This sounds extremely suspicious to me.
I told him that if Craeat wants us to give Stix his levels
back, I'd do so.  It's one thing when you realize that you
didn't lose levels from a pkill and there isn't an imm 
around to fix the situation with an immwrath character.
Then, it'd be understandable if that character ALLOWED you
to kill them again just for the level loss reasons.  However,
a kill that's not allowed seems like a possible multikill just
for the hell of it.  SO, depending on what Craeat says
(whether hte kill was something intentional and allowed by him
or something that was done on the spur of the moment without
warning -- aka a regular pkill), I'll either give Stix
his levels back or not.  As it is, I had him kill immwrathfive

Since it was my note that Xork acted upon when he froze Stix, I felt
a little responsible when Dude asked me why Stix got frozen.
I thought we were still in the debate stage and not the actual
penalty stage yet. So, I let Stix out of the freezer and made him
lose a level, which he would have lost had he directly killed Kain.
Since Xork was unable to convey a punishment to Stix, I thought
this was appropriate for the time being, keeping in mind that
I just froze another alt of his for a month. Maybe I'm getting soft.
But until the rules are clarified on indirect pk, I will continue
to find such judgements difficult to make.
I think this case should be considered closed. Stix is free,
having received a level loss. If a pattern of this behavior shows
itself in Stix, then he should be frozen for the next offense.

Orath OOL pkilled Dakeru, a noclan and then swore over OOC. He claims the PK was a typo.

I know that I said I wasn't going to get involved, but I couldn't just stand by and do nothing.

Dakeru had just been killed by a Bodyguard, which then looted her eq. Oroth was supposedly trying to
help her out, and typo'd his opening song, and attacked Dakeru instead of the bodyguard.
Dakeru died, and Oroth cursed over OOC. I transed them both to my room. Oroth seemed to feel very
bad about this, and his story seemed likely enough (although how do you mistype dak instead of bod?)..
Dakeru was rather anoyed overall, which is to be expected. I could not just let someone go completely
unpunished for killing a noclan, mistake or not, and the only person that knows for sure if it was a mistake
is Oroth. I jailed him, for standard jail time for the pkill, and he is not to be reimbursed levels lost. For cursing
over public channel, I nochanneled him for 2 weeks. Please lift the nochannel when the 2 weeks is up.

Additional note... I honestly believe that it was a mistake, or I would have frozen him for a very long time...
There is no excuse for killing a noclan. They stay out of clans to stay out of pkill.
At the same time, if we were to reimburse his levels and let him get away with it basically scott free, who's
to say we won't have everyone killing noclans and saying they were trying to help? Xork was present
during the whole process, if there are any questions as to the situation.

that he could remake the character and gather the character's stocked
equipment and deposited cash.  

When you think of how easy it is to go and kill a bunch of noclans

remake the character and gather all of his gear, money and use the 
character's rooms that have already been made) it seems that
some sort of justice is lacking.  I mean, it defeats the purpose of
a permanent freeze.  Taking all of this into account, I've denied

The character GhostMorian has been mobbed.

This is the policy regarding the player who plays the 'Morian' characters and
alts:  

If you can confirm beyond a doubt that whatever character is controlled by
the above mentioned player, let me know and we'll work on taking action
(such as permafreeze or better yet character denial).
The trouble with both the 'freeze' and 'deny' commands is that 
the character in question must be played at the time those commands are
typed.

As far as the policy goes... it isn't always so easy to prove who
is who sometimes on this MUD.  An example of this is Tigger & Stix.
We've all discussed those two characters (and other alts) in detail,
and even now we can not name all of the alts that are used in 
that particular family.  Likewise, it isn't always so easy to point
out a Morian alt.  In order to deny those characters we have to
be sure beyond a doubt that he is really 'Morian' before we take
action (which is far from easy sometimes and very frustrating).

In any case, let me or LW know if you suspect that you've found a

Xeroth had his autoloot set, so upon killing Selfton who was

When Selfton came back, demanding his stuff back, Xeroth willingly 
dropped the stuff, and Selfton's Globe of Anti-Magic disintegrated.

(Tigger or Morian), then he can look at a freeze or denial next time for

Somewhere during the whole exchange, he managed to have Xeroth dismount.
When he ordered all of his charmies to attack the dragon, it wound up that
Xeroth was the only one in the room with him.  He tried to 'order all rescue Xeroth'
however there was no one in the room to rescue Xeroth.  Xeroth's dragon made
short work of him.

This does seem to be a case of indirect pk.

I talked to both Xeroth and Doric.  Doric owned up to the story and gave me
most of the story's details.  He told me that he deserved any punishment
that was given him.  I came up with the following:
I transferred Doric in to visit Shenlon, to show him what it's like to be
indirectly pk'd.  His corpse is still there.
When I was talking to him on the altar, he asked about freezing since this 
technically was an indirect pk situation.  I transferred Xeroth onto the 
Altar with Doric to discuss the situation and to tell him what I did already
(regarding Shenlon).  He agreed with me that if this was an accidental thing
and he felt that it was, a freezing wasn't necessary and that the transfer
to Shenlon was fair.  Doric agreed.
Doric said he'll be more careful what he does next time (as he lost his best
set of gear to Shenlon).

Alls well that ends well I guess.  *shrug* :)

I noticed that Mendou and Nuu were on at the same time with

After Mendou killed the mobs, he gave some coins to Nuu.
At this point I showed myself and asked what was going on.
After a long pause, Mendou emoted, "Mendou sorry forgot nuu was on,
meant to close him," which is complete bs. Not only did Mendou go
directly to the room in the eastern prairie where Nuu was, but he
gave his alt coins, too! How do you forget that an alt is on while

Subject Turbo:  bug abuse~
Text
Turbo used 'Despair of Orpheus' to initiate attacks in Thesden.  Unfortunately
the mud does not currently recognize that song as being aggressive in nature.
Brieault of Twilight was jailed and lost all of his gear.  I'd like anyone who
gets a request from him for a reimb to do so.  After the Brieault incident I
spoke to Turbo about the Despair thing and told him that if he used the song to
get someone jailed again, I would give his corpse to that person as payment.
He was fine with that and then later moved on with the song to not only cause
Gort to be wanted/jailed several times, but also caused him to lose several levels
as well on at least 3 if not more occassions.  It was at that time that I first
lowered Turbo's Despair percentage to 1% and then took it away altogether after
he used it on Gort even at 1%.  Once taken away, he used Song of Elyteness to
initiate attacks against Gort and get Gort wanted/jailed in the same manner.
It was at this time that I slayed the then AFK Turbo, gave his corpse to Gort
(because Gort's stuff was looted from donation) and then froze him.
Turbo is to be frozen for two weeks for bug abuse.  If it happens again, he will
be frozen for a month, with the next incident resulting in character denial.

Please keep your eyes open for further incidents of this type of abuse going on.
Bugs aren't posted because we don't want people abusing them.  If someone uses
'Despair' to cause someone's weapon to drop (which is a legitimate use of the song)
and didn't realize of the other consequences of their actions, let them off.
However, if it happens repeatedly, you have my support in freezing the person
or jailing them or doing whatever you think is prudent based on who you are
dealing with.  As far as Turbo losing Despair, getting slayed and then frozen,
I felt it was necessary based on that he logged in from Tigger's socket and
appears to be one of Tigger's alts (who should definitely know better).

Any questions can be addressed to me at any time.

Text
Symon was nochannelled today due to repeated harrassment of Augustus 
through tells, says, shouts and over public channels.  Additionally,
he ooc'd what Augustus says was his RL address.
I don't know whether the address was really Augustus' address or not.

The facts are, however, that Augustus asked me to snoop him and I saw repeated
tells from Symon after Augustus asked him to stop.
When confronted, Symon claimed that it was Augustus who was harrassing Usban
and himself.  Usban was also on a rant regarding Augustus harrassing him
however, I have no conclusive evidence of this.  
When snooped afterwards, Usban sent Symon a tell that the whole thing was fun.
Augustus seemed pretty upset.

Anyway, after being nochannelled, notelled and noshouted for 2 weeks for me
catching him harrassing Augustus, Symon was transferred to Devon Square where
he promptly began harrassing Nano in says after she repeatedly asked him to
stop.
He was promptly slayed by me, frozen and transferred to 1227.  The freeze is
for one month.

As for Usban, I'm very wary of him.  I don't know what problem Augustus has
with them and vice versa, however, I do know that they handled their claim

Subject Gorak's latest note re: Riley~
Text
After a little research on the host, I have discovered that Riley has
been coming off the same socket as Usban (see previous penalty re: Symon).
I have no reason to doubt Gorak what-so-ever.  Harrassment is a very
serious thing.  To top it off, Usban and company are using the same MO as
they used the other night -- in accussing other people of pedophilia... etc.

I have never heard of blast.net before.  As such, it is now permanently
sitebanned.  If the banning becomes a problem and affects too much of the
player base, I will remove it.

As for Symon's socket, it's a little tougher to ban, as I believe there
are a couple of other people who come off the mindspring IP.  If I find
it necessary to ban Symon, I will search for other alternatives before 
banning that IP.

I just removed a note that out and out flamed Moskha.  This type of thing

Exodus, flaming is not.  Perhaps that violates the 1st ammendment, however,
this is a game on which international users play and as such the rules and
laws of this realm are not the same as RL countries.

Anyway, Psylent has been mobbed until I can talk to him about his use of the

aren't flames of people in the future, he can have his character back.

Xeroth's alt, Augustus, finally decided to approach me on the matter of 
killing a noclan and saccing her corpse.  A log supported this as well as
witnesses.  Additionally, Xeroth has admitted to this most heinous of acts.
I have spoken to Xeroth on the matter and have decided a one week jail sentance
of approximately 10080 ticks of jail time, is appropriate.  The way the code
runs now, if he goes linkdead, that tick timer stops.  If he multiplays, 
that should be evident.  In any case, he will need to have a live connection
to Exodus under that character for 10080 ticks.  What gear he had was automatically
put in donation when I jailed him.

I have also written a warning note to him regarding his actions.  If this
is done again by any of his alts (if I'm sure he owns the alt), then they
will be denied on the spot for good.

This player was very aware of the rules and whether his reasons behind the
killing of the noclan was RL or RP based is irrelevant.  

I do not expect a repeat performance from this person.

Text
I caught Paarshad running a bot this morning.  He was using it to simply keep
himself on-line.  His bot would type 'unread' to keep him from getting sucked
into the void, and he would fish in the Jhereg well when he became hungry.
Jhereg also has two indoor water sources, so he had no problem getting a drink
either.

I decided since he wasn't using a bot to level or pk and just to keep him
logged on, I would let his fate be decided by himself.
I set his hunger and thirst to 1, transferred him to the haystack inside of
the abbey and told him where he was.  At that point, he has plenty of time
to get back to town (and his clan hall) to get something to eat and drink.

If he dies and loses his corpse, that was decided by him through his actions.
If he manages not to die and/or get his corpse back, we'll call him lucky.

Subject Ravla killing linkdead noclan Lauras~
Text
Investigated Lauras' accusation that Ravla killed her while she was
linkdead. I spoke with her witness Eraser, and both of their stories
matched. Also, their stories fit in with the facts that I could detect.
While Lauras, a non-lonered noclan, was linkdead in Thesden, Ravla
killed her for an unknown reason. He killed her knowing she was linkdead.
He was jailed by the code. This is all according to the statements of
Lauras and Eraser. When I investigated further, I found Ravla, a loner,
linkdead in jail.
I increased his jail sentence to 2000 ticks, for killing a noclan while
linkdead, a doubly bad infraction.

I reimbursed Lauras' missing gear.

Subject Eraser and MrEvil/Kerberos illegally passing gear~
Text
I caught Kerberos passing gear to his alt, MrEvil, by way of
Eraser. Both of them plead guilty to the infraction. They also
admitted to sharing passwords. FYI, these two are members of the
Swedish element here at Exodus. The person playing Kerberos denied
ownership of the character, claiming to be Caliban in reality.
Apparently he was just borrowing Kerberos for some illegal fun.
So I set MrEvil's sentence at 3000 ticks. Eraser has 1750 ticks.
Caliban is on final warning. If any of his alts cheat again,
I would like to see that character mobbed or deleted.

This area is very grey.  Solemn says that he did kill Dijo twice.  The first time

his corpse (lances and javelins) and then stood outside of his clan hall.
Although he says that not enough time went by for him to heal without sleeping,
sufficient time went by for him to heal had he been sleeping.

In the end, after hearing the testimony of Dijo and others who heard about the
matter on OOC but did not eye witness it, I have come to the conclusion that this
is a case of multikill and have jailed Solemn.  However, I have jailed without
tweaking the ticks.  This can stand as a warning to him to be more careful in
the future, and yet does not unduly punish him for someone armed, standing outside
of his hall to heal.

to take it off public channels, he ignored the request.  I logged Silveria on and

For several nights Lame has not only gone about penises and testicles through
open channels, but also through his title.  After being sick of talking to him
time and again, slaying him, nochannelling him... etc., I have decided to permanently
make him a female.  Please do not change this character's sex back.

If he continues abusing his title or offends anyone on channels, please feel free
to notitle him, nochannel him... etc.

Soon after the last penalty was posted, Lame started in with putting derrogatory
remarks in his title regarding female genitalia.  As such, I notitled him and
changed his title to '<----------DORK' (blinking), as an imprompteau DORK flag.
Feel free to remove the notitle restriction if and when any of you have any mercy
for him.

Subject Kracken - Drowning Mobs / Torn - Multiplay~
Text
Discovered Kracken in a room today, with Bluesilver and Eyunel who were drowning.
Kracken was sitting in the water flagged room, repeatedly checking on the number
of ticks of his aqua breathe, while he looked at the mobs to check their condition.
When approached about this he said he wanted to see who would die first.

I jailed him, informing him that it was illegal to drown mobs with the consolation
that as he had only been wanted once before, he wouldn't be in jail for long.
(Not long being, 5-10 rl minutes.)

He was jailed (no one was on at the time), and immediately logged off.  He
logged Torn on, started swearing on channels and then logged off again when
I told him that if he would just stay on as Kracken, he would be out of jail
very, very soon.   He took my advice and logged Kracken back on.

Another player logged onto the MUD and Kracken logged his alt Torn on.  I 
asked Torn if he was aware he was multiplaying and he affirmed this by saying
that he would not let 6 months of hard work go down the tubes.  Torn was jailed.
At that point, taking into account what appeared to be cheating, channel abuse
and blatant multiplay, I froze them both once they were released from jail.
As a courtesy to them, both were allowed to have their gear back, of which
nothing seems to be missing.

The freezing will be for two weeks and will end on August 26.

Subject Multiplay / Bug Abuse - Kerberos / Raze Lestath / Exorcist / Darkus~
Text
The character Kerberos has been deleted for repeated multiplay infractions.
Please refer to penalty #'s 573, 583 and 626.  This was the fourth time
he was caught multiplaying.  In this instance, he acted as a third party to
pass Shards of Vengeance from Lestath to Darkus, in addition to object #99
(a decapitated head) from Exorcist to Raze.  Acting as a third party to pass
gear is specifically stated in the rules as illegal.  He has been spoken to
about repeatedly and has shown a disregard for the rules and the players of
Exodus.

Additionally, Raze and Kerberos duplicated a ring of the sun god, phoenix claws,
a suit of armor and Chivalry's Diamond armor through a crash, as well as 
60k Gold and 218k Silver.  Raze has been slain, purged, and frozen for one
month, in addition to having his box purged.  The Diamond armor that he
duplicated and stocked in his store has been confiscated and eaten.

The character Lestath has been slain, purged and frozen for one month for
the passing of gear through Kerberos to Darkus, namely in the form of illegal
equipment belonging to clan Revolution.  The current clan leader of Revolution
has been informed that Lestath is giving their gear to non-Revolution members.
Similarly, the character Darkus has also been slain, purged and frozen for
one month for the same infraction.

Exorcist has been slain, purged and frozen for one month for passing the 
decapitated head to Raze through Kerberos' intervention.

Dogmai, for receiving illegal gear in the form of a Parlous Shadow Sai and
a Revolution Shard, (the Sai from Shagath and the Shard from Darkus), has had
the illegal equipment seized.  His benediction of evil was eaten in response.

Similarly, Shagath, for still having one more Parlous Shadow Sai stocked in 
his store, has also had the Sai seized and his anaconda leggings eaten as a 
penalty.

A 5+ Megabite log file detailing all of these infractions can be supplied by
me at any immortal's request.  However, it is not for the viewing of mortals,
as it lists detailed information about other players sockets, locations of
equipment all over Exodus... etc., in addition to other senstive information.

Clarification:  Kerberos was deleted and mobbed.  His stores and player box
were purged and all rooms belonging to him have been put in my name, to prevent
him from re-creating.  If he duplicated money once, it is a good bet he has
done it in the past.  As such, how many of his rooms are legitimate?

Regarding Raze, in addition to what was mentioned on the previous penalty,
the money that was in his bank account has been taken away.  He has 1 silver
and 1 gold on deposit.  The other remaining 60k gold and 218k silver has been
confiscated.  The log clearly shows him giving the money to Kerberos.
The MUD soon crashed, Kerberos logs on, deposits the money in his account, 
however Raze continued to be in possession of the very same amount.

Both Lame and Kantrax filed complaints against the other today. Kantrax

Lame accuses Kantrax of affecting him with Falmentyne's Fury, and thereby
increasing his armor class. Kantrax admitted to Falk'ing Lame, but said it was 
retaliation for the Change Sex and Summoning. Lame admitted to both the 
Change Sex and Summoning. He said the Summoning was upon request, and that
the Change Sex was in retaliation for the Falkentyne's Fury. There was no log
of any of these events, but Heaven comfirmed that they happened, if not the order in which they did.
I spoke to both Kantrax and Lame, telling them that their actions were illegal,
and not to happen again upon pain of jailing. Kantrax agreed not to sing any
song at a player, beneficial or otherwise, without consent. Lame became rather
abusive, then went AFK.
I have not imposed any penalty upon either aside from my warning, as I was

Shagath had previously engaged in this activity with his alt Skullmaster,

These two were caught multiing, no less than 5 minutes after being warned once
by me, Miju waited till i left - then logged Nighty on (which he don't even own)
and proceeded to summon Miju to Thesden... Due to him being warned already no more
than 5 minutes ago, i have decided to make this penalty a month long for both characters.
They are to be unfrozen, no sooner than March 6. 2001

And then Miju has some explaining to do to the original owner of Nighty.

Entangler has logged on others alts.  On July 1st, i heard him talking in clan channel

allowed.  Tonight, he was on as Juliette.  He claims Juliette belongs to him,
but no note was posted to that effect.  When one member of their levelling party
needed a summon, Juliette said she was going to log on Lamoreaux (entangler alt)
and I suggested calling him so he could log on and thereby avoid multiplay.
Juliette said she was on the phone with him.  Little did i know that they were
the same player and he was lying to me.  After the quad was finished, I took away
all the levels Juliette gained during quad, and jailed her for 960 ticks
which is 24 hours realtime.  When Entangler demanded an explanation, I told
him I was through with warnings and I reminded him he had received numerous warnings.
I announced that since he obviously didn't take me seriously, next time i would start

Eating that too. Kosmo's eq was seized on accident. Should he ask for it, it is rightfully his, and should be returned. 
Lauras however, has been abusing mp rules for quite a while now, and I personally feel he's getting what he deserves, perhaps too little.
Please do not reward Lauars with new eq or sympathy. We need everyone's support, he's completely balistic.
Thank you,

Subject Entangler/Backstabber Multiplay~
Text
In response to the allegations of multiplay in the form of clan war fixing, I
read the note that Rild left and then discussed the matter with another
immortal who witnessed the entire event.  After asking Entangler about the
details of what happened, he professed his innocence.  I was not convinced by
his explanation of what happened and I determined that logging on Backstabber
in order to be killed multiple times in succession for the purpose of affecting
the outcome of a clan war was multiplay.  As a result, I jailed Backstabber for
500 ticks and confiscated his inventory.
``
Greenwood was winning the clan war against Quicksand.  Entangler (clan
Quicksand) logged on an alt Backstabber (clan Greenwood) and allowed himself
to be killed four times by a fellow Quicksand clanmate.  This action allowed
clan Quicksand to gain a lead in the clan war against Greenwood.  This was
multiplay because it was an action taken by Backstabber to affect an event
that directly benefitted Entangler.  Iverath talked me out of deleting
Backstabber altogether, but next time either of them pulls a stunt like this,
at least one of the alts will be deleted.

Subject Entangler's Indirect PK of Phantos~
Text
--> Current time: 20:45:34>> Phantos has become wanted.
--> Current time: 20:45:34>> Entangler got toasted by Phantos at Devon Square Center [room XXXX]
[PK] Entangler is now protected by the No Multikill God, and thus deemed not killable.
--> Current time: 20:46:10>> Entangler got toasted by A veteran guard at Pine Street [room XXXX]
[OOC] Entangler: '(c)  I cant push mobs to do da work 4 me now?'
--> Current time: 20:52:40>> Phantos got toasted by A veteran guard at Devon Square Center [room XXXX]
``
From what I gathered, Phantos killed Entangler in DSC, which caused Phantos
to become wanted.  Entangler died again a short time later to a veteran
guard when Entangler tried to push the guard but failed and the guard
attacked.  Phantos remained wanted in Thesden and Entangler then pushed
several veteran guards into the room with Phantos.  The guards attacked
Phantos right away and a battle ensued with Phantos not attempting to flee.
Eventually, the guards killed Phantos.  All of this happened while Entangler
was under the shield of multikill protection.  Phantos complained that when
Entangler pushed the guards into the room with him, it constituted indirect
PK because Phantos' wanted status made the guards aggressive to him.  In
effect, Phantos claimed Entangler pushed several aggressive mobs into the
room with Phantos.
``
'Help Indirect PK' does not address this issue specifically, but says the
following:  "In all cases, it is illegal to indirectly kill a player
character by means of any non-combat round action."  "Some examples of
this [Illegal PK] are... teleporting a player character to an aggressive
area."  In this case, the aggressive veteran guard was brought to Phantos.
I will be clarifying this rule in 'Help Indirect PK' shortly but even so,
it is a well-known and understood rule that you may not push an aggressive
mob into a room with the intention of causing that mob to attack a player.
``
Entangler's defense was to say that since Phantos never even attempted to
escape, Phantos became responsible for his own death by his lack of
action.  Whether Phantos could have escaped from three hunting guards is
not only hypothetical but also irrelevent.  By the same token, we could
also hypothesize that Phantos might flee, only to have Entangler push the
guards into the next room and start the whole process over.  I am freezing
Entangler for one week starting today (November 15th) for Indirect PK.

After I set the freeze on Backstabber, he logged on Draconian, and began bashing me on ooc..
claiming immortal abuse, and stating "I wish there were a real Immortal on".. calling me a moron,
etc. Now I know that I was more than fair with the handling of his previous case, as indirect killing
of a noclan is a very serious offense, and 3 days freeze is nothing for it. He felt that becuase
he had provocation that he should not be punished. I made my decision and set the penalty.

He believes that I was acting impartially becuase of his Backstabber looting Phantos earlier,
however, it was not for that reason at all that I set the freeze or the nochannel. After he had logged on
another alt, continued his bashing, I nochanneled that alt, then he brought on another, which I nochanneled
before he could continue. I sent him a tell indicating that I would restore all 3 characters
channels once he was willing to agree to stop bashing me on public channels. He threatened me,
stating that he was going to 'make me lose my imm position'.. that I was blatantly abusing him,
etc etc. I repeated that he could have his channels back once he was done bashing me. He ordered
me to give him back his channels.. I repeated my request.. he abused me some on tell, then logged on
another alt, Soulfire, who did some light bashing, but not enough to warrant another nochan.
It appeared he was winding down, so I let him go, and he shut up after that. He never asked me
to restore the channels of his characters, and he logged out sometime after.

Next time he is on, please restore all 3 of his char's channels.

I'm sure by now that at very least Minax has the log of the whole event.

Subject Revaer and Entangler Deleted~
Text
For the last few days, we have had imminent crashes as I struggled to isolate
the cause of them.  During this time, Iverath happened to notice Entangler
passing around a rune, a token, and money.  As Iverath monitored over the
course of the next three or four crashes, He noticed that Entangler and
Revaer were steadily accumulating money, tokens, and runes.  Iverath
continued to watch this unfold as i systematically rooted out the cause of
the crashes.  At once point Iverath caught Entangler telling Revaer to get on
MSN instant messenger, which happened right before Revaer got involved in the
duplication scheme.  I finally found the cause, fixed it, and that's when
Iverath confronted Revaer and Entangler.  We decided the best punishment for
abusing "the oldest trick in the book" was to delete both characters, which
I did.  Revaer became beligerent and deleted the rest of his alts and
Entangler remade so as to save his name.  I'm satisfied with this and feel
no further punishment is needed.

Text
DrDoom initiated PK actions with Quest in his title after the quest was determined to be no-pk.
as there was no direct death as a result of the PK, his punishment was being pulled from the quest.

Astro (the -Victim-) was at DSC, and was not questing, when he attacked David.. DrDoom retaliated while under 'quest' status.
Astro died in combat from starvation, and tried to claim indirect.. however if you go huntin pk
while starving, it's NOT indirect. So... That's that.

Astro wanted Drdoom frozen and I'm sure he'll be appealing

Text
I noticed Aranel repeatedly dying to himself at the altar.
I snooped him a bit, and watched him demonfire himself to death on cue.  I sent a simple
tell asking him what he was doing.  No response, so 10 minutes later I went to the jail cell,
poked him, asked for a response again, and nothing for another 10 minutes.  Whatever his reason,
(most likely trying to generate runes, which can't be done anymore from player corpses), it
is clearly AFK botting, so I jailed him for the maximum time, which may not do much to jail
a botter for botting, since he will probably sit in jail for several hours before he even comes
back to the computer.  But at least the spamming of him dying will be off wiznet.

This has been a long time coming, and he has been multiplaying for some time now, feeling that his excuse of playing

Boltman approached me today about getting his character "fixed."  He claims
that Iverath lowered his levels, worsened his skills, took away good gear,
took away 200k+ gold and 100k+ silver and purged a number of Boltman's rooms.
``
Yes, he said all of those things.  I do recall Iverath bitching about how
"Boltman did it again" a couple of weeks ago, but I never got the details.
Does anyone else have any extra information to add to this?
``
I know for a fact that Boltman has been busted twice in the past for abusing
money-making mistakes in the game.  One of them was a bug and one of them was
poor planning on an imm's part.  Because of this, I am inclined to think that
Iverath had a good reason for doing what he did.  On top of all of this, it
would take hours to reimburse all the things Boltman complained about and I
don't suggest anyone do this unless the truth comes out and completely
liberates Boltman.  I also do not expect this to happen.
``
I'm posting this as a penalty since Iverath did not.  If Boltman approaches
any of you regarding this, I would encourage you not to reimburse him for
anything.

Text
We had been observing Safiyre and Rennik most of the evening after Safiyre
began deleting alts and passing all the gear to Rennik.
Eventually some of those items made their way back to Safiyre.
We rolled Safiyre back to her death file from 1 day ago and jailed her for
2900 ticks (roughly 2 days).
She admitted to getting items back from Rennik but outright lied about almost
everything else... including getting a powerful quest game item out of a quest
area by teleporting.  She claimed she got it from Rennik originally - even though
she had earlier informed Rennik of the true method.
I have removed Rennik's store where some items were stocked for the time
being, and will most likely give him 2900 ticks as well.  I'm pretty sure 
we have a good idea what items he stocked anyways.
