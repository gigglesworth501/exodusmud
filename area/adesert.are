Within the Ividian Wetforest~
Large, waxlike leaves that drooped low with clinging perspiration snap,
almost springlike, back to their original position as you brush by them.
The constant drip of water from the canopy adds an infrequent note to
the cacophony of sounds and voices that ring out periodically.  The pungent
odor of broken plantlife hangs heavy in the humid air, clinging to your
clothes and armor as you pass.

Within the Ividian Wetforest~
Exotic flora forms a virtual wall around you as you make your way carefully
through the thick tangle of vinery and plants.  Creatures of all types 
scatter through the tropical evergreens as you stumble through the thick
congealing organic barriers.  Looking around, you are greeted with curios
of all sorts, ranging from brightly-colored birds to strange little  
amphibians that fade into their backdrop.

Upon the savage desert~
No shadows manage to escape the relentless sun, only the blazing
glare of light reflected off countless grains reaches the eye. Intense 
waves of heat rise from below, distorting and blurring the sloping hills 
and rolling valleys of shifting sand. The ground itself is constantly in 
motion, footsteps falling on unstable ground, a tiny avalanche sliding 
away with each, light breezes carrying fine sheets of sand across the 
dunes - only the occasional cactus or desert flower holds steady in the 
constant motion.

Upon the savage desert~
The desert sands surround you, desolate and burning with light and heat. 
A few cacti manage to cling to life and grow here, producing large fleshy 
orange blossoms amidst the long spines. Some small birds perch atop the
cacti, looking about for insects to provide them with food. Off in the 
distance, through waves of heat, you can almost make out a clump of trees 
surrounding an oasis.

Upon the savage desert~
Trudging steadily through this desiccated wasteland of sand, you turn to     
look around for any avenue of escape and find none.  Wizened cacti           
provide a brief prophetic glimpse of exactly what your further journeying    
into this desert will be like.  Arid winds remove moisture from your         
face as you turn to face the remaining expanses of parched land.

Entangled within a thick jungle~
Tropical vegetation surrounds you closely in every direction, evoking
slight, but previously dormant feelings of claustrophobia.  Huge, majestic    
snakes curl down tree branches overhead and prepare to snap at their prey,    
possibly you.  In an attempt to nimbly avoid them, you find yourself          
struggling to free your feet from a morass of sand and vine growth that       
wrap around your feet.

Entangled within a thick jungle~
Reclusive predators snarl quietly from behind the cloak of tropical shadows
that cover this area as you pass them.  The wailing cry of a downed animal    
quickly draws their attention elsewhere, leaving you to face this tangle      
of plants without having to deal with their intervention.  Fernlike leaves    
spiral downward to interlock with vines that seem to tie onto roots and       
fallen tree branches, making it quite a task to move anywhere.

Entangled within a thick jungle~
Strange splintered cries of jungle predators cause you to move with an almost
intense trepidation, throwing yourself against the near-impenetrable barrier  
of thick-leafed plants that block your way.  Hardened and exposed tree roots  
act as anchors to ground and sky vines, forming a three dimensional net that  
takes several skillful attempts to bypass.  Leaning against a spongy tree,    
you take a moment's rest from the torturous exercise of movement before       
continuing your journey.

A Triangular Sandbar~
Currents wash over jagged red rocks and through loose piles of sand, sifting
the briny water and sending it to the river beyond.  Piles of pumice and
sandstone act as natural sluices, catching and holding salt until animals
come to lick it away.  Far off in the distance you can see waves crashing
against the remote shoals of this continent, far out on a shallow plateau
of sand.

Along a desolate stretch of beach~
A spray of water lightly coats your face as large ocean waves tower
upwards and come crashing down on the surface of the beach, sending turtles
and crabs plodding away for cover.  Beach grass and sea plants tangle
messily at the water's edge, forming a small organic reef that reaches into
the blue-green fluid, housing several colorful fish and animals.  Walking
along, you notice a strange feeling of displacement as the sea winds cool
you on one side and the beating sun heats you on the other.

Trudging steadily through this desiccated wasteland of sand, you turn to     
look around for any avenue of escape and find none.  Wizened cacti           
provide a brief prophetic glimpse of exactly what your further journeying    
into this desert will be like.  Arid winds remove moisture from your         
face as you turn to face the remaining expanses of parched land.

Upon the savage desert~
No shadows manage to escape the relentless sun, only the blazing
glare of light reflected off countless grains reaches the eye. Intense 
waves of heat rise from below, distorting and blurring the sloping hills 
and rolling valleys of shifting sand. The ground itself is constantly in 
motion, footsteps falling on unstable ground, a tiny avalanche sliding 
away with each, light breezes carrying fine sheets of sand across the 
dunes - only the occasional cactus or desert flower holds steady in the 
constant motion.

Every tree, every plant, and every blade of grass seems to bend with strain
as the humid air continually deposits moisture on their surfaces.  Walking
by, you are greeted with an almost continuous sprinkle of water as you
trigger the release of strands of water by simply touching them.  Birds
chirp short arias and sonatas in synch, filling the air with a distorted
musical harmony.

Immersed in the river Ividu~
Luxuriously silky water spins into mad little whirlpools of warm water that
die off almost as soon as they generate.  Clouds of powderlike sediment
billow underwater, changing the strange bluish fluid into a bleeding brown
and blue mess.  As you make your way along you notice birds standing at
riverside ducking their large needlebeaks into the water and coming out
with small, oval-shaped toothed fish.

Immersed in the river Ividu~
Water sloshes slowly onto the shores, which are cracked from the drastically
fast amphibious changes that result from the sun's torture and the water's
closeness.  As you cross the soft riverbed, shadows of strange fish and
other animals dart quickly out of your way, giving you a clear path to pass
through their territory.

Within the Ividian Wetforest~
Large, waxlike leaves that drooped low with clinging perspiration snap,
almost springlike, back to their original position as you brush by them.
The constant drip of water from the canopy adds an infrequent note to
the cacophony of sounds and voices that ring out periodically.  The pungent
odor of broken plantlife hangs heavy in the humid air, clinging to your
clothes and armor as you pass.

A torrid blast of wind sends your dust-covered face into a parched fever as
you walk directly into the rear of a small, concentrated sandstorm.       
Clearing your face and sidling away from the swirl, you glimpse a view       
of the flat landscape for miles in every direction.  Streams of heat         
waver up from the ground, distorting your immediate vision and invoking      
immediate frantic perspiration whenever you walk through them.

Disturbing lifeless shifts of disintegrating dunes give this region          
an aberrant feel of unnatural life.  Whirls of sand stirred into motion      
by searing eastern winds spin about and then die, lending their potential    
energy to spawn other small sand spirals in a seemingly neverending process. 
As you lift your legs slowly and carefully, plodding through the sift,       
you notice small desert creatures following and eyeing you carefully,        
as if merely waiting for your inevitable demise.

Upon the savage desert~
Shafts of sunlight distort and disperse as they sift through the net of      
liquid-like walls of heat, to fall and heat the now-still sands that litter  
this seemingly endless desert.  This stillness is soon disturbed as          
sweltering gusts of wind exacerbate the climate, making swift travel         
difficult and uncomfortable.  As you make your way through this forsaken     
pit of desolation, you notice small sparkles off in the distance, perhaps    
hinting of some end to this barrenness.

Along a desolate stretch of beach~
A pebbly shore smooths into a flat stretch of fine golden sand that
extends as far as the eye can see.  Arcs of water propel themselves onto the
coast, grasping it for a brief second before being dragged back into their
mother sea.  Spikelets of erect crowded clusters of grass grow close to the
water, soaking up leftover moisture from the tide.  As you slide along,
leaving scattered foot trails, you notice a strange abundance of seaside
life manuvering around, the only semblance of thriving nature for miles.

The desert sands surround you, desolate and burning with light and heat. 
A few cacti manage to cling to life and grow here, producing large fleshy 
orange blossoms amidst the long spines. Some small birds perch atop the
cacti, looking about for insects to provide them with food. Off in the 
distance, through waves of heat, you can almost make out a clump of trees 
surrounding an oasis.

The heat from the sun is oppressive, leaving your skin feeling dry and about

breeze provides no comfort, only blowing sand grains through the air, forcing 
you to squint at the dunes and cloudless sky stretching off into the distance.

The warm riverbed sandwiches the cold flow of inlet water between itself and
the heated overcurrent that the sweltering overhead sun creates.  As a result
of this overlap of water temperatures, the water here swirls madly, mixing
into a warm, then cold brew that tugs you down the soft path of this narrow
stream.

Upon the savage desert~
Trudging steadily through this desiccated wasteland of sand, you turn to     
look around for any avenue of escape and find none.  Wizened cacti           
provide a brief prophetic glimpse of exactly what your further journeying    
into this desert will be like.  Arid winds remove moisture from your         
face as you turn to face the remaining expanses of parched land.

Along a desolate stretch of beach~
Red stones blend in with coarse yellow sand at the water's edge, and then
fade into smooth underwater layers of the grainy stuff, spreading out
endlessly into the ocean beyond.  Overhead, the sun beats down on the
moisture-soaked sand, baking it into a strange slosh-sift mess near the
ocean border.  Strips of torn kelp and moss wash onto the shore from time to
time, littering the coast temporarily until the strong waves wash up to
reclaim them.  As you walk about, the cries of seabirds, startled at the
sight of sentient life, draw your attention upwards to the cloudless blue
sky.

Upon the savage desert~
A torrid blast of wind sends your dust-covered face into a parched fever as
you walk directly into the rear of a small, concentrated sandstorm.       
Clearing your face and sidling away from the swirl, you glimpse a view       
of the flat landscape for miles in every direction.  Streams of heat         
waver up from the ground, distorting your immediate vision and invoking      
immediate frantic perspiration whenever you walk through them.

Within the Ividian Wetforest~
Large, waxlike leaves that drooped low with clinging perspiration snap,
almost springlike, back to their original position as you brush by them.
The constant drip of water from the canopy adds an infrequent note to
the cacophony of sounds and voices that ring out periodically.  The pungent
odor of broken plantlife hangs heavy in the humid air, clinging to your
clothes and armor as you pass.

Every tree, every plant, and every blade of grass seems to bend with strain
as the humid air continually deposits moisture on their surfaces.  Walking

chirp short arias and sonatas in synch, filling the air with a distorted
musical harmony.

Immersed in the river Ividu~
Large sandstone deposits at the bottom of this narrow river strip act as
small coves for hordes of vicious wetland river animals.  Tiny stirrings
of sand mark the darting of some small predator fish to his prey, and
a tiny cloud of blood rising to the surface a few feet away confirm his
skill as a river hunter.  Above, birds circle nervously, looking for
a safe meal in the stream below.

Immersed in the river Ividu~
The warm riverbed sandwiches the cold flow of inlet water between itself and
the heated overcurrent that the sweltering overhead sun creates.  As a result
of this overlap of water temperatures, the water here swirls madly, mixing
into a warm, then cold brew that tugs you down the soft path of this narrow
stream.

Upon the savage desert~
The desert sands surround you, desolate and burning with light and heat. 
A few cacti manage to cling to life and grow here, producing large fleshy 
orange blossoms amidst the long spines. Some small birds perch atop the
cacti, looking about for insects to provide them with food. Off in the 
distance, through waves of heat, you can almost make out a clump of trees 
surrounding an oasis.

Upon the savage desert~
Shafts of sunlight distort and disperse as they sift through the net of      
liquid-like walls of heat, to fall and heat the now-still sands that litter  
this seemingly endless desert.  This stillness is soon disturbed as          
sweltering gusts of wind exacerbate the climate, making swift travel         
difficult and uncomfortable.  As you make your way through this forsaken     
pit of desolation, you notice small sparkles off in the distance, perhaps    
hinting of some end to this barrenness.

Along a desolate stretch of beach~
A pebbly shore smooths into a flat stretch of fine golden sand that
extends as far as the eye can see.  Arcs of water propel themselves onto the
coast, grasping it for a brief second before being dragged back into their
mother sea.  Spikelets of erect crowded clusters of grass grow close to the
water, soaking up leftover moisture from the tide.  As you slide along,
leaving scattered foot trails, you notice a strange abundance of seaside
life manuvering around, the only semblance of thriving nature for miles.

Upon the savage desert~
Disturbing lifeless shifts of disintegrating dunes give this region          
an aberrant feel of unnatural life.  Whirls of sand stirred into motion      
by searing eastern winds spin about and then die, lending their potential    
energy to spawn other small sand spirals in a seemingly neverending process. 
As you lift your legs slowly and carefully, plodding through the sift,       
you notice small desert creatures following and eyeing you carefully,        
as if merely waiting for your inevitable demise.

Immersed in the river Ividu~
Luxuriously silky water spins into mad little whirlpools of warm water that
die off almost as soon as they generate.  Clouds of powderlike sediment
billow underwater, changing the strange bluish fluid into a bleeding brown
and blue mess.  As you make your way along you notice birds standing at
riverside ducking their large needlebeaks into the water and coming out
with small, oval-shaped toothed fish.

Upon the savage desert~
No shadows manage to escape the relentless sun, only the blazing
glare of light reflected off countless grains reaches the eye. Intense 
waves of heat rise from below, distorting and blurring the sloping hills 
and rolling valleys of shifting sand. The ground itself is constantly in 
motion, footsteps falling on unstable ground, a tiny avalanche sliding 
away with each, light breezes carrying fine sheets of sand across the 
dunes - only the occasional cactus or desert flower holds steady in the 
constant motion.

The heat from the sun is oppressive, leaving your skin feeling dry and about 
to crack, your mouth parched with the taste of only dust and sand.  The slight
breeze provides no comfort, only blowing sand grains through the air, forcing 
you to squint at the dunes and cloudless sky stretching off into the distance.

Along a desolate stretch of beach~
A spray of water lightly coats your face as large ocean waves tower
upwards and come crashing down on the surface of the beach, sending turtles
and crabs plodding away for cover.  Beach grass and sea plants tangle
messily at the water's edge, forming a small organic reef that reaches into
the blue-green fluid, housing several colorful fish and animals.  Walking
along, you notice a strange feeling of displacement as the sea winds cool
you on one side and the beating sun heats you on the other.

Upon the savage desert~
Shafts of sunlight distort and disperse as they sift through the net of      
liquid-like walls of heat, to fall and heat the now-still sands that litter  
this seemingly endless desert.  This stillness is soon disturbed as          
sweltering gusts of wind exacerbate the climate, making swift travel         
difficult and uncomfortable.  As you make your way through this forsaken     
pit of desolation, you notice small sparkles off in the distance, perhaps    
hinting of some end to this barrenness.

Upon the savage desert~
The desert sands surround you, desolate and burning with light and heat. 
A few cacti manage to cling to life and grow here, producing large fleshy 
orange blossoms amidst the long spines. Some small birds perch atop the
cacti, looking about for insects to provide them with food. Off in the 
distance, through waves of heat, you can almost make out a clump of trees 
surrounding an oasis.

Within the Ividian Wetforest~
Exotic flora forms a virtual wall around you as you make your way carefully
through the thick tangle of vinery and plants.  Creatures of all types 
scatter through the tropical evergreens as you stumble through the thick
congealing organic barriers.  Looking around, you are greeted with curios
of all sorts, ranging from brightly-colored birds to strange little  
amphibians that fade into their backdrop.

Every tree, every plant, and every blade of grass seems to bend with strain
as the humid air continually deposits moisture on their surfaces.  Walking
by, you are greeted with an almost continuous sprinkle of water as you
trigger the release of strands of water by simply touching them.  Birds
chirp short arias and sonatas in synch, filling the air with a distorted
musical harmony.

Immersed in the river Ividu~
The warm riverbed sandwiches the cold flow of inlet water between itself and
the heated overcurrent that the sweltering overhead sun creates.  As a result
of this overlap of water temperatures, the water here swirls madly, mixing
into a warm, then cold brew that tugs you down the soft path of this narrow
stream.

A torrid blast of wind sends your dust-covered face into a parched fever as
you walk directly into the rear of a small, concentrated sandstorm.       
Clearing your face and sidling away from the swirl, you glimpse a view

waver up from the ground, distorting your immediate vision and invoking      
immediate frantic perspiration whenever you walk through them.

Entangled within a thick jungle~
Reclusive predators snarl quietly from behind the cloak of tropical shadows
that cover this area as you pass them.  The wailing cry of a downed animal 
quickly draws their attention elsewhere, leaving you to face this tangle
of plants without having to deal with their intervention.  Fernlike leaves 
spiral downward to interlock with vines that seem to tie onto roots and 
fallen tree branches, making it quite a task to move anywhere.

Along a desolate stretch of beach~
A pebbly shore smooths into a flat stretch of fine golden sand that
extends as far as the eye can see.  Arcs of water propel themselves onto the
coast, grasping it for a brief second before being dragged back into their
mother sea.  Spikelets of erect crowded clusters of grass grow close to the
water, soaking up leftover moisture from the tide.  As you slide along,
leaving scattered foot trails, you notice a strange abundance of seaside
life manuvering around, the only semblance of thriving nature for miles.

Large, waxlike leaves that drooped low with clinging perspiration snap,
almost springlike, back to their original position as you brush by them.
The constant drip of water from the canopy adds an infrequent note to
the cacophony of sounds and voices that ring out periodically.  The pungent
odor of broken plantlife hangs heavy in the humid air, clinging to your
clothes and armor as you pass.

Water sloshes slowly onto the shores, which are cracked from the drastically

other animals dart quickly out of your way, giving you a clear path to pass

light reflected off countless grains reaches the eye.  Intense waves of heat
rise from below, distorting and blurring the sloping hills and rolling
valleys of shifting sand.  The ground itself is constantly in motion,
footsteps falling on unstable ground, a tiny avalanche sliding away with
each, light breezes carrying fine sheets of sand across the dunes - only the
occasional cactus or desert flower holds steady in the constant motion.

Upon the savage desert~
The heat from the sun is oppressive, leaving your skin feeling dry and about 
to crack, your mouth parched with the taste of only dust and sand.  The slight
breeze provides no comfort, only blowing sand grains through the air, forcing 
you to squint at the dunes and cloudless sky stretching off into the distance.

The desert sands surround you, desolate and burning with light and heat. 
A few cacti manage to cling to life and grow here, producing large fleshy 
orange blossoms amidst the long spines. Some small birds perch atop the
cacti, looking about for insects to provide them with food. Off in the 
distance, through waves of heat, you can almost make out a clump of trees 
surrounding an oasis.

A torrid blast of wind sends your dust-covered face into a parched fever as
you walk directly into the rear of a small, concentrated sandstorm.       
Clearing your face and sidling away from the swirl, you glimpse a view       
of the flat landscape for miles in every direction.  Streams of heat         
waver up from the ground, distorting your immediate vision and invoking      
immediate frantic perspiration whenever you walk through them.

of all sorts, ranging from brightly-colored birds to strange little  
amphibians that fade into their backdrop.

Trees of all kinds wall in the foreboding jungle here, rimmed by an outer
layer of reddish sand and rock formations that jut into the sea.  Water
washes up along the rocks and occasionally through the closer trees, soaking
the area with the briny smell of the ocean.  Blue crayfish make their way
down the shore to the water's edge as you approach, leaving small trails
in the sand.

Sparkling dark blue water rushes in from the Ividu river here, over piles
of sand and varied rocks, before sliding out into the ocean beyond.  White
piles of foam gather at the water's edge, where the near-freshwater meets
the salty ocean and hemmorhages, bleeding white blood.  River fish slam
their tails madly in an attempt to leave this place and nestle back into
the soft currents of the Ividu, before being dragged out into the sea.

Upon the savage desert~
Disturbing lifeless shifts of disintegrating dunes give this region an
aberrant feel of unnatural life.  Whirls of sand stirred into motion by
searing eastern winds spin about and then die, lending their potential
energy to spawn other small sand spirals in a seemingly neverending process.
As you lift your legs slowly and carefully, plodding through the sift, you
notice small desert creatures following and eyeing you carefully, as if
merely waiting for your inevitable demise.

Shafts of sunlight distort and disperse as they sift through the net of      
liquid-like walls of heat, to fall and heat the now-still sands that litter  
this seemingly endless desert.  This stillness is soon disturbed as          
sweltering gusts of wind exacerbate the climate, making swift travel         
difficult and uncomfortable.  As you make your way through this forsaken     
pit of desolation, you notice small sparkles off in the distance, perhaps    
hinting of some end to this barrenness.

Large, waxlike leaves that drooped low with clinging perspiration snap,
almost springlike, back to their original position as you brush by them.
The constant drip of water from the canopy adds an infrequent note to
the cacophony of sounds and voices that ring out periodically.  The pungent
odor of broken plantlife hangs heavy in the humid air, clinging to your
clothes and armor as you pass.

Water sloshes slowly onto the shores, which are cracked from the drastically

other animals dart quickly out of your way, giving you a clear path to pass

Clusters of olive-green trees mark this area and lend their name to it,
acting as signals for those who would consider landing in this dangerous
place.  Large red rocks stand midway along the tide points, halfway
immersed after the sun sets and protruding from the sand in the daytime.
As you scan along this land you notice an abundance of fur-covered creatures
that scamper up trees and cackle down at you with an odd semblance of
pseudointelligence.

cacti, looking about for insects to provide them with food. Off in the 
distance, through waves of heat, you can almost make out a clump of trees 
surrounding an oasis.

Upon the savage desert~
No shadows manage to escape the relentless sun, only the blazing
glare of light reflected off countless grains reaches the eye. Intense 
waves of heat rise from below, distorting and blurring the sloping hills 
and rolling valleys of shifting sand. The ground itself is constantly in 
motion, footsteps falling on unstable ground, a tiny avalanche sliding 
away with each, light breezes carrying fine sheets of sand across the 
dunes - only the occasional cactus or desert flower holds steady in the 
constant motion.

Upon the savage desert~
A torrid blast of wind sends your dust-covered face into a parched fever as
you walk directly into the rear of a small, concentrated sandstorm.       
Clearing your face and sidling away from the swirl, you glimpse a view       
of the flat landscape for miles in every direction.  Streams of heat         
waver up from the ground, distorting your immediate vision and invoking      
immediate frantic perspiration whenever you walk through them.

Within the Ividian Wetforest~
Large, waxlike leaves that drooped low with clinging perspiration snap,
almost springlike, back to their original position as you brush by them.
The constant drip of water from the canopy adds an infrequent note to
the cacophony of sounds and voices that ring out periodically.  The pungent
odor of broken plantlife hangs heavy in the humid air, clinging to your
clothes and armor as you pass.

Immersed in the river Ividu~
Luxuriously silky water spins into mad little whirlpools of warm water that
die off almost as soon as they generate.  Clouds of powderlike sediment
billow underwater, changing the strange bluish fluid into a bleeding brown
and blue mess.  As you make your way along you notice birds standing at
riverside ducking their large needlebeaks into the water and coming out
with small, oval-shaped toothed fish.

Immersed in the river Ividu~
Large sandstone deposits at the bottom of this narrow river strip act as
small coves for hordes of vicious wetland river animals.  Tiny stirrings
of sand mark the darting of some small predator fish to his prey, and
a tiny cloud of blood rising to the surface a few feet away confirm his
skill as a river hunter.  Above, birds circle nervously, looking for
a safe meal in the stream below.

Exotic birds chirp strange songs from above as you wander beneath their
roosts.  Shade from the tall trees is only a slight relief from the
humidity that this area boasts, a boon to the growth of odd and mysterious
life.  As you walk through you notice several colorful plants of kinds
you cannot place.

The verdant coast~
Sharp, piercing pebbles make it necessary to watch your step as you tread
across this weedy land.  Triangular trees spiral upwards to form drooping
canopies of shade, where small furred desert rats and crabs search for food
underneath.  The saline smell of the air acts as a testament to the relative
nearness of the ocean, which you can hear as clearly as if it were right in
front of you.

The edge of the vast desert~
Shafts of sunlight distort and disperse as they sift through the net of
liquid-like walls of heat, to fall and heat the now-still sands that litter
this seemingly endless desert.  This stillness is soon disturbed as
sweltering gusts of wind exacerbate the climate, making swift travel
difficult and uncomfortable.  As you make your way through this forsaken pit
of desolation, you notice small sparkles off in the distance, perhaps
hinting of some end to this barrenness.

The heat from the sun is oppressive, leaving your skin feeling dry and about 
to crack, your mouth parched with the taste of only dust and sand.  The slight
breeze provides no comfort, only blowing sand grains through the air, forcing 
you to squint at the dunes and cloudless sky stretching off into the distance.

At the head of the river Ividu~
A large swirl of water flows slowly in a spiral, curving outwards to the
south to blend into a slightly raised riverbed.  Plants hug the shore,
growing either right at the water's edge or actually in the water, to
compensate for the anhydrous climate.

The verdant coast~
Tall weeds grow out of the disarray of sand and grass here, and border
small trees bearing coconuts and palm leaves.  The sounds of exotic birds
and animals interact with the constant sound of ocean water, creating a
strange dissonance that somehow seems appropriate.  A cloudless sky acts as
a poor shield for the rays of sunlight that filter down through the leaves
to heat you uncomfortably.

Along a desolate stretch of beach~
Cooling breezes of ocean air provide a temporary relief from the
sweltering heat that pervades this area.  White-crested waves crest quickly
and extend onto the beach, causing the dark stained patch of sand to creep
slowly outwards.  Tiny bright red crabs scuttle into quickly-forged holes as
the water sweeps over the beach, and then stick out eyestalks to see exactly
how safe it is to return to their position of foraging.

Upon the savage desert~
No shadows manage to escape the relentless sun, only the blazing
glare of light reflected off countless grains reaches the eye. Intense 
waves of heat rise from below, distorting and blurring the sloping hills 
and rolling valleys of shifting sand. The ground itself is constantly in 
motion, footsteps falling on unstable ground, a tiny avalanche sliding 
away with each, light breezes carrying fine sheets of sand across the 
dunes - only the occasional cactus or desert flower holds steady in the 
constant motion.

The constant drip of water from the canopy adds an infrequent note to
the cacophony of sounds and voices that ring out periodically.  The pungent
odor of broken plantlife hangs heavy in the humid air, clinging to your
clothes and armor as you pass.

Immersed in the river Ividu~
The warm riverbed sandwiches the cold flow of inlet water between itself and
the heated overcurrent that the sweltering overhead sun creates.  As a result
of this overlap of water temperatures, the water here swirls madly, mixing
into a warm, then cold brew that tugs you down the soft path of this narrow
stream.

Every tree, every plant, and every blade of grass seems to bend with strain
as the humid air continually deposits moisture on their surfaces.  Walking

trigger the release of strands of water by simply touching them.  Birds
chirp short arias and sonatas in synch, filling the air with a distorted

Along a desolate stretch of beach~
A spray of water lightly coats your face as large ocean waves tower upwards
and come crashing down on the surface of the beach, sending turtles and
crabs plodding away for cover.  Beach grass and sea plants tangle messily
at the water's edge, forming a small organic reef that reaches into the
blue-green fluid, housing several colorful fish and animals.  Walking along,
you notice a strange feeling of displacement as the sea winds cool you on one
side and the beating sun heats you on the other.

The heat from the sun is oppressive, leaving your skin feeling dry and about

Upon the savage desert~
Shafts of sunlight distort and disperse as they sift through the net of      
liquid-like walls of heat, to fall and heat the now-still sands that litter  
this seemingly endless desert.  This stillness is soon disturbed as          
sweltering gusts of wind exacerbate the climate, making swift travel         
difficult and uncomfortable.  As you make your way through this forsaken     
pit of desolation, you notice small sparkles off in the distance, perhaps    
hinting of some end to this barrenness.

Upon the savage desert~
No shadows manage to escape the relentless sun, only the blazing
glare of light reflected off countless grains reaches the eye. Intense 
waves of heat rise from below, distorting and blurring the sloping hills 
and rolling valleys of shifting sand. The ground itself is constantly in 
motion, footsteps falling on unstable ground, a tiny avalanche sliding 
away with each, light breezes carrying fine sheets of sand across the 
dunes - only the occasional cactus or desert flower holds steady in the 
constant motion.

The Ogouzo Bay~
Crystalline clear water pulls in and out of a strange depression in the
ground, feeding into a narrow strip of land leading downhill to another
swirling pool of liquid.  Dark red crustaceans tumble into the bay pool
with every push of the tide, and rush to turn themselves over to scuttle
back out to the ocean before the next slosh of water pushes them into the
riverhead.  Vulpine, silver-furred animals stand over the side of the
inlet, dipping claws into the water periodically in futile attempts to
catch one of the influx of sea fish that swim around.

Along a desolate stretch of beach~
Cooling breezes of ocean air provide a temporary relief from the
sweltering heat that pervades this area.  White-crested waves crest quickly
and extend onto the beach, causing the dark stained patch of sand to creep
slowly outwards.  Tiny bright red crabs scuttle into quickly-forged holes as
the water sweeps over the beach, and then stick out eyestalks to see exactly
how safe it is to return to their position of foraging.

The verdant coast~
The thick trunks of segmented trees climb upward conically to meet at a
drooping pinpoint, where thick scimitar-shaped leaves offer a small
percentage of shade to any below.  Gray rocks litter the area, surrounded by
clumps of grass and thin strips of sandy ground.  Far off in the distance
you can see a strange simian creature ascending a fruit tree to harvest a
thick-skinned edible.

The Ogouzo Bay~
A small sandbar formed by the ever-moving action of the water entering the
bay traps wide, circular crabs and starfish, leaving them open to any
predator that might happen along.  Bars of sunlight stream down to hit the
clear blue water here, then refracting perpendicularly to cascade off in
wavy doppelgangers of themselves.  As you stride around the satiny edge
of the water trap, you notice recently-dug holes marring the otherwise
marble-smooth surface.  Tiny turtles snap their heads out after each rush
of water, and amble down to the bay to search for any stray fish.

Luxuriously silky water spins into mad little whirlpools of warm water that
die off almost as soon as they generate.  Clouds of powderlike sediment
billow underwater, changing the strange bluish fluid into a bleeding brown
and blue mess.  As you make your way along you notice birds standing at
riverside ducking their large needlebeaks into the water and coming out
with small, oval-shaped toothed fish.

Within the Ividian Wetforest~
Large, waxlike leaves that drooped low with clinging perspiration snap,
almost springlike, back to their original position as you brush by them.
The constant drip of water from the canopy adds an infrequent note to
the cacophony of sounds and voices that ring out periodically.  The pungent
odor of broken plantlife hangs heavy in the humid air, clinging to your
clothes and armor as you pass.

A lightly humid wetforest~
Tall deciduous trees tower over smaller exotic plants, lending their shade
in an unsuccessful attempt to cool the area.  Heat and shade soak the
atmosphere with a thick humidity that seems to encourage all forms of life
to spring forth from the damp floor.  A large purplish plant hangs high
from the trunk of a shade-tree, glowing quietly with a strange phosporic
inner light and lighting the path you walk down.

The Ogouzo Bay~
Seawater slides into a small depression in the ground, shifting sand forward
as it flows inwards, and pulling it back as the remainder goes back into
the ocean.  A slight slope carries the mass of water to a pool off in the
distance south, where it coalesces into a narrow river.  Rocks and conical
trees border the bay, offering a shady solitude to the many animals that
come here to hunt, and the animals that come to hunt them.

The Ogouzo Bay~
Crystalline clear water pulls in and out of a strange depression in the
ground, feeding into a narrow strip of land leading downhill to another
swirling pool of liquid.  Dark red crustaceans tumble into the bay pool
with every push of the tide, and rush to turn themselves over to scuttle
back out to the ocean before the next slosh of water pushes them into the
riverhead.  Vulpine, silver-furred animals stand over the side of the
inlet, dipping claws into the water periodically in futile attempts to
catch one of the influx of sea fish that swim around.

The Ogouzo Bay~
A small sandbar formed by the ever-moving action of the water entering the
bay traps wide, circular crabs and starfish, leaving them open to any
predator that might happen along.  Bars of sunlight stream down to hit the
clear blue water here, then refracting perpendicularly to cascade off in
wavy doppelgangers of themselves.  As you stride around the satiny edge
of the water trap, you notice recently-dug holes marring the otherwise
marble-smooth surface.  Tiny turtles snap their heads out after each rush
of water, and amble down to the bay to search for any stray fish.

Along a desolate stretch of beach~
A pebbly shore smooths into a flat stretch of fine golden sand that
extends as far as the eye can see.  Arcs of water propel themselves onto the
coast, grasping it for a brief second before being dragged back into their
mother sea.  Spikelets of erect crowded clusters of grass grow close to the
water, soaking up leftover moisture from the tide.  As you slide along,
leaving scattered foot trails, you notice a strange abundance of seaside
life manuvering around, the only semblance of thriving nature for miles.

Upon the savage desert~
The heat from the sun is oppressive, leaving your skin feeling dry and about 
to crack, your mouth parched with the taste of only dust and sand.  The slight
breeze provides no comfort, only blowing sand grains through the air, forcing 
you to squint at the dunes and cloudless sky stretching off into the distance.

a poor shield for the rays of sunlight that filter down through the leaves
to heat you uncomfortably.

Upon the savage desert~
Trudging steadily through this desiccated wasteland of sand, you turn to     
look around for any avenue of escape and find none.  Wizened cacti           
provide a brief prophetic glimpse of exactly what your further journeying    
into this desert will be like.  Arid winds remove moisture from your         
face as you turn to face the remaining expanses of parched land.

Upon the savage desert~
Disturbing lifeless shifts of disintegrating dunes give this region          
an aberrant feel of unnatural life.  Whirls of sand stirred into motion      
by searing eastern winds spin about and then die, lending their potential    
energy to spawn other small sand spirals in a seemingly neverending process. 
As you lift your legs slowly and carefully, plodding through the sift,       
you notice small desert creatures following and eyeing you carefully,        
as if merely waiting for your inevitable demise.

chirp short arias and sonatas in synch, filling the air with a distorted

Immersed in the river Ividu~
The warm riverbed sandwiches the cold flow of inlet water between itself and
the heated overcurrent that the sweltering overhead sun creates.  As a result
of this overlap of water temperatures, the water here swirls madly, mixing
into a warm, then cold brew that tugs you down the soft path of this narrow
stream.

The verdant coast~
Sharp, piercing pebbles make it necessary to watch your step as you tread
across this weedy land.  Triangular trees spiral upwards to form drooping
canopies of shade, where small furred desert rats and crabs search for food
underneath.  The saline smell of the air acts as a testament to the relative
nearness of the ocean, which you can hear as clearly as if it were right in
front of you.

Along a sandy shore~
Cooling breezes of ocean air provide a temporary relief from the sweltering
heat that pervades this area.  White-crested waves crest quickly and
extend onto the beach, causing the dark stained patch of sand to creep 
slowly outwards.  Tiny bright red crabs scuttle into quickly-forged holes 
as the water sweeps over the beach, and then stick out eyestalks to 
see exactly how safe it is to return to their position of foraging.

Along a sandy shore~
Red stones blend in with coarse yellow sand at the water's edge, and then
fade into smooth underwater layers of the grainy stuff, spreading out  
endlessly into the ocean beyond.  Overhead, the sun beats down on the  
moisture-soaked sand, baking it into a strange slosh-sift mess near the
ocean border.  Strips of torn kelp and moss wash onto the shore from
time to time, littering the coast temporarily until the strong waves wash 
up to reclaim them.  As you walk about, the cries of seabirds, startled
at the sight of a human, draw your attention upwards to the cloudless  
blue sky.

Upon the savage desert~
Shafts of sunlight distort and disperse as they sift through the net of      
liquid-like walls of heat, to fall and heat the now-still sands that litter  
this seemingly endless desert.  This stillness is soon disturbed as          
sweltering gusts of wind exacerbate the climate, making swift travel         
difficult and uncomfortable.  As you make your way through this forsaken     
pit of desolation, you notice small sparkles off in the distance, perhaps    
hinting of some end to this barrenness.

The desert sands surround you, desolate and burning with light and heat.
A few cacti manage to cling to life and grow here, producing large fleshy
orange blossoms amidst the long spines. Some small birds perch atop the
cacti, looking about for insects to provide them with food. Off in the
distance, through waves of heat, you can almost make out a clump of trees
surrounding an oasis.

A torrid blast of wind sends your dust-covered face into a parched fever as
you walk directly into the rear of a small, concentrated sandstorm.       
Clearing your face and sidling away from the swirl, you glimpse a view       
of the flat landscape for miles in every direction.  Streams of heat         
waver up from the ground, distorting your immediate vision and invoking      
immediate frantic perspiration whenever you walk through them.

Water sloshes slowly onto the shores, which are cracked from the drastically

other animals dart quickly out of your way, giving you a clear path to pass

Large sandstone deposits at the bottom of this narrow river strip act as
small coves for hordes of vicious wetland river animals.  Tiny stirrings
of sand mark the darting of some small predator fish to his prey, and
a tiny cloud of blood rising to the surface a few feet away confirm his
skill as a river hunter.  Above, birds circle nervously, looking for
a safe meal in the stream below.

with chipmunks and squirrels in a strange transposition of forest and
rainforest.

Entangled within a thick jungle~
Strange splintered cries of jungle predators cause you to move with an almost
intense trepidation, throwing yourself against the near-impenetrable barrier  
of thick-leafed plants that block your way.  Hardened and exposed tree roots  
act as anchors to ground and sky vines, forming a three dimensional net that  
takes several skillful attempts to bypass.  Leaning against a spongy tree, 
you take a moment's rest from the torturous exercise of movement before 
continuing your journey.

Entangled within a thick jungle~
Waves of consternation wash over you as you stumble and hit the ground hard,
only to pull your head up to see a pair of narrow yellow eyes watching you 
from the shadows.  Stepping heavily, you move through this thick mass of
confusion, hacking the tangled vines and plants away as you move.  As the  
jumble of greenery closes tightly around you, it becomes harder and harder 
to see much farther forward than you can swing with your weapon.

Along a desolate stretch of beach~
Red stones blend in with coarse yellow sand at the water's edge, and then
fade into smooth underwater layers of the grainy stuff, spreading out
endlessly into the ocean beyond.  Overhead, the sun beats down on the
moisture-soaked sand, baking it into a strange slosh-sift mess near the
ocean border.  Strips of torn kelp and moss wash onto the shore from time to
time, littering the coast temporarily until the strong waves wash up to
reclaim them.  As you walk about, the cries of seabirds, startled at the
sight of sentient life, draw your attention upwards to the cloudless blue
sky.

Upon the savage desert~
No shadows manage to escape the relentless sun, only the blazing
glare of light reflected off countless grains reaches the eye. Intense 
waves of heat rise from below, distorting and blurring the sloping hills 
and rolling valleys of shifting sand. The ground itself is constantly in 
motion, footsteps falling on unstable ground, a tiny avalanche sliding 
away with each, light breezes carrying fine sheets of sand across the 
dunes - only the occasional cactus or desert flower holds steady in the 
constant motion.

The heat from the sun is oppressive, leaving your skin feeling dry and about

you to squint at the dunes and cloudless sky stretching off into the distance.

Immersed in the river Ividu~
Large sandstone deposits at the bottom of this narrow river strip act as
small coves for hordes of vicious wetland river animals.  Tiny stirrings
of sand mark the darting of some small predator fish to his prey, and
a tiny cloud of blood rising to the surface a few feet away confirm his
skill as a river hunter.  Above, birds circle nervously, looking for
a safe meal in the stream below.

The desert sands surround you, desolate and burning with light and heat. 
A few cacti manage to cling to life and grow here, producing large fleshy 
orange blossoms amidst the long spines. Some small birds perch atop the
cacti, looking about for insects to provide them with food. Off in the 
distance, through waves of heat, you can almost make out a clump of trees 
surrounding an oasis.

At the emptying mouth of the river Ividu~
Thick seawater rushes to grab the river fluid that flows down and outwards
here to meet the ocean again and become salt-filled once more.  Hybrid
starfish and other strange creatures that live in both freshwater and
salt water gather here and live for the most part in peace, not having
to worry about predators from either realm.

Along a desolate stretch of beach~
Cooling breezes of ocean air provide a temporary relief from the
sweltering heat that pervades this area.  White-crested waves crest quickly
and extend onto the beach, causing the dark stained patch of sand to creep
slowly outwards.  Tiny bright red crabs scuttle into quickly-forged holes as
the water sweeps over the beach, and then stick out eyestalks to see exactly
how safe it is to return to their position of foraging.

of the flat landscape for miles in every direction.  Streams of heat         
waver up from the ground, distorting your immediate vision and invoking      
immediate frantic perspiration whenever you walk through them.

The warm riverbed sandwiches the cold flow of inlet water between itself and

A lightly humid wetforest~
Trudging steadily through this desiccated wasteland of sand, you turn to     
look around for any avenue of escape and find none.  Wizened cacti           
provide a brief prophetic glimpse of exactly what your further journeying    
into this desert will be like.  Arid winds remove moisture from your         
face as you turn to face the remaining expanses of parched land.             
Tall deciduous trees tower over smaller exotic plants, lending their shade
in an unsuccessful attempt to cool the area.  Heat and shade soak the
atmosphere with a thick humidity that seems to encourage all forms of life
to spring forth from the damp floor.  A large purplish plant hangs high
from the trunk of a shade-tree, glowing quietly with a strange phosporic
inner light and lighting the path you walk down.

Within the folds of a humid wetforest~
Exotic flora forms a virtual wall around you as you make your way carefully  
through the thick tangle of vinery and plants.  Creatures of all types 
scatter through the tropical evergreens as you stumble through the thick
congealing organic barriers.  Looking around, you are greeted with curios
of all sorts, ranging from brightly-colored birds to strange little
amphibians that fade into their backdrop.

Entangled within a thick jungle~
Dense clusters of greenery seem to entangle themselves into the surrounding
thicket, creating an interlocked net of motion impairment with the vines
and ferns that droop from jumbled canopy trees in the distance above.  The 
symphony of voices that bellow through the framework of the jungle is not  
in the least way comforting to you, and the howls echoing off in the distance 
set off a primeval fear deep within you.  As you cut your way through the  
almost solid wall of plantlife, the clear sap-blood of your nonaware victims  
splashes to stain your armor.

Along a desolate stretch of beach~
A spray of water lightly coats your face as large ocean waves tower
upwards and come crashing down on the surface of the beach, sending turtles
and crabs plodding away for cover.  Beach grass and sea plants tangle
messily at the water's edge, forming a small organic reef that reaches into
the blue-green fluid, housing several colorful fish and animals.  Walking
along, you notice a strange feeling of displacement as the sea winds cool
you on one side and the beating sun heats you on the other.

Upon the savage desert~
The desert sands surround you, desolate and burning with light and heat. 
A few cacti manage to cling to life and grow here, producing large fleshy 
orange blossoms amidst the long spines. Some small birds perch atop the
cacti, looking about for insects to provide them with food. Off in the 
distance, through waves of heat, you can almost make out a clump of trees 
surrounding an oasis.

Upon the savage desert~
Trudging steadily through this desiccated wasteland of sand, you turn to     
look around for any avenue of escape and find none.  Wizened cacti           
provide a brief prophetic glimpse of exactly what your further journeying    
into this desert will be like.  Arid winds remove moisture from your         
face as you turn to face the remaining expanses of parched land.

Upon the savage desert~
Disturbing lifeless shifts of disintegrating dunes give this region          
an aberrant feel of unnatural life.  Whirls of sand stirred into motion      
by searing eastern winds spin about and then die, lending their potential    
energy to spawn other small sand spirals in a seemingly neverending process. 
As you lift your legs slowly and carefully, plodding through the sift,       
you notice small desert creatures following and eyeing you carefully,        
as if merely waiting for your inevitable demise.

Within the Ividian Wetforest~
Every tree, every plant, and every blade of grass seems to bend with strain
as the humid air continually deposits moisture on their surfaces.  Walking
by, you are greeted with an almost continuous sprinkle of water as you
trigger the release of strands of water by simply touching them.  Birds
chirp short arias and sonatas in synch, filling the air with a distorted
musical harmony.

Immersed in the river Ividu~
Water sloshes slowly onto the shores, which are cracked from the drastically
fast amphibious changes that result from the sun's torture and the water's
closeness.  As you cross the soft riverbed, shadows of strange fish and
other animals dart quickly out of your way, giving you a clear path to pass
through their territory.
