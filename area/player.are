hary dummy~
Hary, the dummy,~
Hary, the dummy, tries to sell you a fake stiletto.
~
A large, menacing looking figure enshrouded in a dark, brown coat looms
over you.  Wild hair sticks out of the top of the coat, but you cannot see
this creature's face because of the dust-brown hat pulled low over it.  It
reaches for you with one long, clawed hand, and in a whispering rasp,
says...  'Could I interest you, gentle soul, in the finest in gold
stilettos?  Only twenty silver' With this announcement he yanks open his
coat to display row after row of shiny daggers...  With the gold paint
flaking off onto his coat.

loiosh~
A perching jhereg~
A medium-sized jhereg watches your every moment from his perch in the corner.
~
A jhereg is somewhat like a bird and somewhat like a lizard.  Being one
of creation's more intelligent creatures, they make the best of companions
if you can find a way to tame or successfully capture one of these dangerous
creatures.  (Both taming and capturing haven't worked yet, I'm told.)  This
jhereg, Loiosh, doesn't seem too imposing.  Every so often, he stretches his
leathery, bat-like wings as his eyes follow your movements around the room. 
Stretching only a little over a meter long from head to the tip of his long
tail, he does not weigh more than twenty or so pounds.  His needle-sharp,
poisoned claws quietly click against his perch as he watches you.  Every so
often, a long black tongue can be seen to snake out from between his sharp,
curved, parrot-like beak -- one that's also poisoned, I might add.  Not
incredibly strong or super, super fast, Loisoh makes a good friend in any
case.  His incredible smarts, reconissance ability and his poisoned claws
and beak make a great combination for a bodyguard.

Harris, the pathetic sidhe bard~
`gHarris``, the pathetic sidhe bard, sits in chains here.
~
Harris, the once less-pathetic sidhe bard, now stands here
in chains, serving only as a gate mob and for clan members
to vent their rage upon (as well as practice their skills).
He lost his wings in a fight with Oro, one of the many sidhe
who hate him with a vengeance.  Harris, quite simply put, sucks.

`cThe syvin shopkeeper, Elanor``~
`cA young woman reclines in her hammock here, waiting for guests.``
~
`dA young, almost innocent syvin stretches out lazily in a hammock strung
between the two poles of her tent.  She wears a small, `cgreen`d dress that
seems to be made of feathers and leaves, that reflect all the colors of
nature.  She gazes outside her haven with a weary look in her eyes at all
the madness, as if to say 'Outside this place, I have so little power; but
here, I am freed of the fetters on my soul and have been appointed to do
what I can'.  Her beautiful, `gc`nl`oo`gu`ld`oy `nb`ll`gu`ee`d eyes know
suffering and patience, and she has dedicated her life to sharing the beauty
of her soul with those graced enough to find her.

`hOne of Iverath's minions, the demon warrior Gazarron, stands here, serving Twilight.``
~
`bThe mythical warrior Gazarron stands before you.  Once a great human
warlord, that had laid most of the world under him.  His ruthlessness in
battle, and his bloodthirsty behavior earned him the name '`kThe Demon`b'. 
But one day he met a warrior by the name of Leiath Caligian, not only a
skilled fighter, but also known for his ungodly luck.  Stories told of him
once being blessed, or maybe cursed, by the demon lord Iverath to walk the
lands to the end of time.  Gazarron, however was never one to listen when
wise men spoke, so he challenged Leiath on the battlefield, warring against
the clan of Forsaken.  And as it no matter how good you are, there is always
someone better.  Gazarron lost, and was sacrificed on the Altar of Iverath. 
Now Gazarron, resurrected to serve clan Twilight, trains any willing
warrior, to the end of his days.  ``

``This`d Ca`kme`hl B`kug`dgy`` is a simple`k wooden`` box on wheels, pulled by a team
of the finest trained`d camels`` this side of the ocean.  It's hard to
believe that any one person could afford so many fine specimans, yet
apparently such a person does exist.  The wooden box has been painted
a shade of yellow that blends in with the sand.  From far away, it
simply looks like a mirage.  The wooden wheels have been specially
carved by a team of slave dwarves, who worked for two years to make
sure these wheels would turn properly and not get stuck in this
desert sand.

`aN`he`ov`he`ar `aE`hn`odi`hn`ag `oLove``~
The warmth that you feel radiating from this room isn't just physical heat. You
feel all the love that has been created in this room, coursing through you.  
A wave of happiness washes over you.  You also feel a small tugging in your groin
that pulls you towards the bed.  From this feeling alone, you know all the love that
was made in this room was not just emotional.  Suddenly, vivid images of a naked 
woman with pale skin and black wings on top of a pale man with black hair race 
through your head.  Catching only bits and pieces, you suddenly know where the claw
marks in the headboard came from.  And it definitely wasn't a wild animal.

Lissiana's Brewery``~
`hThe sweet smell of `br`io`bs`ie`bs`h invades your nose as you enter
this shop.  There is `ha gentle song wafting in the air, familiar, yet you
are unable to place it.  The air is slightly `hhazy from the incense burning
in the corner, and the atmosphere is calm.  There are many things `hhanging
on the walls, ranging from innocent flowers to deadly looking weapons. 
There is a cool `lb`er`le`ee`lz`ee`h blowing through the shop, rustling the
glass `nv`oi`na`ol`ns `hthat are seemingly `hsuspended in midair around the
walls.  The keeper is in, and as you enter, she looks up at you with `ha
look of surprise on her face.  She relaxes slightly when she notices you are
not her boss, `bL`iis`hsi`ian`ba``

`aA Tunnel Under the Mountain``~
`b  These tunnels do not seem to be man-, or rather dwarf-made.  Dug out of
the side of the mountain, either to mine precious metals, or to make
living quarters for the dwarven kind... except something went wrong here, very wrong...
scattered around the room are all that remains of those dwarves, bones, skulls, guts,
eyeballs, arm, legs, you name it... and the ghoul that's standing here might actually sell it.

`bIf it stayed I'd never leave it
If that turned around...
I'd grieve the special dirty things
That we used to talk about
  
I mean that loving you is strange
And adored by me throughout
Oh no, It's you again
   
Someday soon you'll find that someone
Waiting for the chance to beat you
Drooling on the set to feel you
Blessing you with every kiss
   
Tying yourself to me
Stitch up my emptiness
'Cause you're the death of me
So precious loving the thrill
     
Rolling dice, and seeming queer
Bastard love, A sick afair
Let's see what new disease you'll fetch
     
I mean that fucking you is strange
And adored by me throughout
Oh no, it's you again
Blessing you with every kiss
   
So precious you know
This hate of mine exploded
I'm so deranged you know
I will never be the same
  
Tying yourself to me
Stitch up my emptiness
'Cause you're the death of me
So precious loving the thrill

South of Hell``~
Slightly warmer than the face of the sun, this room is bathed in the molten heat of hells furnaces. Shimmering waves rise off of every surface,  
distorting your view, and destroying any perceptions of the size of the chamber you are in.  A chaise lounge sit across from you, looking
comfortable, except for the smouldering and fire.
The irony, of course, is that you went up to get in here, when quite obviously, hell is down.
Noone ever said that hell was where you thought it was.

`nThe Center Parlour``~
`gAs you enter the main hall of the fortress, you notice that the walls
and domed ceiling are not formed of any kind of masonry.  Rather, the large
witch wood trees grow very near to one another, and the thick black vines
that spiral the trunks reach out and intertwine to fill any gaps that are
formed.  High above, the trees arch together to form a high domed ceiling. 
As the they taper out, the needle-covered branches form intricate patterns
that play with the light as is shines through and splashes on the floor in
radiant colors.  The bark of the witchwood is etched with runes of an
ancient language, to the uneducated they seem more like art that writing
when compared to the crude commoners script.  Father up where the writing
fades out of your vision, large engraved pictures line the walls depicting
battles between the fair folk and large black creatures you cannot name. 
Even higher up hanging from the arched bows you see beautifully woven Syvin
`ntapestries`g that must be at least two human lengths long.  They show
peacefull scenes of grand `nwaterfalls`g and wind swept plains.  You finally
pull your attention away from the awe inspiring walls and notice that you
are standing on a large hardwood floor.  The entire floor looks to be one
single piece of wood as you see no seems or defects.  The floor is hard as
rock and your boots make a dull, heavy tapping sound is if on stone instead
of wood.  As you look closer you see a small;`netching`g marking the
otherwise undamaged floor.  ``

Eastern Prairie``~
You stand in the midst of the interminable eastern farmlands of Fierense. 
The amber sun gleams brightly on the flaxen grains of wheat, and you can 
imagine that after dusk, these fields are breathtakingly illuminated under
the reign of the mystic moon.  This land blossoms under the guidance of 
extreme climate, from the tepid humidity of summer to the liberating harvests
of autumn to the dull grey bareness of winter, and always, to the rebirth of 
spring.

Eastern Prairie``~
Giant corn and wheat stalks rise around you, some stretching above your head
towards the clear blue sky. The thick green leaves provide welcome
shade from the sun, a cool breeze blowing among them. Sporadic chirps or
a flapping of wings reveal some crows hiding among the crops, disturbed by
your presence.

`nOverlooking the Ballcourt````~
`gBall and ballplayers zoom around on the field just barely out of your
reach.  A protective net `ghas been set up, if not to protect the audience,
then for keeping the ball on the court.  `gBenches made out of white
sandstone sit warming in the tall grass, more often occupied by `gstray
monkeys and birds than actual spectators.  For some reason visitors to the
City of the Sun `gseem to enjoy killing the ballplayers more than actually
watching the game.  ``

`oLong, `awooden beams `ostretch across the rooftop of the barn. Stringy `bspider webs `ocriss-cross
down from the ceilings towards the `khayloft`o. A soft coo of a `abarn owl `odrifts down from
the `awooden beams`o and the `esky `opeeks in through cracks in the `awooden boards`o. The `khay`o has been
stacked in piles towards the ceiling, and a `klarge bale `ohas been pulled apart and is strewn 
across the floor in a messy heap, as if someone has been rolling around in it!``

`jNynaeve and Austin's Sanctuary````~
`nThis room is large and spacious with many different features to catch
the eye.  The color is a soothing green that is reminiscent of the forest
canopy.  `nThere is a large oil painting adorning one wall that shows
Nynaeve and Austin smiling at one another lovingly.  `nThe floor is carpeted
with rugs of varying shades of brown and green similar to the forest floor. 
It is obvious that even though the room was built by the mage Nynaeve she
has tried to make `nher love Austin feel as comfortable as if he were within
the forest.  `nThere are cushions spread out along the floor that are
inviting for rest and relaxation.  Along one wall is a sign that a mage
lives here.  A bookcase with vials and flasks that are labeled with thier
contents.

`aThe room is of medium size and the lighting is low.  There is a small
fireplace on the east wall to help fight off the cold in winter.  `aA few
well done paintings hang here and there is a window overlooking the prairie
in the east wall.  `aA long table is in the middle of the room already set

`iCrimson Pirate `vBooty Room``~
`hThis is the room that you have heard so much about.  This is where the
pirates keep the treasure they have looted from the thousands of people who
have had the misfortune of crossing their paths.  Everywhere you look,
things are littered in disarray.  A `bskeleton`h lies in the corner, a
reminder of the fact that unless you are one of the chosen few, you should
not be in here now.  A large `bcrate`h sits in the center of the room with a
sign over it saying `vPlace Your Booty Here!`h

An old skeleton lies hunched over in a corner with a cutlass still jabbed
through his ribcage.  He still wears his pirate hat and eyepatch, though
they only cover a skull now.  Cobwebs cover his rotten bones and the rags of
what used to be fine clothing.  He is proof of the saying that '`bDead men
tell no tales!`h'

Justice Inc.``~
`gYou have been weighed, you have been measured, and you have been found
wanting.  `` `g The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the
inequities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men.  Blessed is he, who
in the name of charity and good will, shepherds the weak through the valley
of darkness, for he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost
children.  And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious
anger those who would attempt to poison and destroy my brothers.  And you
will know my name is the Lord when I lay my vengeance upon thee.

A Cargo Hold``~
`hThis room is massive, with large `bboxes`h and `bcrates`h sitting all over the
place.  Most likely, this is the belly of a massive ship, although, you
don't feel the motion of the sea, possibly due to the size of the ship you
are on.  You see a few `bportholes`h along the wall, which let the only
outside light into the room.  The exits from this room are not immediately
visible, but if you poke around for long enough, you'll have to find them
sooner or later.  After all, you got IN here somehow.

Through the portholes you can see the endless sea churning and swaying
before your eyes.  It looks very peaceful.  There is no sign of land
anywhere around you, at least no sign from this porthole.
~
E
boxes~
The boxes and crates are scattered throughout this immense room.  Some of
the boxes are covered in cobwebs and seem to have been here for years and
some of them dont even have any dust on them.  You can only wonder as to
what they all contain, but they probably would not be here if their contents
were useless.

A Hallway Within the Massive Ship``~
`hAs you walk along this hallway, you slowly grow accustomed the the rhythmic
groaning of the giant ship as it slowly shifts upon the waves.  The `bplanks`h of
the floor squeak slightly as you step on them.  Unlike being below deck on
most ships, there is plenty of room above you.  Large `bportholes`h run the length
of the west wall.  Beneath them, a `bhandrail`h runs seamlessly from the Captain's
quarters to the Firt Mate's.  A `btrapdoor`h in the floor indicates another part
of the ship even farther below.

trapdoor~
`hThe trapdoor in the deck here is obviously not hidden, yet, it is set into
the deck in such a way as not to call attention to itself.  While it is most
certainly large enough for anyone to enter, when you try it, you find it to be
securely locked from the other side.
~
E
handrail~
`hThe handrail is a single piece polished oak that runs straight and smoothly
the entire length of the west wall, where it lies underneath the portholes.
The handrail is polished smooth through years of use and many sets of hands
running along it.
~
E
portholes~
`hThe portholes are large and rimmed with polished brass.  Tiny hinges allow
them to be individually opened if the weather called for it.  They are each
just above shoulder level and spaced evenly along the west wall between the
Captain's Quarters and the First Mate's Quarters.
~
E
planks~
`hThe planks squeak as you step on them and the miniscule amount of give in
them assures you of just how sturdy this structure really is.  The planks are
spotlessly clean but worn as though they have felt the passage of many pairs
of feet through the years.

End of the Road``~
This room is the one place on the mud where you are free to do what you
want.  In fact, Finn will spot you an ale and a pie of your choice if you'll
kill an obnoxious noclan or point out the terrible behavior of the so-called
immortals.  We're all friends here.  Oh, and there's a really nice Gabbeh on
the floor, try not to spill anything on it.  If you're going to kill
someone, do it over there in the corner please.

rug~
This rug is rather small and almost square.  The pile is very thick and
the colors bright and warm.  The design is unbalanced and seems to shift as
you look at it.  The animals in the field also seem to move about slowly in
some sort of intricate dance.  
~
E
fools~
There are so many fools in love who have carved their unfortunate names
into the bar that you couldn't read them all in a week.  But a few which
seem carved with more intensity stand out from the others: 
Simkin and Aphrodite forever XXXOOO
The mage who dares not speak his name holds Runti forever in his bosom.
Serena Loves Stratis (and they both love Sidhe)
~
E
placard~
NO BRETHREN ALLOWED
~
E
door~
This door, leading presumably to the kitchen, is one of the smallest you
have ever seen.  Cooks, waitresses, farmers and assorted fools, numbskulls,
idiots and paladins duck through it in quick succession, often crashing into
each other as they go.  The door itself is painted bright yellow with a
green border.  Just above the door hangs a portrait of the right reverend
and holy Father Korin in the act of blessing a small wheel of cheese for a
young farmer.  A small placard hangs on the door.  
~
E
table~
There are tables of all different shapes here, many of them imported from
far off lands.  Most of them are darkly-stained, carved wooden tables and
they all appear to be quite old, except for a small, brightly-painted canthi
table near the bar.  Fish and birds intertwine all along the outer edge of
this round table in a mesmerizing pattern which supposedly has the power to
double the effectiveness of any alcoholic drink consumed by a person sitting
at the table.  
~
E
lamp~
This oil lamp is permanently attached to the table to prevent curious
delinquents like you from walking off with it.  It is painted with a
stylized image of Yorick's skull.  You notice that each lamp in the room is
painted with a different motif.  The slight fragrance coming from the
burning oil reminds you of nothing you have smelled before--maybe you
shouldn't sniff it too closely.  
~
E
fire~
This fire is really hot and there are no tables anywhere near it.  The
stone fireplace is almost entirely black, and a thick iron grate sits in
front of it to prevent lovesick young nobles from throwing themselves into
the fire.  A small bouquet of withered roses, encased in crystal, rests on
the mantle above the fireplace in remembrance of Althenna and her lover
Gardal, who killed themselves in this manner when their union was forbidden
by King Athanmere.  
~
E
bar~
This is the largest bar in Thesden.  Said to be carved by the famous,
wild elf, Thrugaar, during the days of his madness, it winds along the east
wall of the pub like a huge snake.  Tall stools with worn, silk-covered
cushions line the front of the bar, and pitchers of beer, bottles of wine
and flasks of strange liquids of all colors cover the top of the bar.  
~
E
sign~
On this sign, in large black letters, you see painted: NO BRAWLING 
~
E
finn~
Finn was here.
Or was he?
~
E
amber~
In one of the curves of the enormous bar, near the back wall and down low
next to the floor you find a small message carved in an awkward, child's
hand: Amber is my favorite color.  If it is a color, and even if it isn't,
does that really matter?  I hope she never leaves, Amber, cause when she
does, I'll be leaving too.

`hBefore you lies `kthe Alliant Council`h. There is a `olarge marble circular table`h
in the center of the room surrounded by `dhigh backed chairs of the most
precious woods`h. In the center of the table, there is a large crest
made of `osilver`h and `kamber`h.  Bookshelves line all around the room, bending
down with the weight of lenghty volumes.  Some titles included are `bThe Art of War`h,
`bPeace and Diplomacy`h, and `bParliamentary Procedures`h. The atmosphere is quiet and
reflexive.  Serious decisions must be made in this room.

The Captain's Quarters``~
`hThis room is fairly large, but then again, the ship that houses all of this
must be absolutely gigantic.  Looking around the room, you can see `bmaps`h
all over the walls.  A `blantern`h hangs in the corner of the room and sways
gently, casting odd shadows about the room.  On a `bstand`h in the corner sits
a beautiful blue `e`lMacaw```h who watches every move you make around the room.
There's a `bbed`h against one wall and a large sea `bchest`h at the foot of the bed.

ocean for many miles.
~
E

Maps of many lands are tacked around the room.  Many of them are written in

The songs of old fools ring faintly in your ears as you enter this cozy,
comfortable lounge.  Lit only by three small oil lamps mounted on the walls
nothing stands out too clearly as you look about.  You do notice some old,
faded paintings of forgotten heros as well as a dusty human skull lying on
the floor near one of the three divans.  A bookcase lines the west wall and
a worn yellow carpet brightens the center of the room.  A small placard is
mounted by the stairs which lead up to the real world.

As you find your reading glasses and put them on you see that this sign
reads: Please remove your shoes.  
~
E
carpet~
This musty rug has a faded yellow field sparsley littered with rough
animal and human figures of red, blue and green.  In the center of the rug
is a large red camel inside a blue diamond.  The tattered border is made of
alternating diamonds and triangles of blue and red.  If you didn't know
better, you might think this rug was woven by Grinj, the eight-fingered
elven weaver of old.  You can't believe this rug could be that old, until
you notice just how old the folks who are lounging in this room are
themselves.  
~
E
finn~
This appears to be a portrait of FInn sitting with a small army of
monsters in a forest glade.  But he is turned away from you and all you can
see is the back of his head.  From the wild silver and red hair full of
twigs and leaves, you assume this must be Finn.  The careless brushstrokes,
the wild colors, the complete disregard for perspective, as well as Finn's
pose itself all suggest that this might be a self-portrait.  In his hands he
holds a battered, wooden harp, which he is restringing, while on his right
shoulder is slung a set of multi-colored pipes.  Painted faintly across the
background is the score to Finn's first song: Eat Y'self Fitter.  
~
E
gil~
This very dark painting blurs the ouitlines of Gil's form slightly and he
almost seems to be a part of the murky background.  An almost magical effect
of the anonymous painter's art makes it appear that Gil's tail end is
constantly wiggling about.  The most noticeable feature of the painting,
speaking of his tail end, is Gil's tail itself.  It wraps about him several
times, slowly rising, obscuring the left half of his face.  It looks so
lifelike that you can barely restrain yourself from touching it.  A small
plaque below the painting reads: Please do not touch the painting.  This
note has been partly crossed out and in what looks to be Gil's own hand is
written: Feel free to touch the tail anytime.  
~
E
korin~
A heavy, gilt-edged frame surrounds this portrait of the Abbot of Cheese.
The tell-tale heavy brushstrokes of Krinbh, the Syvin genius, give the many,
moldy cheeses which fill the painting a rough and vibrant texture you can
almost smell.  Korin himself is pictured in the act of preaching a sermon in
the Cathedral, right arm raised high, cradling an eighty pound wheel of
Bruyere.  Bits of cheese fly from his mouth and a divine light shines forth
from his eyes, illuminating the many cheeses which surround him.  The
painting, you notice, hangs a little crookedly on the wall.  You wonder if
there might be something behind it...  
~
E
skull~
Yorick's skull looks like it hasn't been cleaned in years.  It has grown
a thick layer of moss and mold which gives off a faint glow.  While the
fools maintain possession of this holy relic, no force can defeat their
foolishness.  It is believed that the mad spirit of Yorick himself comes
once a year to inhabit the body of one of the Fools.  
~
E
table~
A huge, carved wooden table sits in the center of the room.  It looks
very old and you doubt it could support your weight, though that may say
more about you than the table.  Half-effaced carvings ring the edge of the
oblong-shaped top and, though they are hard to make out you think you see a
long, lizard-like tail wrapping its way through many of them as well as the
repeated motif of an empty head.  On one of the table's legs you see a new
inscription: Finn cut the cheese here.  
~
E
simkin~
Looking into this dark painting you think you see Simkin's body transform
itself into a huge broom.  As you contemplate this impossibility, you swear
that the broom is slowly detaching itself from the painting.  You hear
Simkin's voice scream into your ear, "Clear off!  You lout!"  As the broom
cracks over your unfortunate head.  
~
E
knagi~
This slightly-cracked painting hangs in a frame too small for it which
obscures the top of Knagi's large head.  A sly grin plays about his lips as
he realizes he has just accidentally sex-changed himself.  Much of the
painting remains unfinished, and you wonder if the artist fled in fear of
Knagi the Crazy's amorous advances.  A small, gold plate on the bottom of
the frame reads: YZARCEHTIGANK.  
~
E
divan~
The two mismatched divans seem to be worthy of equal attention.  The one
by the north wall, under the portrait of Gil, appears to be quite old,
perhaps even older than Gil himself.  Draped over the divan is a yellow and
red tapestry depicting the heroic (and temporarily successful) efforts of
Possum and Finn to drive all of the foul and fouler smelling dragons from
Thesden.  The second divan appears to be brand new and looks very
comfortable.  It sits below the recently erected shrine to Amber on the West
wall.  Upholstered in brown leather, tanned by Knagi's uncle JJ, just begs
for you to sit in it.  
~
E
amber's~
You see a very simple, possibly even tasteful, shrine to Amber.  Small
silver bay leaves intertwine to form a border around a circular mirror.  At
either side of the mirror are slowly burning candles that have been hand
made by the fools of old in memory of Amber.  
~
E
tygre~
You see a large, rough hole in the wall here where Tygre's portrait once hung
and you wonder to yourself where it might be now.

`mCatriana's Closet````~
`gPushing through a rack of dresses, you enter what seems to be a large
closet.  It might once have been a bedroom or a study, considering a
desk-shaped lump at one end, and a bed shaped pile at another.  Right now
it's dominated with `omirrors`g and `npretty clothes`g, though a few
comforts are still visible.  A `bsoft woven rug`g covers the floor.  A set
of delicate `kslipper-chairs`g surrounds a round wooden table already set
with `dtea`g.  The air somehow still resonates with the sound of many songs;
this is where Catriana practices.  Friends are always welcome, please stay a
while and make yourself comfortable!  Careful for that nightie....

Knagi and Aphrodite's Bedroom``~
`gThis is where Knagi and Aphrodite retire to be by themselves, or (more often)
together, away from the prying eyes of Thesden society. There is a nice big
`bwaterbed`g, a `bvanity `gfor Aphrodite, and a `bportrait `gof Knagi and Aphrodite
`gon the wall. It is also decorated with some of Knagi's favorite trophies such
`gas `bSurma's ears `gand `bCaitiph's eyeballs`g.

These are Surma's ears, which Knagi took when Surma kept leading him into

even less.

portrait~
This is a portrait of Knagi and his fair bride, Aphrodite. Knagi is sitting
on a 3-legged stool with Aphrodite on his lap. You wonder how the painter
was able to concentrate, having to stare at the beautiful Aphrodite for
so long. Consequently, Aphrodite is painted in MUCH more detail than Knagi.

Here is Aphrodite's vanity, where she gets ready for a hard day of

Ahh. This waterbed is soooooo comfortable. You just want to lay down and

Finn's Mausoleum and Cheese Shop``~
This small, dark shop smells fantastic; that is if you like cheese. 
There are several hundred varieties of cheese on shelves lining all the
walls of the shop.  In the center of the room is a table with a half-cut
wheel of Grieggrk, a smelly, greenish-hued Vroath cheese with a covering of
hair-like mold rising six inches above it.  A small sign invites you to try
some.

`ao`d==`a[ww`bwww `kThe Varruk's Thesden Outpost `bwww`aww]`d==`ao````~
You step into the Varruk camp and it is a hive of activity.  The Outpost
is nestled in the mouth of a valey that runs up to the hills behind.
Its slopes are covered in a mass of off-white tents that provide shelter
for the Vro'ath in between the many slave-gathering raids.  To the east
you see a large pen, the thick iron bars caked in rust but still strong.
This is where the slaves are kept, and you look on the scum inside.  A
mix of humans, elves and other degenerate races are chained within, this
has been a successful expedition so far.

War Against Intelligence``~
This is where the Fools meet to plan the manifold and diverse actions
which collectively make up their irrelevant war against intelligence. 
Around a low, oblong table sit 13 black chairs, stolen by Gil from the
Jhereg whorehouse.  A waterclock sits against the north wall and above it
hang 13 bells of different shapes and colors.  The famous Skull of Yorick,
founder of the Fools, sits upside down in the middle of the table, framed by
three books: Finn's _Manual of Irrelevance_, the famous _Treatise on
Nothing_, by Karembeu, the Sidhe Madman; and Pissalot's _Anatomy of Cheese_.

Welcome!  Please remove your clothes, take a towel if you wish, and make

~
E
anatomy~
Pissalot's masterwork, his inimitable and still entirely relevant tome
_The Anatomy of Cheese_, sits comfortably on the table, engulfed in more
varieties of mold than you care to count.  This is, of course, the first
edition, published by Henri Estienne, the rogue elven publisher and
bookseller executed in Thesden some three hundred years ago, ostensibly
because of the publication of this book.  Pissalot himself escaped
punishment by fleeing Thesden.  He later resurfaced as Cheesemaker to the
Vro'ath king, Krrgyk I.  This is believed to be the only copy of _The
Anatomy of Cheese_ in Thesden, though some claim that a second, signed copy
exists in the King's secret library.  The book is rather worse for the wear,
though this just suggests how much the fools and their friends treasure it. 
A small, scribbled note on the back end page, in what appears to be Finn's
hand, says: 'This book was most likely not authored by Pissalot at all, but
by his main rival in the ancient religious art of cheesemaking: Korin
Flatbottom, great great grandfather to the famed Father of Modern Cheese,
Father Korin, the first and holiest of fools.  
~
E
manual~
Finn's _Manual of Irrelevance_, popularly called the _Manual of
Irreverance_ went through six quick editions early in Finn's career but
seems to have fallen out of favor with the reading public since the
disappearance of certain folks from the land, most notably Cailet and Amber.
This copy is in pristine condition and you wonder, with its author, if
anyone has ever opened it, let alone read it in its entirety.  It's a large,
heavy tome, fully bound in green calfskin without even a speck of dust on
it.  As you look closely at the front cover, you notice a very faint image,
embossed in the leather.  You're not exactly sure what it represents, but it
looks a little like a can of worms.  Maybe you should open up the book and
try a little irrelevance (and possibly even irreverance) for yourself.

`aThe Mordant Poinard Parlor````~
After a few seconds, your eyes adjust to the dim lighting in this room. 
High on the walls, narrow slits serve as windows and barely allow light and
air in.  Several chairs, each of a different material and design, are
scattered around a large, circular rosewood table placed at the center of
the room.  The surface of the table is never bare.  Frequent visitors to
this parlor place dozens of valuables, few of them actually obtained through
purchase, on the table to admire or for others to appraise.  A pair of
expensive sofas sit quietly in one corner.  They offer comfortable seats and
good vantage point to study some of the many notes pinned to the walls by
thrown daggers.  The more important notes are generously decorated with at
least half a dozen stilettos.

`cGreen`dWood `gClan Hall````~
`cAs you enter the main hall of the fortress, you notice that the walls
`cand domed ceiling are not formed of any kind of masonry.  Rather, the
large witch `cwood trees grow very near to one another, and the thick black
vines that `cspiral the trunks reach out and intertwine to fill any gaps
that are formed.  High `cabove, the trees arch together to form a high domed
ceiling.  As the they taper `cout, the needle-covered branches form
intricate patterns that play with the light `cas is shines through and
`csplashes on the floor in radiant colors.
     `cThe bark of the witchwood is etched with runes of an ancient
`clanguage, to the uneducated they seem more like art that writing when
`ccompared to the crude commoners script.  Father up where the writing
`cfades out of your vision, large engraved `jpictures `cline the walls depicting
battles between the fair `cfolk and large black creatures you cannot name. 
Even higher up hanging from the `carched bows you see beautifully woven
`cSyvin `jtapestries `cthat must be at least two human lengths long. They show
`cpeacefull scenes of grand waterfalls and wind swept plains.
     `cYou finally pull your attention away from the awe inspiring walls and
notice that you are standing on a large hardwood floor.  The entire floor
looks `cto be one `csingle piece of wood as you see no seems or defects. 
The floor is hard `cas rock and your boots make a dull, heavy tapping sound
is if on stone `cinstead of wood.  As you look closer you see a small
`jetching `cmarking the otherwise undamaged floor.

expelled from the torches, giving the chest a divine glow of `ksunny`o yellow.

Shrine & Studio``~
You are in a sparsely furnished room that looks as if the people who live
in it had moved in a long time ago but never really got settled in.
Most prominent in the entryway is the presence of unpacked boxes containing
various holy items and household knick-knacks.  The room is devoid of 
furniture, but what is strikingly obvious is a sheer curtain of shimmering
and sparkling yellow light.  It is intangible, slightly transparent, and
seems to you to subdivide the room exactly in half.  Its length runs 
parallel with the portal.  On the near side of the room is the unkept
space, but on the far side of the curtain, you see wooden flooring and
peculiar walls that look as if they were crafted with optimal accoustics
in mind. That half of the room is devoid of any object or furnishing, save
an elegant grand piano furbished in classic, stained mahogany.

Divergence~
The wood diverges, the darkness split by a shining path, peace unto
turmoil conjoined by absolution.  Your feet tread, without defilement, this
silver path laid graciously before the slender trees who hold court here.  A
path of enlightenment, each step takes you further from the roads you have
mapped, into the vast unknown.  Un erringly, moved by primal curiosity, you
forget onwards, deeper and deeper, tracing your soul through the trees.

The awe inspiring sight of this gate would impress even the most arrogant of
dwarves.  Its double doors stand an astounding 24 feet into the air, and its
width is nearly two feet of beaten bronze.  The only thought that can come to your
head is "How many slaves died in the forging of these gates...

You step into the billowing tent and instantly feel the aches and pains
of a hard days slaving literally slip away.  Who could imagine a more
relaxing atmosphere?  The tent is made from some elf-hides sown together
in a patchwork fashion, hides serve well to keep out the rain and wind
that howels outside.  The distinctive scent of roasting human wafts in from
the kitchens outside, and you can't help but let out a sigh of contentment.
You lower yourself to the plush rug that carpets the rocky ground beneath
and slip into a deep sleep filled with dreams of maiming and pillaging.

`kCathedral Holy Relics and Vestments``~
As you walk in to this quiet, incense-scented shop, you immediately
notice the hundreds of religious artifacts and relics on display here.  What
is most noticable of this impressive collection is that it spans across many
races: there are crosses of every size and material imaginable, Ne'Shajh
fetishes of stone and bone, artistic impressions of the Syvin Goddess of
Water, and even minature Elvish prayer trees.  Many types and styles of
vestments can be seen, hanging on the racks nearby.  All of the relics and
vestments, both of the mundane and mystical classes, are tactfully displayed
in this well-appointed shop on shelves, in display cases and the like.

You enter a small, ramshackle shack built on the west side of the pier. 
The quiet lapping of the Severn River can be heard through the many places
where the boards have fallen off and through a large, jagged hole in the
floor.  Small watercraft traversing up and down the river can be seen
through the northern wall.

As you step inside this well worn tent you realize you're here for one
purpose.  This is the tent in which all the Varruk ceremonies take place,
where wars are planned and celebrations are held.  The centre of the room is
wide open, blood stains the floors and the tables that surround it on three
sides are made from a strong oak.  Several types of weapons are piled upon
each table as well as food and drink.  An elf skull filled with red ink has
been skewed atop a long crooked staff that  has been planted well into the
ground near the ntre table, tied to it is a small knife engraved with the
runes of the great Ne'shajh.

Mystical Musings``~
You are in the entrance of an elaborate residence of an elf who makes
Thesden his home.  The feeling of magic gives you a sense of awe as you walk
through the room.  You look around, but with the shimmer in the air, it's
sometimes hard to tell where things begin and end.  You do notice a sign
that infers that the mage may use this home to suppliment his retirement
income when he quits adventuring by using it to enchant weapons, armor, and
even creatures of this magnificent land.  Until retirement becomes
inevitable, you will have to look for Xorkc exploring the wilderness and
request the costs for the same services.

`kThe Entrance to the `iLibertad`k Safehouse````~
`i
You enter the entrance room of the Libertad safehouse.  It is filled with
with crates of weapons, armor, food, and other supplies required by freedom
fighters.  On one wall is a `kposter`i made to encourage others to join clan
Libertad.  On another wall is a `kpainting`i depicting a large mob of peasants
gathering behind the leadership of a few charismatic young generals in
preparation to fight their oppressive lords and knights.  Behind a few of
the crates are the revolutionaries who plot against Lord Vryce.  These
courageous young men and women have not only donated space for clan Libertad
to use, but have volunteered to help guard it, too!  The entrance to this room
is well-hidden, as well, and a complicated system of false doors makes it
virtually impossible for non-clan members to enter.  Luckily clan members
can enter and leave quickly, as they have practiced extensively.
You notice a bulletin `kboard`i that is sometimes updated with new information.``

use them as well.  Our ranks are not a license to tell people below you in rank
what to do.  Rather they are symbols of accomplishment.  They should reflect
experience and dedication to the clan.  The highest two ranks are clan leader
and deputy.  The members of these ranks are mentioned individually.  Anyone who
attains the level of 60 while in the clan, or demonstrates true dedication to
the clan will also be made a deputy.  The rest of the ranks are automatic.

poster~
You see a poster of a young man staring proudly towards the sky.  It is black
on a red background.  The young man carries a scythe and is standing in a field
of wheat.  At the bottom of the poster is "Libertad" in large letters, and
"The clan for freedom; the clan for tomorrow." in smaller letters.
~
E
painting~
This painting was made by a skilled artist.  You almost fail to notice the
subtle, persuasive details.  For example, the sky above the mob of peasants
is a beautiful blue, but as your attention moves across the wheat field
that looks to be the battleground, you notice the sky takes on a shade of
gray.  Above the lords and their knights the sky has only the slightest bit
of blue.  Also, the hand-made weapons of the peasants shine brightly, but
the armor and blades of the knights seem dulled by shadow.  The peasants
wear grim looks of determination, while the knights leer at the force of
commoners before them.  It becomes quite obvious to you which side the
painter was on.  You wonder who the painter was, but there is no signature.

`hYou stand on a huge corridor made of `kAmber`h stone and `oWhite`h
marble.  It is lined with beautiful `omithril and silver chandeliers`h and
statues on marble of legendary heroes and leaders of Alliant, both from old
and new.  A large Statue of `kGoddness Amber`h dominates the corridor, as it
is located at the center.  A smaller statue of `kLord Havoc`h, Prince of
Alliant, is near by.  Even smaller statues of the deputies of Alliant are
next to the exits of the room, from which you are able to reach beautiful
gardens and the training grounds.  There is a list on the wall with the
names of the people on the statues.

Lord Quetzal, Knight of the Silver Blade (Then First Knight of Alliant)
Lord Warren, Knight of the Golden Dragon

~
E
quetzal~
The statue of Quetzal, the second of the Stewards of `kthe Alliant Order`h
and `oFirst Knight of Alliant`h stands here.  He seems different from all other
Alliant Knights, as his face has a different configuration.  You can tell he is
from far away lands.  Anyways, he seems fair and stands with dignity.  Strangely,
he wields no weapon, but stands with his hands crossed in his chest.  A sad look
is in his face, maybe thinking of his homeland.  His shield stands at the floor,
and it shows a `kfeathered serpent`h, the crest he chosed for his newly founded
line.
~
E
galiont~
`hThis is the statue of Lord Galiont, the first of the Great Stewards of the
`kAlliant Order,`h and `oKnight of the Silver Blade`h.  He looks tall and
handsome, and you can tell he is a man who loves to charm women. Son of a
Demi-Godness and a mortal, he stands straight with a proud expression in his
face, wielding the holy sword "Blessed Destroyed" in his right hand, and
holding a shield with the emblem of a `bred`h rose on in.
~
E
raiden~
`hThe statue of Raiden the Avatar, `oPriest of the White Cross`h.  Although
the statue is the same size as the others, you can tell the actual size of
this huge cleric.  Wielding a hammer almost as tall as the statue itself and
wearing the `odivine white robes of `kAlliant`h, the statue instills
intimidation. One of the few dwarfs in the Order, he quickly raised in grades
due to his strong faith and relentless fight against `bevil`h.
~
E
amber~
You see a beautiful marble statue of Angel Amber, Patron of Alliant. She is 
fair beyond the measures of men, and kind and just, but deadly at the same
time.  She wields a large `bflamming sword`h in her left hand and the `oLight
of knolegment`h on her right hand.  She is showed with beautiful `omithril armor`h
and wears no helm, her hair cascading beautifully over his perfect oval face.
~
E
kaitlin~
You stand before the statue of Mother Kaitlin, Priestess of the Amber Rose.
She stands dressed in holy robes holding a cross in the right hand
and a rose in the left hand.  She wields no weapon, but
you know she does not need it, as her faith on god is so
strong that she can move mountains.
~
E
havoc~
This is a statue of marble of Lord Havoc, `oPrince of Alliant`h.  He mounts a
Powerful `kGolden Dragon`h, and wields A Lance of Pennance on his right hand. 
He seems to be looking far away, maybe looking in the heart of his foes for 
`iEvil`h.  His shield shows the crest of Alliant, Golden Dragon with White 
banners on Amber field. The kindness and justice that emanates from this statue 
soothe your heart and calm your soul.

evan~
Here stands the Statue of Lord Evan, `kKnight of the Amber Rose`h.  He stands 
tall and fair, fearsome and at the same time kind.  He wields a huge steel 
sword, which holds at his side, and is coated all in `omithril mail`h and silver 
armor.  His shield is next to his feet, at the floor, showing a beautiful rose,
and he wears no helmet.

Under the Main Mast of the `vS.S. Ragnar``~
`hYou are standing on the deck of the largest ship in the `bport`h of Thesden.
From your vantage point high above the harbor, you can look down on the other
smaller ships docked nearby.  The `bdeck`h spreads out in all directions around
you and the giant main `bmast`h of the ship climbs nearly a hundred feet into
the sky above you, sails rolled and tied.  Above the sails sits the `bcrow's
nest`h, the highest point on the ship.  The ship is flying two large `bflags`h
which flutter powerfully in the strong sea breeze.  The highest is a white
flag with the markings `g><`c><`g><`h on it and below that, flies the more
well-known and respected Jolly Roger, the universal symbol of the pirate ship.

E
flags~
`hThe two giant flags that fly high on the ship's main mast display both who
the owners of the ship are, and also what their intentions are.  The highest
is the emblem of the Mercenary clan, a symbol of power and longevity.  Right
below it flies the Skull and Crossbones, the universal mark of the pirate. 
The fact that this ship would have the gall to fly the pirate flag while in
the port of Thesden is surpassed in amazement only by the fact that none of
the town's guards have attempted to change this situation.
~
E
crow's~
`hThe crow's nest appears to you as a tiny platform poised at the very top of
the ship's mast above even the highest riggings and sails.  From there, you
imagine a sailor with a spyglass must be able to see for over twenty miles in
any direction in clear weather.
~
E
mast~
`hThe mast of the S.S. Ragnar climbs high into the sky above you.  The mast
is perfectly round and straight, a true monument to the skill of the master
who designed this ship and thick enough that you could not wrap your arms
around it and still clasp your hands at the base.
~
E
deck~
`hThe deck of the large ship stretches out in all directions around you.
Tempered by extremes of time, wind, sun, water, and salt, the boards seem
virtually indestructable.  As you walk upon them, they creak ever so slightly
and it gives you a sense of comfort to move around the deck as the ship rocks
gently on the waves below.
~
E
port~
`hThe port of Thesden is an active and bustling harbor area consisting largely
of merchant ships and private vessels.  By day, the docks teem with activity
as merchants, sailors, and adventurers mingle and go about their business.  At
night, however, the port area teems with a different kind of activity, as
Thesden's docks are notoriously dangerous after dark.

Foredeck of the `vS.S. Ragnar``~
`hHere at the front of the ship, the deck slopes upwards towards the `bprow`h at
the very foremost point.  This is so that when the ship is at sea in rough
waters, the breaking waves that make it onto the deck of the ship, wash away
quickly and don't pool, which could sink the ship almost instantly.  Also,
the first and smallest of three `bmasts`h is here, covered in rigging.  The sails
are rolled and tied, as the ship is in port.  Hanging below the prow of the
ship is a large `bfigurehead`h.  Two mighty `banchors`h, each larger than you, hang
at rest from the sides of the ship.

E
anchors~
`hThe anchors of the ship are giant in size and massive in weight, as they must
be in order to stop a ship as large as this from drifting on the waves.
Leading up from them is a long chain that is spun neatly around a capstan on
each side of the deck.  The chain is enormous and a single link must weigh
twenty pounds.
~
E
figurehead~
`hThe figurehead that hands below the prow of the ship is that of a female Elf
and a mage by the looks of her.  She is wearing very little, as she is indeed
a figurehead and built for the view of sailors.  The fact that an Elf mage was
chosen as the figurehead of this ship is ironic and, no doubt, a sick joke on
Possum's part.
~
E
masts~
`hThe forward mast is the smallest of the three on the ship, the largest one
being in the middle and then the rear mast slightly larger than this one.
Each of the masts is a spiderweb of riggings and ropes securing the masts to
the sails, the sails to the masts, and this masts to the hull.  This ship,
like all tall ships, is a masterpiece of seamanship.
~
E
prow~
`hThe prow of the ship juts forward from the hull in a menacing fashion.  While
its main purpose is to be a forward base for riggings to be tied to secure the
sails and masts, this one is tied with iron bands and tipped with a fistlike
steel ball at the end, making the ship a deadly tool for ramming on the high
seas.

Aft Deck of the `vS.S. Ragnar``~
`hHere in the rear of the ship, you can imagine what it must look like out at
sea with the ocean stretching off before you.  Looking towards the front, you
gaze past the rearmost of the three `bmasts`h, which is larger than the frontmost
mast, yet a good bit smaller than the main mast, which lies in the center of
the ship.  Looking off past the rear of the ship, you see Colwyn `bBay`h and the
ocean beyond it.  And even though you cannot see it, you know that it's only
a short journey southward to Ebon Downs.  Lastly, but by no means leastly,
your eyes fall upon the well-known Captain's `bwheel`h, which guides the ship at
at sea.
~

E
wheel~
`hThe Captain's wheel is a sight familiar to everyone, be they Land Lubbers
or Salty Dogs of the Sea.  The wheel measures five feet across and has ten
spokes positioned around it for maximum ease of spinning.  On a ship as large
as this, the rudder can tend to drift with the current, so the wheel can be
held in place easily by slipping a loop of rope around the tip of one of the
spokes.
~
E
bay~
`hColwyn Bay is the harbor of Thesden.  The waters inside the bay are always
calm in all but the fiercest storms.  Tucked neatly out of the way of the
ocean, ships can maneuver carefully around the docks without fear of giant
swells and choppy waters.
~
E
masts~
`hThe rear mast is criss-crossed with ropes and riggings, with its single sail
roleld and tied while the ship is in port.  Unlike the massive sails held by
the main mast, these sails aid in giving the ship direction as the rudder is
turned to direct the ship.

The Inner Sanctum``~
You have entered a large room, slightly lit with candles in each corner
You feel an unearthly aura of peace and tranquility that compels you into
silence.  The entrance is filled with polished blocks of rare, magical white
and grey marble, and illuminated by several small globes on top of silver
rods.  To your left and right tall columns of white marble support the
ceiling some hundred feet above.  The floor is tiled with smooth heavy
stones carved by an ancient race of Dwarves.  The soft aroma of frankincense
fills the area and sends an overpowering feeling of relaxation throughout
your entire body.  Ancient tapestries of superb artistic design depicting
Gods and Goddesses and the history of the Brotherhood Clan hang loosely on
the walls.  A small crystal alter stands at the far end, in front of which a
column of holy light keeps a small crystal shard suspended midair.  Directly
behind the alter a beautiful stained glass window depicts a Holy Knight of
the Brotherhood slaying a legion of evil Sidhe while the great God Chaos
himself looks on contentedly.  A table near the entranceway holds several
books of chants and prayers.  Smoke from a cone of incense twirls lazily up
towards the ceiling.

`cHall ``of the `lBrotherhood``~
`dThe wide oak doorway`` opens up to an oddly shaped room. It seems much to 
large to fit here, but somehow it does so quite well. There are `bhuge couches
and chairs in this room covered in a rich wine color.`` They sink comfortably
deep as you take a moment from your travels to rest here. If you weren't such
a busy person you might find this the perfect place to settle in with some 
good food and your Brothers for a few good hours of relaxation. `fIn one 
corner a built-in bar holds racks of expensive colored liquids. ``Ine the 
center of the hall there is a `ocircular crystallized tube`` that shoots up to
the ceiling leading you to the `lprivate domain of the Brothers.

`mThe `lMystical `jChamber ``of the `iGreat `lX`jA`oO`mS``~
As you enter this room you are filled with both fear and awe. Surrounded by
`lwisps of cool mist,`` you stand on a `khuge golden disc`` `ofloating high
above a pit which seems to have no bottom.`` Looking down you start with
terror and awe. You are magically suspended over a great `bv`oo`fr`et`je`kx
`aGrey swirling mist spins rapidly. `ipowerful bolts of lightning streak from 
the sides and `qEXPLODE `iwith sparks and flames.`` Spectral images
and windows to other worlds appear and dissappear in an instant on the surfac
of the `achurning mist.`` Out of the corners of your eyes may be seen strange
shapes, yet nothing is visible when you turn to look directly. In one 
direction (you are not sure which) there is a large `iburning fireplace`` 
suspended about two feet from the edge of the disk. `lHanging above it is a
large portrait of the fearless clan leader, Lord Xaos, `qDISMEMBERING `la 
`gvroath scout `lwith one blow from his `omagical sword.

Starboard Deck of the `vS.S. Ragnar``~
`hThe starboard deck of the ship gives you the best view of Thesden's `bwharf`h
district.  Looking down onto the docks, you see the variety of `bpeople`h that
Thesden attracts on a daily basis.  Merchants move hither and yon, trading the
wares they have for a day's living.  Sailors labor beneath cargo headed onto
and off of the many ships that come and go.  Along the docks lie several very
familiar sights such as the Shipwright's `bShop`h and the Rusty Nail `bTavern`h.

E
wharf~
`hThe wharf is rather large, consisting of four large docks that run hundreds
of feet into Colwyn Bay.  The area is in a state of constant use, be it day or
night.  Ships from all ports come to Thesden.  On a given day, you can see the
ships from Ebon Downs, Freeport, and even an occasional traveller from the
City of the Sun.
~
E
people~
`hThe people of Thesden are a lesson in diversity.  Members of all castes and
social levels mingle in the streets and nobody seems to be bothered too much
by it.  It's easy to see a beggar and a noble within line of sight of each
other.  Farmers from the prairie to the east, mix with the nobles from the
south near the Castle Dunlunce.  Merchants from the sea mix with Knights from
the Argent Stronghold to the north.
~
E
shop~
`hAsrac's Ship store is one of the oldest in Thesden.  Asrac, formerly a
journeyman, recently inherited the shop from his master, Versiz.  He's a young
and ambitious shipbuilder with a talent beyond his years, but his confidence
is not yet that of the true master he will grow to become.
~
E
tavern~
`hThe Rusty Nail Tavern is one of the most frequented establishments on the
west side of Thesden.  Sailors from the ships come and go during all hours of
the day and night, offering Laisa the barkeep little time for sleep within her
impressive (or oppressive) working schedule.  But for what it's worth, the pay
simply cannot be beaten.

You are in a huge master bedroom that overlooks Cumberland Avenue in
Thesden.  Like the rest of the house, calmness and nature are prevalient
throughout the decorations of the room.  The walls are covered in bark of a
tree uncommon to this area and the huge canopy bed makes you feel that you
are under a towering oak tree.  One can almost feel lightning of a warm
spring day through the misty haze of the room.  From the decorations of the
rest of the house and emphasized in this room, you can also feel the sadness
Xorkc feels at being displaced from his homeland.

Though you know that this is a bathroom, it would be hard to imagine a

The toilet is made out of a tree stump and how it removes waste and remains
clean would be impossible to figure out by all but the most powerful of
mages.  A waterfall drops down from near the ceiling at a perfect
temperature for taking a shower and small stream ends in a pool at the right
height for a wash basin.

Port Deck of the `vS.S. Ragnar``~
`hYou are standing on the `bdeck`h of a huge ship.  From where you stand now, the
ship extends to the north, south, and east.  The main `brail`h runs along the 
west side of the ship.  Looking over it, you can see the `bocean`h swelling and
large waves crashing against the side of the giant ship some thirty feet
below.  Looking around you, you have a tremendous view of the surrounding
lands.  Far off to the west lie gently rolling `bhills`h and flatlands.  To the
northeast lies the `bcity`h of Thesden.  Beyond to the north, you can see the
peaks ot the shale `bmountains`h.  To the east, you can see a `bprairie`h past the
far gates of Thesden and to the south, there is nothing but the ever-churning
sea.

Straining your eyes to look far to the north beyond the gates of Thesden, you
can make out the dark shadowy peaks of a land that looks rugged and wild. You

city~
To the northeast lies the thriving metropolis that is Thesden.  Each day,
the streets of Thesden bustle with merchants, nobility, children, and even
other adventurers, sometimes numbering into the hundreds.  To the south of
Thesden lies the Castle Dunlunce.

Off to the southwest, you can see the gently rolling hills of the Macocaap
outlands.  The ground is wild and undeveloped by farm or town.  Beyond the
hills is impossible to see in the distance.

ocean~
Light refracts off the dancing waves of the water, sending sparkles of shine
and glisten all around you. It is a good thing that you find that
interesting, because there isn't much else around you.  Water, water, water
and air, their colors blending into one perfectly woven mesh, a blur of
grey and blue that never seems to end, and never even seems to begin.  It is
a paradox that only one lost at sea has the time or inclination to ponder.
The churning of the waves rock you back and forth, a soothing motion that
soon has you feeling sick.  Yet another paradox in this massive pool of
salt and water.
~
E
rail~
The rail is thick and covered with a spiderweb of riggings.  Belaying pins
are put into the side of the ship to hold the various ropes from the masts in
place while the ship is at sea.  The sails are rolled now though, as the ship
is in port.
~
E
deck~
The deck of the ship is made of a dark wood, perhaps oak.  The gentle creak as
you walk along does more to calm your nerves than to give you worry.  The ship
sways mildly upon the waves in a way that only the truly large ships can.  The
deck is well-worn, but kept as tidy as the day it was christened.

`hThe catwalk you stand on now is large enough to support several grown men
carrying cargo aboard.  The ramp is about eight feet wide and the surface of
it is covered with a rough material to ensure maximum grip for those walking
along it.  The sides of the catwalk have railings of chain strung between
posts placed every five feet.  The ramp, of course, leads westward to the
ship itself, whose deck lies twenty feet above the docks, and another ten
feet still to the water below.

`hThe deck of the ship looks much smaller from up here.  It's almost like you
are looking at a detailed model ship from high above.  The spiderweb of ropes
and riggings find their way down from the masts and sail to the deck of the
ship, making a quite-climbeable system of movement high above the ship.
~
E
water~
`hThe water is calm, as you are in port, but even so, it must be very deep if
this ship is docked here.  The water is blue-green and translucent, but since
you cannot see the bottom, it is very difficult to tell just how far you can
see into it.
~
E
rail~
`hThe outermost rail of the ship is about fifteen feet on either side of you.
You'd think that if you got a good push, then you could get out past the rail
then maybe the hundred-foot fall might not kill you.  But if your foot were
to slip even slightly, it would be you on the deck like ground meat.

`aParlous' storage closet of `aDOOM!``~
`kDeftly stepping to the left and narrowly avoiding a huge swinging axe trap, you quickly duck under a series of
poisoned darts launched at you from an unknown location.  Jumping over a tripwire, then combat rolling under 
a stake trap, you come to a skidding stop just in front of one of Parlous' many storage boxes.  With practiced 
moves, you step to the side of the box and open it, stepping back far enough to avoid the wildly swinging
swordblades that pass inches from your face.
The walls are mirrored, so room proportions are impossible to distinguish, especially with the glitter of countless
millions in gold laying around, as if unneeded.  Rare and priceless artifacts are scattered about haphazardly,
and one depraved soul has taken to leaving the skulls of his victims here, pinned to the mirrored wall with hollow-bird stilettos.

`h.`o:`c(`jThe Grand Hall of Insanity`c)`o:`h.````~
`cAs you enter through the heavy door, again you are taken aback by what
your eyes see.  The inside of the mighty oak in which this complex is 
built is cavernous.  The entire inside of the tree has been hallowed out 
leaving only a smooth circular room.  Your eyes move upward as you look to 
see just where the Grand Hall ends, but there seems to be no end in sight.  
Crossing above the room every floor for many stories are rope bridges made 
of `jbright green ivy`c.  They cross back and forth between doors and other 
rooms that you cannot see.  Squinting to find the ceiling to the room, you 
notice that it simply fades away into darkness, with no visible end to it.
`c
The sounds of bubbling `nw`ga`nt`ge`nr `cfill your ears as you tear your eyes away 
from above and look to the middle of the room.  Your eyes are treated to a 
finely crafted `astone `cpool filled with water bubbling up from an unseen 
source.  In the middle of the pool there is a pedestal on which stands a 
life-size statue of a grinning donkey.  Oddly, the donkey is wearing a 
make-shift horn on its head that leans slightly off-center making the 
statue all the more enchanting and disturbing.  Near the edge of the pool, 
a `db`kronz`de `dt`kable`dt `crests with some words chiseled into it.
`c
Along the smooth walls on this lowest level, there are three doorways.  
Directly across from the entrance to the Grand Hall, there is an open door 
with stairs that can be seen through it leading up and down in a spiral.  
Along the northern wall, there is another door, this one closed, but with 
a sign made of wood and with the word, '`jStoreroom`c,' engraved upon it 
hanging from a nail.  To the south, there is an unmarked door, this one is 
also closed.  Next to all of these doors, there are hanging balls of light 
which help to illuminate the room.

Before there was ever a young donk... `g-`nunicorn`g- `hnamed `mTurnip`h; there was
his beloved predesessor, `iR`oa`id`oi`is`oh`h.
`h
`iR`oa`id`oi`is`oh`h was a brave d... `g-`nunicorn`g- `hand lived in the wilderness with 
his friend `jT`calon`jS`clayer`h.  Upon the creation of `j.`m:(`jc`mr`ja`mz`je`md`j):`m.`h, `iR`oa`id`oi`is`oh`h came to 
pull the mighty wagon that those in the clan would call home.  However, 
one fateful day, `iR`oa`id`oi`is`oh`h was struck down as he stepped into one of the 
numerous potholes filling `eThesden's `hstreets and was rendered lame.  Sadly, 
his friend `jT`calon`jS`clayer `hwas forced to put give `iR`oa`id`oi`is`oh`h a quick death so as 
to not prolong the suffering of the aging don.. `g-`nunicorn`g-`h.
`h
To this day, `iR`oa`id`oi`is`oh`h will never be forgotten, because even though a new

as noble as `iR`oa`id`oi`is`oh`h.

The Havoc Estate.``~
You have entered the home of the Prince of Alliant, Havoc, and his loving 
wife, the Princess Clairdelune.  On the west wall you see a quaint
loveseat, and beyond that is a beautiful view from the bay windows, which
are adorned with flowing burgandy drapes.  The north wall is decorated with
a landscape painting, which hangs above the mantle of the stone fireplace,
and two plush leather lounge chairs sit comfortably before a warm fire.  An
oval, dark green mable coffee table rests here to the east.  The center of
the table is inlaid with the golden symbol of 'Alliant'.  The base of this
costom built artwork depicts the history and glory of the Alliant Clan.  To
the south, the french mohagany doors add to the splendor and peaceful
atmosphere of this room.  It is truly a home built with love, from love.

PICKPROOF NOBASH original name: 'The Tempest's Eye'~
You step from the branch into what looks like a sod hut barely supported
by the tree branch.  Suddenly you realize this room is much larger on the
inside than on the outside.  Wooden beams of living tree form a vaulted
ceiling, walls, and floor.  A engraved wooden counter is in front of you.  A
pleasant you man seemingly made of fog and vapors stands patiently waiting
for you order.  In a back room you can see a pair of disembodied hands
scribbling frantically into a journal, occasionally tossing a finished
journal casually into a large pile behind it.  Behind the bench are several
shelves, with journals, books, librams, and other documents piled
haphazardly.  Below the lowest shelf is a sign saying "Welcome to The
Tempest's Eye, see anything you like?"  In painted red letters.  A rack ov
vials lies out of reach behind the shade, holding quietly bubbling brews. 
As you take this all in, your eye is caught by a brooch on the young clerk's
misty lapel.

la Mode d'Exodus``~
As soon as you enter this opulent building, you are struck with senses
of wealth and quality.  The decorative theme here appears to be creamy 
white marble columns shot with bolts of slate grey streaks and mirrored 
walls that span from floor to ceiling.  Where the walls meet the ceiling, 
soft lavender and mauve lights hang in mid-air--likely of magical nature.  
In the middle of the long chamber, an eyecatching chandelier hangs, crafted 
of wrought brass in a dynamic, modern-art style that gives it a life of its 
own which it seems to cast about the room as surely as it adds brightness 
to the level of luminance.  The floor is made of beige marble tiles that has
rich red carpetting in the main aisles of the store.
   A quick glance around the room reveals prices that are enough to widen
the eyes of most, or at least raise an eyebrow.  On the counterside, the
quality of the merchandise looks as if it has no rival in any other
establishment in the world.  Additionally, the selection is astounding.
   Clearly, _la Mode d'Exodus_ is the place to go for Fashion and
Accessories.  Wondering what to look at first, your eyes fall quickly upon
a _sign_ hanging on one of the wall mirrors.  There is also glass _case_
on display in one corner, as well as a _plaque_ below the _sign_.

in height.  It is made of nondescript, transparent glass on all sides but the
bottom, which sports an inclined, red velvet surface.  Inside, is a
neatly laid out collection of silver coins.  As you are wondering about the
exact amount, you notice a small silver plate on the top of the case, 
engraved with the wording: "This was the payment received for a certain
flamboyant pink beret, as purchased by Possum for 200 silver pieces."
~
E
plaque~
The plaque is fashioned from pure gold, and measures about two stilettos in

::The poopdeck of the Ship of Fools::``~
As you stroll out of the bar (WAAAAAY out of the bar), you see a nice
room that overlooks the sea. You wonder how the sea wandered into the
Krathen Keep, but then you see Knagi and Finn staring out at the sea and
decide to keep quiet about it. As you scan the room, Catriana splashes
you with water, and Korin swims about your feet (Don't ask). A sign
hangs on the wall, asking to be read.

The Meat Locker``~
`hThe first thing you notice about this room, which is tucked away deep within
the depths of the ship, is it's temperature.  It's downright chilly in here.
Lining the room on all sides is a giant wooden `bcabinet`h with large drawers that
pull out.  These drawers appear to be about the right size for a corpse to fit
in.  The `bfloor`h is painted a crimson red, which does nothing to soothe your
already-tense nerves.  The `bcorners`h of the room are not quite cubical, and the
room takes on a kind of unnatural feeling as a result.  The walls seem a bit
taller on one side and seem to come in a bit towards the ceiling.  Or maybe
you are just imagining things.  There's a faint and almost indiscriminate
odor in the room of ice-packed meat.  At any rate, you feel a rather strong
compulsion to not be in this room alone, for even by yourself, you know you
are never truly alone in here.

cabinet~
`hThe cabinet reaches from floor to ceiling and the drawres pull out six feet
to reveal the lifeless contents.  Many of the faces are mangled or obscured by
ice beyond the point of recognition.  Shockingly, you also see a few that you
do recognize.
~
E
corners~
`hWhen you look at the corners of the room everything looks fine, but when you
look at the wall as a whole, you can see that things just do not match up
squarely.  It's such a minor thing, but why does it keep catching your eye?
~
E
floor~
`hThe floor of the room is probably the most disturbing feature of all.  Why in
God's name would someone paint the floor of a morgue blood red?  Regardless, it
has been done.  Between the painted floor, the odd smell that the room has,
the chill of the room, and the unusual lighting scheme in here, the room takes
on a sort of synthetic feel to it.

This is where the servants often hang out during their many free hours of
the day while working for Xorkc.  Pictures adorn the walls and there are
games, books, snacks, and other objects of timewasting enjoyment laying all
around the room.  A deck of cards is scattered haphazardly against one of
walls making you feel that someone did not take his losses too kindly. 
Dirty mugs lie around the room and you realize the necessity of the large
separation between the spotless mansion and the servants quarters.  After
cleaning the main house, relaxation is more important for the servants than
spotless living conditions.

`o=(`k@`o)=`h Training Grounds of the `kAlliant`h Order `o=(`k@`o)=````~
`kYou stand inside the White tower in a open space used by the `oKnights
of the Alliant Order`k to sharpen their skills, looking forward at the fight
against evil.  Some powerful Grand Knights and Templars walk around teaching
the young students the art of sword fencing and powerful clerics stand

Swords and lances lay against a wall, and different pieces of Alliant
Standard Armor are piled in the corners.  Some dummies are also here, cut
and mangled by the many hits and charges they have received.

SubBasement``~
This room uses the old pirate trick of having a false treasure above the
important goods, so anyone finding the first hidden location assumes they
found it all and doesn't continue searching to locate the good stuff.  If
you're in here, the owner messed up and probably isn't happy.

`bThe Parlous trophy room``~
`lThis room serves as a grisly reminder to the strength of the clan in combat.  The walls have been papered in
sidhe skin, with elaborate shelves crafted from rib and fingerbones supporting most of the trophies.  Along the 
northern wall, countless skulls of varying species have been piled, the names of the victims carefully etched into
their foreheads.  The eastern wall is full of jars of parts: eyeballs, hearts, tounges, and some unidentifiable.
These are a tribute to those who have crossed Parlous in days past.  The western wall is a glistening weapons rack,
with some of the most bizarre and violent weapons ever designed glistening in racks, some dripping with poison,
some still dripping with blood.  The southern wall is a tribute to Parlous members past.  Their skulls have been
arranged similar to the northern wall, but the marks on the forehead are different.  Written in the secret toungue
of the ancient thieves guild, these marks indicate how many people they had killed before they themseles were done in.
Glancing at the number of skulls, and the number of marks, your best guess would indicate that thousands had died
at the hands of these murderers, and you smile slyly, hoping that someday your head adorns this wall, too.

`o=(`k@`o)=`h Private Council of the Leaders `o=(`k@`o)=````~
`hThis room could be described with a single word: `bluxury`h. Built to hold
private meetings between the leaders of the `kAlliant clan`h, no money has been
spared to make the best and most confortable place in the whole `oWhite Tower`h.
There is a `dsmall round table made of oak`h with `kgold incrustations`h, surrounded
by three small chairs. In a corner there is also a couch long and wide enough
to hold two people lying, which maybe was put there under the influence of
Lord Galiont when looking at the voluptuous servant maids that the `oAlliant Order`h
hired. However, it looks unused yet.

furnace containing a ball of `if`ki`ir`ke`d, radiating enough `bheat`d to
maintain the warm temperature.  Soft, sun-dried `kstraw`d layers the ground

`hYou stand inside the famous chapel inside the `oWhite Tower.`h Although it is
smaller than the cathedral, it is known because of its religious paintings
on the walls and the `fp`eo`gl`byc`gh`hro`gm`ba`gt`ee`fd`h glassworks in the windows. The pews are made
of the `dfinest wood`h and have cushions of `opure white silk`h.  A `klarge cross made
of gold`h is located just behind and above the Altar, creating a view of pure
holiness and almighty power, and a interesting contrast with the
`blong red carpet`h that leads to it, carpet which has been stepped by several
generations of members of the Alliant Order on the way to knightship,
to pay their condolences, or marriage.

As you enter this quaint shop you are reminded of an ancient cathedral. 
Your eyes trace the grand columns to thier apex in the ceiling.  You notice
the immense stain glass windows whose light cascades down onto the stone
floor before you.  In this delicate dance of colored light, you see tales of
knights of old batteling the forces of darnkess.  By the holy aura you feel
in this room, you know that the shop keeper must be a powerful Cleric or
Paladin, with the power of the Almighty as his guide and protector.

Warren's Study``~
You find yourself entering into a cozy study, cherry wood panneling set withnumerous shelves line the walls. Directly across from you behind a giant cherry wood desk is a large balcony window leading out onto a terrace overlooking the city of Thesden.
Next to the desk sits a small cast iron wood stove, fighting to keep back the drafts which flutter the large tapestries on the outside wall of the aging tower.
Numerous volumes of ancient texts line the walls and are piled on the desk, Warrens pastime. Many times have you seen him studying these texts late into the night.
You look down to notice a worn area of the rug at yout feet, you snicker as you recall the numberous times you have seen young novices standing rigidly at attention on this very spot while thier superior officer "explained" proper behavior.
Looking around you realize why Warren has many times refused to move to a more splendid office, this one although humble, feels like home.

the Town Square, although this home's master takes little comfort in that. 
There is a simple bed in the corner, and a small table in the middle of the

roaring fire that seems to always be burning...

Books take the place of luxury furnishings. There are many arcane volumes

As you climb up the mast of the Ship of Fools, Finn and Knagi greet you 
with a cold glass of ale, and a warm smile. Hmm, your pants seem a little
looser, and your shirt is a bit tighter. And you think Finn is just the
greatest guy in the whole world. And you really, REALLY want to give
all your money to Catriana, who is sitting in the crow's nest staring
out to sea. Look! It's Tritoch, wandering the realms of Exodus far off
in the distance. You know it's Tritoch, cause there is a big explosion,
and Knagi is right next to you.

This establishment clearly caters to the Sidhe of the world. High vaulted ceilings
and lots of wing room between tables allows the efficient wait staff to serve you.
Speaking of the waiting staff, it appears that the entire bar is serviced by ex-Alliant
members enslaved by the Jhereg for the express purpose of making Vro'ath burgers and
Elfshakes! 
You feel strangley compelled not to tip...

`dThe meeting room is pretty big.  Covered with wood paneling, it is very
confortable and warm,  shielding the Knights that sought some rest from
the cold streets of Thesden, specially in winter.  A `bfireplace`d heats
the place, being several confortable couchs around it.  The walls are
decored with `kgolden plaques`d, that display the family shield of arms of
all the Alliant Knights.  A `osilver plaque`d lists all the families that have
fought against evil and sworn the oath of the Holy Alliant Order.

`ja forest glade``~
All of the Folk's ancient wisdom has gone into this room, transforming a
once barren and unliveable house into a beautiful forest glade bursting with
life and color.  Saplings of every description surround a small meadow of
wildflowers.  Birds sing and squirrels and chipmunks play in the trees. 
This small glimpse of the ancient forests that once covered the land makes
you long for the day that all Thesden will be again swallowed in trees.

`eA set of coal black stairs descends into this oddly decorated room.  Dark
wood paneling lines the walls, absorbing light cast from tastefully accented
globes.  A hardwood floor greets the bottom marble step and supports the
remainder of the room.  A doorway leads `heast`e into the Jhereg `hOffice
Foyer`e.  An inviting archway opens to the `hnorth`e where the Jhereg
Library is located.  Darkened passageways stretch to the `hwest`e and the
`hsouth`e.  As you complete your survey of the room you notice a`a Jhereg`e
crafted with intricate scrollwork into the hardwood flooring.  Standing
unobtrusively in the corner is a giant `krat.

`o}`a^`o\`av`o/`a^`{`a   Jhereg`h Embassy``~
`hThe `aJhereg`b Embassy`h takes up a large part of this converted palacial estate.
The light panels over the windows reduce the overall brightness and direct what light
does filter through the windows onto a `as`ht`ay`hl`ai`hz`ae`hd`a Jhereg`a embalzoned on the floor.
The floor itself is made from planks of ancient hardwood trees, presumably from forests
first inhabited by the Sidhe. `h
`h
Along the west wall are portraits of past `aJhereg`h ambassadors to Thesden. Most prominent
among these are masterful representations of `rMorian`h,`b Paarshad`h,`b Erize`h, and `kDepravity.
`hOn the opposite wall is a huge map of the world, with the name Tempest, master cartographer, stamped in the corner.``
`h
A receptionist desk dominates the floor just past the stylized `a Jhereg`h. Beyond that
desk is a doorway leading further into the embassy. Other dark cloaked Sidhe drift around the edges of
the room, watching you carefully. This is clearly `aJhereg`h home 'turf'.

The office of the`a Jhereg`h Ambassador to`b Thesden`h is quite tastefully appointed. 
Prominent among the rooms features is a broad desk with the name plate `eSolaar`h etched
in silver filigree. The desk itself has an emblazoned `aJhereg`h crest in its center.
Directly in front of the desk are two plus `bchairs`h for guests to sit in.
Behind the desk is a black curtain which ruffles slightly with the breeze from the
ventilation ducts cut into the side of the walls. A spiral staircase leading up and down
adorns one corner of the room.
`h
Translucent phantasmic cats seem to lurk along the side walls, behind an assortment
of exotic plants and potted flowers. You get the feeling you're being watched.

As you climb down to the deck, you notice that this ship is anything but
normal. It *looks* like a ship, and it's *shaped* like a ship, but everything
seems out of joint. Jesters scamper about, and a gentle sea breeze puts
you at ease. To the north, you can see a lounge, with other amenities behind
it. To the south, is the ladder to the Crow's Nest, which reaches high into
the sky, allowing it to moor at WeinCloudstan. Funny...there aren't any oceans
in WeinCloudstan...

The Trophy Room``~
Keeping with the fashion of the spartan home, this room has the same
plain oaken walls as the rest of the rooms.  This room difers in the fact it
actually has personality, however.  Scattered about are trophies from
Stryker's many exploits in the many worlds he has traveled through.  You see
a large fang in one corner, a dirty looking oil cloth, a jar labeled SPLEEN,
and a large pile of crumbs in the middle of the room.

cloth~
This lump of ancient oil cloth is all Stryker has of his former peaceful
life.  For the short time he was married, he gave up adventuring and wrapped
his longsword in this very oil cloth.  Now, after an Orcish raid on his
home, he keeps only this as a rememberence of the only peace he had ever
known.  
~
E
fang~
This is the fang from the first dragon that Stryker ever slew.  This
dragon was raiding a small village to the north, and would have surely
perished had the madman not intervened.  This battle marked Stryker's return
to the world of men, and the beginning of his life as a wanderer.  
~

crumbs~
There appears to be a plethora of cookie crumbs and a few chocolate chips
on the floor.  You wonder *WHO* could have been in here, but you certainly
have no earthly idea.  
~
E
spleen~
This jar contains the spleen of Stryker's former rival, Caitiph.  The
spleen is rather small, fitting with the rest of it's former owner.  Caitiph
and Stryker crossed swords many times in many differnet lands and many
different ways, but Caitiph had never won a victory.  This spleen is in
rememberence of those olden days.

in the center of the room is a giant statue of three `iElephants!  `l
Sitting about the statue are various instruments, writting materials, and
pieces of paper holding bits of prose and nonsense.  The walls each hold a
`dv`oo`jr`bt`ee`nx`l of swirling colors, making you loose your balance in
vertigo as you watch.  The far wall is completly clear from this side, and
seems to overlook a `mpurple ocean`l.  The light in the room comes from the
`cc`ee`ii`ll`ii`nn`gg`l, which is yet another vortex of colors.  As you
watch a small `blobster-bird`l flies out of the `mpurple ocean`l, circles
the statue for a moment, then flies into the vortex on the right wall.  You
think you hear a sizzle in the distance.  Then the statues seem to be moving

And the fact that the wolf had a larger penis. She squinted her eyes and
moaned as the enormous lupine cock plunged into her again, intensely
aware of every inch. Yes, at least twice as big. She could no longer
deny the pleasure it was giving her; with each stroke her sex burned like
fire. But it was not just the sheer size of the penis that aroused
Celebrian, nor the steady, powerful, unrelenting thrusts with which the
warg-chieftain rammed it's organ into her. The feelings of fear and
helplessness had merged into a weird sensual thrill, and she gasped
passionately as the grey-furred beast ravaged her like sexual prey, the
wolf using her body to satisfy its lust with the same ferocity that it
might devour a deer to satisfy its hunger.  But still, she fought against
showing it. She struggled to remain still and silent while the tension of
her body wound tighter and tighter. She would not give her orcish captors
the benefit of seeing a lady of the Noldor beg an animal to fuck her
harder. She would not provide them the sight of the wife of Elrond
Halfelven screaming in orgasmic bliss, impaled on a wolf's cock. Cock!
So big... so deep... so... good... no, mustn't!... must stop! so good!
Must fight it!... so.... big...
``
so... "Ohhhhh!!!!!!!!!!!" Celebrian wrapped her legs around the wolf's
hindquarters as she threw back her head and screamed with pleasure.
"Ohh!Oh!Oh!Yes!Oh!Yes!" She ground her crotch against the warg's, trying
to drive the beast's penis deeper into her spasming sex.
"YES!Oh!oh!oh!ooooooooooohhhhhhhhhh!..." Soft murmurings continued to
escape her throat as her climax wound down and she lay there, rolling with
the force of the wolf's thrusts. As she savored those thrusts she became
aware that they were quickening in pace. She also heard a low growl
rising in the wolf's throat. The growling grew louder, and the louder it
got the faster and harder the penis drove in and out of Celebrian's
drenched sex, each time eliciting an appreciative gasp, until the growl
became a fangs-bared snarl, the thrusts became rapid, savage hammer-blows,
and Celebrian's voice rose in a delirious lust-crazed wail punctuated by the
shriller cries of her climaxes. Finally Celebrian felt the cock slide all
the way into her and hold there. A second later she felt it pulse, followed
by the sensation of hot warmth filling her, wolf-semen streaming against the
walls of her womb in forceful spurts. Celebrian's scream announced her
orgasm as she arched her body against her grey-furred captor. Above her the
warg raised its head and howled. The whole pack took up their chief's call
as he reveled in his conquest, asserting his dominance over her with a flood
of semen.
``
The wolf slipped his cock out quickly and slid off of her. Mustering some
of her returning strength, Celebrian sat up and watched as the warg-chief
walked through his pack. The other wolves crowded around him, pushing aside
the others with snarls and barks. Whenever the chief glanced towards one or
the other it fawned on him, as if seeking a favor of some kind. Celebrian
watched, curious. Suddenly the wolf-chief stopped and looked at one of the
larger members of the pack, then uttered a sharp half-bark, half-growl.
The other wolf rubbed appreciatively against the chief and howled, then
turned. The rest of the pack made way as the recipient of the leader's
favor trotted, head and tail held high, towards Celebrian. Her eyes went
wide when she saw the erect penis dangling beneath him and grasped the
implications.
``
"Elbereth, be merciful," she whispered. "There are almost *fifty* of them!"
She slid down off of the wooden platform where the warg-chief had raped her;
his semen trickled out of her pussy and dripped down her legs. Watching the
approach of her new bestial paramour, she sank submissively to a hands and
knees posture. She pushed her ass into the air in invitation, waiting
anxiously. She felt the wolf climb up tp mount her. She tensed, legs spread
slightly, eagerly awaiting the first brutal thrust. The wolf did not
disappoint her. Soon Celebrian's body rocked under the savagely-fucking
beast, her breasts quivering with every stroke. As her orgasm began to
erupt within her, she thought of her expected rescuers, and she whispered
another prayer to Elbereth: "Please, don't let them find me too soon!"
~
E
lotr3~
The wolf leapt up soundlessly; Celbrian gave way before it and tripped on
something, falling backwards before the beast. But instead of hitting the
stone floor she landed on wooden boards. The wolf's forepaws pressed down
on her shoulders while its hind- paws rested on the ground between her feet;
the snout was inches from her face, the white razor-sharp teeth gleaming as
it looked down at her. Was it toying with her? And why had the orcs placed
what felt like a table behind her? For the wolves' "feast"? The wolf turned
his head to one side and barked and snarled to one of his underlings in what
almost sounded like language; he repeated his orders to several other
wolves. Celebrian felt them tugging at her dress, tearing the cloth off
from several directions. She glanced to her left and saw one wolf shredding
the sleeve off of her arm; on her right another was doing the same. Down
between her legs she saw...
``
Her gaze locked on the huge red penis protruding from the warg-chief's
grey-furred sheath. Suddenly realizing what was about to happen, she
struggled to get up, but the wolf bore his weight down on her and bared
his fangs, snarling viciously less than an inch from her face. She did
not dare move as he grabbed the front of her dress in his jaws and tore
it away, exposing her firm breasts. Tauntingly he licked and nuzzled at
them, his wet pink tongue lapping at her nipples and cleavage. She
squirmed, feeling the wolf's hot breath on her neck before he lapped at
her chin, then began licking her face. She started to move her head
aside but stopped when the wolf snarled again. It moved back down to her
breasts, slurping loudly as he washed his tongue all over her nipples.
Celebrian squirmed again, in fear, and in shame, because despite her
terror and disgust she could feel her nipples stiffening from the wolf's
savage foreplay.
``
She felt the last of her dress torn away from her lower body, and also
the wolf fur brushing against the inside of her thighs.
``
She felt the tip of the wolf's penis pressed against the entrance to her
sex, and she knew there was nothing she could do to stop him. The wolf
looked down at her, staring straight into her eyes as he drove his
enormous cock into her with a single powerful thrust. Celebrian gasped in
spite of herself. So big! It felt so... so... "No!" she told herself. "It's
horrible! I'm being raped by an animal, a wolf... evil! I must fight it,
must..." She gasped again as the wolf began pumping his cock in and out of
her, and she struggled not to acknowledge the pleasure it was giving her.
She tried to ignore the exquisite pain of the wolf's penis stretching her
with each thrust, the tickling of the fur rubbing the inside of her legs,
the sticky wetness spreading around her sex, the rough wet tongue licking
at her rigid nipples. She could feel her climax building inside her, and
each time the wolf's cock slid in and out of her sopping pussy it pushed
her closer. Her mind recoiled from the idea of being brought to orgasm by
an animal -- worse, a servant of darkness -- but her body did not care.
She tried to block it out by thinking of her husband -- surely he must be
on his way to rescue her! But then all she could think of was what would
Elrond think when he saw her lying there being taken by a wolf.

Above her the goblin-king groaned, obviously enjoying her attentions.
Celebrian felt his claws dig into her scalp as he grabbed her head and
started to force it downwards. The glans drove into her mouth, and the orc
pressed her head down further, burying her nose in his smelly pubic hair and
ramming his cock down her throat. She reached down between his legs and
craddled his balls in her delicate hand while inside her mouth her tongue
washed all around the shaft of his penis. She began to bob her head, her
lips pressed tightly around the orc shaft sliding between them. Her sucking
grew more insistent as the penis moved in and out of her mouth. The orc's
fingers tangled in her hair; from the ragged sounds of his breath Celebrian
realized that he was nearing climax; the tears streamed from her eyes as
she considered the loathsome prospect of the brutish goblin ejaculating
into her mouth. She tried even harder to pull away, but to no avail. She
continued sucking, sucking, sucking...
``
The goblin-king threw back his head and growled, and his penis jerked in her
mouth as his seed squirted out.  It was thick and warm, with a bitter, salty
taste; Celebrian felt it wash over her tongue and fill her mouth before she
swallowed, gulping down the vile stuff. More orc-semen flooded in. She tried
to spit it out, but instead she drank it down like it was miruvor. Suddenly,
she felt her head pushed back from the still-spasming cock. It hovered in
front of her for just a moment, staring like a one-eyed serpent. Then it
jerked again and cum splattered against her face, striking her in the chin.
More semen, white with tinges of yellow and green, sprayed her cheek and
lips.
``
Slowly the flow abated, until it was just a lazy dribble of sperm trickling
onto the stone tiles. Still unable to control herself, she extended her
tongue to catch the falling drops. She took the softening penis her mouth
and cleaned off the last of the semen, meanwhile fearing that she would
never be rid of the taste of the stuff. She leaned over and spat out some
of it. Realizing that somehow she now had control of herself she spat again
and again, wiping the slimy cum from her face with the back of her hand.
``
The king laughed again, and his assembled followers did likewise. "Can't
quite make up her mind, can she?" Celebrian looked up at him, trembling
and sobbing. "What are you going to do to me?" "I'll let you find out for
yourself," he answered. The goblin- king turned towards one of the more
fearsome orcs near his throne. "Uzgash! Bring the wargs!"
``
``                              -= "The Wargs" =-
``                         ,.-`.,,.-`
``
A sharp pang of fear shot through Celebrian at the mention of the evil wargs,
wolves of great size, intelligence, and malice. No doubt the orcs intended to
watch her torn apart by the savage beasts. But a small part of her felt
relief that it would soon be over; after what she had just been through,
death seemed an almost pleasant prospect. She did not resist when the guards
pulled her towards the center of the cave. She felt the cold metal of a shackle
clamped around her ankle. She moved her leg; looking down, she saw that she was
chained to an iron spike driven into the rock. Then the guards withdrew, look
fearfully at something behind her. She turned, slowly, following their gaze.
``
There were at least four dozen wargs, each the size of a pony, stalking
towards her out of the mouth of one of the tunnels. The beasts walked with a
slow, easy grace, glancing from time to time at the orcs, but mostly eying her
hungrily. At the head of the pack, leading them, walked one larger than the
rest, a grey-furred wolf with an aura of majestic evil. Celebrian heard the
sound of something being set down behind her, but kept her eyes on the
advancing wargs.  The wolf-chieftain stopped just in front of her, examining
her with glinting amber eyes. He licked his chops, and it seemed almost that
he was grinning.  Then his body tensed as he prepared to spring. She breathed
a whispered prayer to Elbereth that he would be quick.

The raucous shouts of hundreds of orcs echoed through the rough-hewn cavern as
the guards hauled Celebrain across the floor towards the throne. At the foot
of the dais she tripped on shreds of green cloth that were the remnants of
her dress. Cursing, one of the uruks grabbed a handful of her silver tresses,
dragged her up the steps, and dropped her painfully to the ground.
``
"Well, what have we here," growled a voice above her. Celebrian tried to
muster up the strength to speak, but before she could do so one of the
guards spoke up.
``
"We snared this elf-bitch traveling through our pass, o truly tremendous one,"
he replied. "There were ten others with her, but we did for 'em, the filth."
``
"Hmmmmm... good work, Bagdush. So, slut, what do you have to say for yourself?
Speak up!" The guard twisted Celebrian's arm behind her and used the leverage
to force her up onto her knees. Her vision filled with the sight of a large,
muscular orc staring down at her from the throne, a jagged iron crown on his
head.
``
"I am Celebrian, wife of Elrond of Rivendell," she replied, trying to sound
imperious and confident, "and he will deal harshly with you if I am harmed."
``
"Har! Har! Harharhar!" The goblin king raised his gruff voice for the hearing
of his assembled court. "You hear that, boys? Aren't we scared? Aren't we
quakin' in our boots?" The orcs roared with laughter. "Well, since we don't
want to get in trouble with.. Lord Elrond," he said with mock reverence, "I
suppose we'd better be nice to his dear lady." He glanced over at one of the
guards and nodded meaningfully; the guard scurried off.  "Yep, we'd better
treat her real affectionate-like." The goblin king reached around his waist
and loosened the furs wrapped around him. Then he fished out his erection.
Celebrian's eyes widened in terror and disgust as she viewed the thing; it
easily measured a foot long, thick as a spear, its brownish-green skin
dotted here and there with hairy warts. The king hefted it proudly, leering
down at his captive. "I'll bet yer husband aint' got one this big. Bet
you're dyin' for a taste of it." It took Celebrian a moment to realize what
he was referring to. She shook her head, trying to back away.
``
"No, please, not that!" She had never dabbled in what was commonly called
"the Elvish Art," and the prospect of taking an orc's penis into her
mouth horrified her.
``
The goblin king laughed again. "Eh? Too bad, I've heard lots o' stories
'bout how talented you elf girls are." The guard who had left a minute or
so ago returned, bearing a flask gingerly. He handed it to the king, who
rolled it idly in his free hand. Letting go of his penis he unstoppered
it and gestured to the guards. "Bring her forward!"
``
Celebrian struggled as the guards pushed her into a kneeling position at
the very foot of the throne. He nodded, and one of the guards pried her
mouth open. Then she felt the flask forced past her teeth, and a burning,
sour liquid poured into her mouth. The flask was removed, and the guards
pinched her nose and held her mouth shut to force her to swallow. When
she did they dropped her to the floor again. She felt a sensation like
fire coursing through her limbs. Her mouth was dry, but she felt dampness
growing between her legs. Trembling, she pushed herself up with her hands.
"What have you done to me?" she gasped, looking up at the orc.
``
"The shamans call it 'dragon piss', 'cause it puts bitches into heat,"
replied the king, grinning. "Makes 'em real fun to be with, makes 'em do
all sorts of things they wouldn't do before." Against her will Celebrian's
eyes were drawn to the orc's erection, and she stifled an urge to lick her
lips.
``
"No, please, make it stop!" she pleaded. "Don't make me.. don't.."
``
The orc guffawed. "Hey, I'm not doin' anything. You can do whatever you want
to." Fighting herself and losing, she moved her head towards the orc's lap,
saliva drooling out of her open mouth. Tears ran hot down her cheeks as she
thought of Elrond and how she was about to pleasure an orc in a way that she
had never done for her husband. She tried to close her eyes, but they remained
stubbornly open as her tongue flicked out to lick the tip of the orc's penis.
The rank orc smell filled her nostrils as she pressed her lips against his
glans and began to work the huge, scabby thing into her mouth.

Once we looked at the pavement and found the blocks loose and displaced by
grass, with scarce a line of rusted metal to shew where the tramways had run.
And again we saw a tram-car, lone, windowless, dilapidated, and almost on its
side. When we gazed around the horizon, we could not find the third tower by the
river, and noticed that the silhouette of the second tower was ragged at the
top. Then we split up into narrow columns, each of which seemed drawn in a
different direction. One disappeared in a narrow alley to the left, leaving only
the echo of a shocking moan. Another filed down a weed-choked subway entrance,
howling with a laughter that was mad. My own column was sucked toward the open
country, and presently I felt a chill which was not of the hot autumn; for as we
stalked out on the dark moor, we beheld around us the hellish moon-glitter of
evil snows. Trackless, inexplicable snows, swept asunder in one direction only,
where lay a gulf all the blacker for its glittering walls. The column seemed
very thin indeed as it plodded dreamily into the gulf. I lingered behind, for
the black rift in the green-litten snow was frightful, and I thought I had
heard the reverberations of a disquieting wail as my companions vanished, but
my power to linger was slight. As if beckoned by those who had gone before, I
half-floated between the titanic snowdrifts, quivering and afraid, into the
sightless vortex of the unimaginable.
Screamingly sentient, dumbly delirious, only the gods that were can tell. A
sickened, sensitive shadow writhing in hands that are not hands, and whirled
blindly past ghastly midnights of rotting creation, corpses of dead worlds with
sores that were cities, charnel winds that brush the pallid stars and make them
flicker low. Beyond the worlds vague ghosts of monstrous things, half-seen
columns of unsanctifled temples that rest on nameless rocks beneath space and
reach up to dizzy vacua above the spheres of light and darkness. And through
this revolting graveyard of the universe the muffled, maddening beating of
drums, and thin, monotonous whine of blasphemous flutes from inconceivable,
unlighted chambers beyond Time, the detestable pounding and piping whereunto
dance slowly, awkwardly, and absurdly the gigantic, tenebrous ultimate godsthe
blind, voiceless, mindless gargoyles whose soul is Nyarlathotep.
~
E
nyarl1~
Nyarlathotep... the crawling chaos... I am the last... I will tell the audient
void...
I do not recall distinctly when it began, but it was months ago. The general
tension was horrible. To a season of political and social upheaval was added a
strange and brooding apprehension of hideous physical danger; a danger
widespread and all-embracing, such a danger as may be imagined only in the most
terrible phantasms of the night. I recall that the people went about with pale
and worried faces, and whispered warnings and prophecies which no one dared
consciously repeat or acknowledge to himself that he had heard. A sense of
monstrous guilt was upon the land, and out of the abysses between the stars
swept chill currents that made men shiver in dark and lonely places. There was a
demoniac alteration in the sequence of the seasonsthe autumn heat lingered
fearsomely, and everyone felt that the world and perhaps the universe had passed
from the control of known gods or forces to that of gods or forces which were
unknown.
And it was then that Nyarlathotep came out of Egypt. Who he was, none could
tell, but he was of the old native blood and looked like a Pharaoh. The fellahin
knelt when they saw him, yet could not say why. He said he had risen up out of
the blackness of twenty-seven centuries, and that he had heard messages from
places not on this planet. Into the lands of civilisation came Nyarlathotep,
swarthy, slender, and sinister, always buying strange instruments of glass and
metal and combining them into instruments yet stranger. He spoke much of the
sciencesof electricity and psychologyand gave exhibitions of power which sent
his spectators away speechless, yet which swelled his fame to exceeding
magnitude. Men advised one another to see Nyarlathotep, and shuddered. And where
Nyarlathotep went, rest vanished, for the small hours were rent with the screams
of nightmare. Never before had the screams of nightmare been such a public
problem; now the wise men almost wished they could forbid sleep in the small
hours, that the shrieks of cities might less horribly disturb the pale, pitying
moon as it glimmered on green waters gliding under bridges, and old steeples
crumbling against a sickly sky.
I remember when Nyarlathotep came to my citythe great, the old, the terrible
city of unnumbered crimes. My friend had told me of him, and of the impelling
fascination and allurement of his revelations, and I burned with eagerness to
explore his uttermost mysteries. My friend said they were horrible and
impressive beyond my most fevered imaginings; and what was thrown on a screen in
the darkened room prophesied things none but Nyarlathotep dared prophesy, and in
the sputter of his sparks there was taken from men that which had never been
taken before yet which shewed only in the eyes. And I heard it hinted abroad
that those who knew Nyarlathotep looked on sights which others saw not.
It was in the hot autumn that I went through the night with the restless crowds
to see Nyarlathotep; through the stifling night and up the endless stairs into
the choking room. And shadowed on a screen, I saw hooded forms amidst ruins, and
yellow evil faces peering from behind fallen monuments. And I saw the world
battling against blackness; against the waves of destruction from ultimate
space; whirling, churning, struggling around the dimming, cooling sun. Then the
sparks played amazingly around the heads of the spectators, and hair stood up on
end whilst shadows more grotesque than I can tell came out and squatted on the
heads. And when I, who was colder and more scientific than the rest, mumbled a
trembling protest about imposture and static electricity, Nyarlathotep drove
us all out, down the dizzy stairs into the damp, hot, deserted midnight streets.
I screamed aloud that I was not afraid; that I never could be afraid; and others
screamed with me for solace. We swore to one another that the city was exactly
the same, and still alive; and when the electric lights began to fade we cursed
the company over and over again, and laughed at the queer faces we made.
I believe we felt something coming down from the greenish moon, for when we

When age fell upon the world, and wonder went out of the minds of men; when grey
cities reared to smoky skies tall towers grim and ugly, in whose shadow none
might dream of the sun or of Spring's flowering meads; when learning stripped
the Earth of her mantle of beauty and poets asang no more of twisted phantoms
seen with bleared and inward looking eyes; when these things had come to pass,
and childish hopes had gone forever, there was a man who traveled out of life on
a quest into spaces whither the worlds dreams had fled.
Of the name and abode of this man little is written, for they were of the waking
world only; yet it is said that both were obscure. It is enough to say that he
dwelt in a city of high walls where sterile twilight reigned, that he toiled all
day among shadow and turmoil, coming home at evening to a room whose one window
opened not to open fields and groves but on to a dim court where other windows
stared in dull dispair. From that casement one might see only walls and windows,
except sometimes when one leaned so far out and peered at the small stars that
passed. And because mere walls and windows must soon drive a man to madness who
dreams and reads much, the dweller in that room used night after night to lean
out and peer aloft to glimpse some fragment of things beyond the waking world
and the tall cities. After years he began to call the slow sailing stars by
name, and to follow them in fancy when they glided regretfully out of sight;
till at length his vision opened to many secret vistas whose existance no common
eye suspected. And one night a mighty gulf was bridged, and the dream haunted
skies swelled down to the lonely watcher's window to merge with the close air of
his room and to make him a part of their fabulous wonder.
There came to that room wild streams of violet midnight glittering with dust of
gold, vortices of dust and fire, swirling out of the ultimate spaces and heavy
perfumes from beyond the worlds. Opiate oceans poured there, litten by suns that
the eye may never behold and having in their whirlpools strange dolphins and
sea-nymphs of unrememberable depths. Noiseless infinity eddied aroud the dreamer
and wafted him away without touching the body that leaned stiffly from the
lonely window; and for days not counted in men's calanders the tides of far
spheres that bore him gently to join the course of other cycles that tenderly
left him sleeping on a green sunrise shore, a green shore fragrant with lotus
blossums and starred by red camalates...

`o}`a^`o\`av`o/`a^`o{`a   Jhereg`h Office Foyer````~
`eSmooth mahogany paneled walls are accented by tasteful artwork and
tactful lighting.  A lone desk stands in the middle of the room, flanked by
a tall plant and a small end-table.  Emblazoned in the carpet is a
`hS`at`hy`al`hi`az`he`ad Jhereg`e.  The final thing which catches your attention is a
`erecessed niche in the wall, peering closer you see that it holds...
`kTARANT!`e   or at least a`h statue`e of him.``

statue~
The detail and workmanship of the piece are incredible!  Your first
impression is that Morian probably looted this from a temple, until you
notice heavy bolts around the corners of statue, fastening it to the floor,
as well as a faint aura shimmering around the niche itself.  Upon closer
examination you notice the eys appear particularly life-like.  In fact, you
kind of get the feeling Tarant is watching you now.  As you turn away from
the statue your last thoughts wander to why such an object would be in the
Jhereg clan hall of all places.

You can tell that this room was once decorated in a highly refined

warriors, summoning helpless enemies to their death, rising to the
leadership of her clan, losing leadership of the clan and finally being

`o}`a^`o\`av`o/`a^`o{   `aMorian's`o Audience Room``~
Five years of dust cover the floor.  Cobwebs hang down from what was once
a tastefully appointed set of furniture, which at one time nicelay matched
the outter foyer.  You notice weapons littered across the desks, chairs, and
tables all covered with a fine, black layer of dust that has settled from
the exposed rock ceiling.  One thing catches your eye, however, as you turn
to leave.  A set of footprints mark the floor coming straight out of the
northern wall.  They stop at the high-backed chair which sits behind the
broad, oak desk.  The chair is clean ...  Recently wiped free of dust and
debris.....  Somehow, you know that Morian has returned.

LadyWinter's Guest Room~
The shades are down and the room is lit only by one candle, but you can
see that the room is very untidy.  The bed is unmade and the top of the
dresser is covered with a jumble of small phials, powder boxes, perfumes,
empty glasses and wine bottles.  Powder has spilled on the floor and items
of flimsy clothing are scattered on the carpet and flung over the bedposts. 
The smell of curry fills the air, and Indian cookbooks are stacked in a corner. 
On a small dresser next to the bed is a picture of LadyWinter's two favorite
Sidhe, Morian and Paarshad.  The `hpicture`e beckons closer inspection.

A beautiful picture of LadyWinter's two favorite Sidhe, Morian and 
Paarshad sits here on a nightstand.  The two stand smiling in front of the
Thesden Jail.  Hmm, although the background of the picture is out of focus 
it appears that plumes of smoke are pouring from the windows.  You can also
make out the faint details of a pile of doors resting off to the side. 
Strange...

You are in a small alcove away from the current of the ocean.  Small eddies
of water swirl gently in circles, stirring the white sands ever so slightly.
The waves high above you cast shadows on the group as the sun shines down into
this little garden of kelp and coral.  Small fish dart to and fro among the
swaying flora that coves the seabed.

`b::`k?`c::`k Fool's Consortium of Intellectual Geniuses `b::`k?`c::````~
When Fools plan to do something foolish this is the place to find them.
This room is filled with the aroma of cheese & ale.  In the center of
the room there is a huge round table made of Limberger Cheese surrounded
by a set of stools.  On the table there are carvings of graffitti, one in
particular is very explicit on showing Finn with a stick up his ass.
Above the graffitti on a coaster is Shandril's magical mug of everlasting ale...

The Black Palace``~
A strange red light from a dragon skull casts eerie shadows throughout this room.
Sparsely furnished and forbidding you find yourself relaxing ... maybe it is the simplicity of it all.
A single painting adorns the walls here depicting a twin masted schooner in heavy seas.
You have entered the private domain of Cyd the Black.

In shades of blue, green and grey this painting shows the twin masted schooner "Hazr"
The seas are violent and the Hazr is listing badly to starboard. Spray covers her decking.
If you look closely you can see a sailor high on one of the masts trying to cut free a ripped mainsail.
You shiver at the thought of being on the boat as it looks surely doomed.

poem~
`jT`che `jS`colitary `jR`ceaper
`c     by William Wordsworth
`d
`jB`cehold her, single in the field,
Yon solitary Highland Lass!
Reaping and singing by herself;
Stop here, or gently pass!
Alone she cuts, and binds the grain,
And sings a melancholy strain;
O listen! for the Vale profound
Is overflowing with the sound.
`j
`jN`co Nightingale did ever chaunt
So sweetly to reposing bands
Of Travellers in some shady haunt,
Among Arabian Sands:
No sweeter voice was ever heard
In spring-time from the Cuckoo-bird,
Breaking the silence of the seas
Among the farthest Hebrides.
`j
`jW`cill no one tell me what she sings?
Perhaps the plaintive numbers flow
For old, unhappy, far-off things,
And battles long ago:
Or is it some more humble lay,
Familiar matter of today?
Some natural sorrow, loss, or pain,
That has been, and may be again!
`j
`jW`chate'er the theme, the Maiden sang
As if her song could have no ending;
I saw her singing at her work,
And o'er the sickle bending;
I listened till I had my fill:
And, as I mounted up the hill,
`jT`che `jm`cusic in my `jh`ceart I `jb`core,
`jL`cong `ja`cfter it was `jh`ceard no `jm`core.

music~
Music has a strong presence inside these underground walls.  Where the
music is coming from is a mystery.  The notes seem to take on a life of
their own, bouncing and echoing between these thick, stone walls.  They mix
together at times, creating a smooth, relaxing sound.  And at other times,
they ring out singly, twanging and weaving through the air, like a
frightening ghoul who comes to rob you of your soul.

This room is enclosed in shadows, only half lit candles light the room. 
The overwhelming stench of death knocks you down immediately and you feel
very uncomfortable here!  You see no one here...  Or so you think!  On all
four walls various weapons of Naslander's and Lighstbane's choice
are in racks still covered with blood and intestines from battles won!  You
see a black leather coach and a bar stool that look quite comfotable but you
dare not sit down for fear of what lingers with you!  You suddenly feel a
shiver down your back as you feel someone edging closer too you.....

`a-< `jHall of The Dragon `a>-``~
`cAs you walk into the center of the encampment, you stand in utter awe
as you notice the intricate carvings on the ceiling, and the elegant
tapestries hanging from the walls.  Past hero's of the clan and dipictions
of past history of the clan are shown in this artwork.  Scanning over the
ceiling a glitter catches your eye, you glance upon the giant crystal
chandelear hanging from the center of the ceiling.  You hear the sound of
flowing water, you change your gaze from the marvelous chandelear to a large
fountain shaped like a leaping dragon in the center of the room.  This
fountain has been carved from the purest jade.  To the north and south lays
Black Fang tunnel.

The Room of Tranquility``~
As you enter the room, a cool breeze washes over you.  You feel the
strange tingle of magic in the air.  You examine the room closely, and
notice a strange orb floating in the center of the room.  The orb is black
in color, and seems to be suspended in its place.  You feel very relaxed and
peaceful in this room.  The sounds of water draw your attension to the
corner of the room, where a small waterfall is glowing with a magical aura. 
This waterfall is very strange.  You can't seem to find where the source of
the water is.  It apears to be falling from knowhere into a small pool on
the ground...

The Living Room``~
Wiping the water off your face, you continue to venture into the large
mansion, entering the living room.  It is rumored that Grandpa Harris once
had the king of Thesden himself over, where they lounged in this very room
and discussed politics and satan.  The carpeting and furniture looks as if
it might have been replaced since that time.  You feel a warm draft as the
climate control system turns on.

south to the starboard side of the ship (the ship is pointed west, for all you
land-lubbers) where it opens up to the main `bdeck`h.  The ship is built for speed
and power, although the `bflag`h it flies is not that of the naval academy of
Freeport.  Perhaps this ship is no longer under the direction of the navy, but
rather in the hands of pirates.  As unscrupulous as the locals look, you notice
that they all steer clear of this ship, for respect or perhaps fear of its
owner.

peering out of the darkness.  Writting in calligraphy across the top of the
box are the words `hTomb Raider.  `e As you turn away from the altar the
light seems to catch the front surface of the stone and, very briefly, you
think you see the letters `hAFK`e flash by.

items. Behind the cabinets stainless steel lines the walls, protecting 
room from corrosion and forceful entry.

`a' You find yourself in a dimly lit hall, filled with the uniform
chanting of countless Vro'ath voices.  As your eyes adjust, you find
yourself in a gigantic Hall, made of polished black granite.  `aThroughout
this massive enclosure are a series of intricatly carved pillers, stretching
endlesslyinto the inky black heights of the hall, to high for the light of
the flickaring torches to illuminate.  Each pillar is intricatly carved with
archaic runes and symbols, every pillar with its own prophecy or legend. 
Other then the pillars, the only furnishings of this hall are hundreds upon
hundreds of Vro'ath warriors, each chanting his own war song, though it
seems to blend into one eerie rumble.

This is where Shandril brews her famous ale and other assorted drinks. 
Along the walls there are shelves full of old wine, beer, and so on.  Theres
not much room in here with all the machines taking up the space.  Might as
well leave, or choke on the stale air that fills the room.

`cGreen`dWood `gHallway``~
`cThe hallway continues up and down the tree. You see pictures etched into the
`cwalls around you. There there is a rose carved in the doors of this hallway.
`cYou can feel a slight breeze flow through a small opening in one of the walls.
A baby `bPhoenix`c is resting in a nest in the wall. It generates light for
this hallway. Above the nest is the `dSeal of Honor`c which names those who
have distinguished themselves. Many names of forgotten people are listed, and
many more of those who have given their lives for the honor of `cGreen`dWood`c.
You hope that perhaps your name will be honored on this seal.

A Beachfront Escape``~
`dDried bamboo stalks have been tightly strapped together to form the 
sturdy walls of this tree-house while still allowing a soft sea breeze in
through the small gaps between them.  Suspended from the thatched roof hangs
a large comfortable hammock for two, which faces the window overlooking the
ocean and beach below.  Huge overstuffed pillows have been placed around the
room for comfortable lounging and an assortment of exotic musical
instruments and decorative tiki masks have been hung from the walls.

As you climb down the winding staircase you notice a faint blue aura

distinct objects can be seen, but random colors appear from every direction.  The air
in this room makes you feel as though you are falling, yet you aren't.  Although the
room itself confuses you greatly, it is said one can come in here and all that they
are confused about will make sense.  That may be just a rumor, though...

`dA wide hallway leads off to the west.  Dim lights make it possible to
observe the surroundings.  `bBlood--red carpeting `dis stretched out on the
ground.  The ceiling is arched in an unfamiliar style.  The panels on the
walls are made from the finest oak, stained a rich brownish color.  It is
`dnoticeably quiet, the noise of the city street unable to reach this part``
`dof the underground world of `bDrow City`d. The only sound that can be heard is``

`dAn Underground Hallway````~
`dThe hallway ends here just as abruptly as it started. A faint sound of
music can be heard coming from somewhere nearby.  There appears to be no
passageways leading anywhere but east, whence you came.  The only object
worthy of examination in this room is an enormous `fportrait `dof a beautiful
human on the western wall. A small glittering `fplaque `dis positioned just
beneath the painting.

portrait~
Obviously great beauty was the inspiration for this painting, for every
brush stroke compliments the others brilliantly.  The style of the painter
brings to life the grace and passion of the object of the masterpiece.  Upon
the canvas stands a slender human being with long flowing hair which blows
freely in the wind.  Bright blue pants fit comfortably over his legs.  His
chest is covered by a slick dragon hide.  His eyes are half-closed, but
light seems to shine from under his thin eyelashes.

`aA Floating Foyer````~
`aOddly, a simple steel plank connects the hallway to a strange expansive
foyer with a transparent floor.  A magical barrier separates this room from
a black, endless pit below.  The music is more prominent, but still its
source remains unknown.  It seems to be coming from all directions. 
Darkness looms over this room.  Only the humming sheet of glass below your
feet is here to reflect the soft light which shines forth from three
floating doors.

`hBaelon's  `lSoul `gComplex``~
As you look around you, you are overwhelmed with the sheer beauty of the place. Strange moving tapestries adorn the walls, and as you look closely at them they seem to be showing various parts of the world. You pull your
gaze from them, you notice the beautiful golden globes of pure sunlight that illuminate the room. They are like nothing you have ever seen, and you find yourself at a loss to describe them. The whole room seems to radiate 
some kind of harmony, and it seems the whole room is attuned to nature somehow, with all things seeming to honour this place. Light crackles from some parts of the room, and you get the feeling that this place in not quite

see the second floor of this grand home. Pictures of Harris' friends line

Felicia, and a very large picture of Ladywinter sits high above the rest.
You chuckle as you look at a picture of Morian and Paarshad, the evil duo.
You almost trip as you see a picture of Thyriz, the coolest mob in the land.

Cinder Patio``~
This patio is molded from the ashen remains of a now dormant volcano. It is
flat and smooth and cool to the touch with cracks marbling through its grey
surface. The patio is very large with arching paths on either side leading
off to the mansion ahead.

The patio comes to an end here, and three steps lead to an enormous steel
door directly in front of you. A prominent brass knocker hangs from the
sound door about eye level in front of you. You can make out a small

A Dirt Path``~
You leave the hidden tunnel, to find a long dirt path ahead of you. Beyond
some brush you see a small pond to the south. The heat seems to amplify greatly
here as the dust floats up from beneath your shoes. The pond ahead begins
to look much more inviting.

`eA Beautiful Pond````~
You stand at the edge of a sandy beach, looking onward at the calm, quiet pond.
Ducks paddle around aimlessly, stopping every once in awhile to snatch
a fish for food. Large mountains engulfed in thick trees prevent you from
passing the pond and venturing further.

`pIt is dim inside, but not dark.  The floor, which used to be bare wood with the 
previous owner, has been covered in a rich wall-to-wall carpeting the color of burgandy
white.  The walls have been painted an egg-shell white.  A thin light, as white as the
walls, filters in through the soaped display window.  There are half a dozen items in
display cases, and the spotlights are trained on them, but `gyou `pcan't tell what they 
are.  "`kHello?`p" `gyou `pask uncertainly, still standing in the doorway.  "`kIs anybody

You enter into a small room, cluttered with shelves and boxes.  Unlike
most rooms you have seen in this Citadel, this one is brightly lit, allowing
you to take in your surroundings.  And from what you take in, you can tell
that the Vro'ath that dwells in this Citadel is a serious collector of
anything he can get his hands on.  The boxes contain everything from the
most valuable Gems on the continent, to rusty old helmets and gauntlet s.

Fumes can be seen comming from an old smelly bathroom to the north and the
the east in the boss' office with a glass window looking over the whole
operation.

NOBASH - original - The Foyer~
`h Welcome to the house of Isis and Ziggy!  `h `h Standing here in the
main hallway you gawk in awe at the amazing `hfeat of dwarven engineering
involved in building just such a hall.  `hDominating the arched ceiling is a
massize `kcrystal`h shining `ha brillaint white light into the hall.  The
vaulted ceiling arches up `htowards a mid-ponit where a solid silver symbol
of `nMOTA `hhas been `hinserted as a `kkeystone`h to hold the other stones
in place.  The `hstones used in the walls and cieling's construction are
made of shale.  `hbut the floor is an ebony like material with a
silvery-white metal `hrippled throughout its surface.  The hall is spartan
other than a `ktable `hhere against the wall and a `kwelcome mat`h on the
floor `hin front of a solid shale door.  An archway leads to the west and
stairs `hlead upwards to a wooden door.

***SHAYNA'S PLACE***``~
As you first walk into this room you find yourself laughin with all the warrior
equipment, fine silken dresses and ladies unmentionables strewn all about.  On the
west wall is an unmade well slept in bed.  Along the north and east walls are
benches with tools gadgets and thingamajigs you dont even dare ask for what
purpose they are used.  You suddenly are awe struck by the aura illuminating to
your left.  You suddenly notice a small cross pulsating above this ladies bed.  You
soon realize what this fine lady is all about.

Upon entering this room, you sense a strange power emitting from
the walls themselves!  Looking around, you see shards of blue crystals
embedded in the walls.  You don't know what kind of crystals they
are but they glow an eerie purplish blue, and they feel cool and
refreshing to the touch.  Several beds lined the walls for the sick and
injured.

This is it, the giant exodusian pie.  Made up of the artistic creations
of bards and others throughout the realm, the aroma reflects the current
level of civilization in Exodus.  Right now it smells a little funny, but
not as bad as the year old jerky you ate before coming here.  You had best
not take a bite, as tempted as you may be.  Musical symbols have been known
to cause death or worse when taken literally.

There are post scatered all over the place and the room smells mostly of `kc`jh`ke`je`ks`je``.
You realize that this room IS a crock of `kC`jh`ke`je`ks`je`` and you wonder why?

This simple room, for a short time used as a divergent outpost, is
mainly remembered as the entrance to Revolution's clan hall.  Once Revolution
was destroyed by the gods, as divergent had been, it was converted over to
a Jhereg clan hall to provide a comforting place for the few Revolutionaries
remaining in the realm, who had chosen to see refuge in Jhereg.
Now that these few remaining ex-Revolutionaries have realized
Jhereg is a piece of shit, the rooms have been converted into a 
use for all, hopefully to be kept up in case these ex-Revolutionaries
decide the realm is worth coming back to.

`cA Forested Room``~
This room has recently been overhauled to make you feel like you're in the forest.
Two small trees "grow" in the eastern part of the room, while several stumps lie
to the west.  Leaves cover the floor so densely that running, jumping, and landing
on the floor would not hurt a bit.  Someone must have spent a fortune creating such 
a room, but its beauty is well worth it.

All around you are Jhereg members being tortured.  It's not like
it was very hard to capture them.  You poke them with a feather
and they scream like little orcish concubines.  To the left is
a machine that stretches them apart.  Those are some TALL sidhe
over there, though once they get too tall they are tossed in
the pile of corpses to the right.  In the north end of the room
lies a giant vice.  Jhereg member's head's are held there and the
vice turned, until their puny little brains pop out their eye
socket, and then their bodies are put on display at Devon
Square Center, for all kind to laugh at.

them, a 9 year old girl is caught in mid air by the painter.  Other then them, the group consists of teenagers about 16 years old.  The third from the right looks just Crissy, only younger.  Words that were written
on the upper left hand corner read;
 
"`qThe Martyr's Blade, `tmay they live in peace and prosperity from this point on`k".

`dA room within the `cr`oo`co`ot`cs `dof an oak````~
`dYour standing within a mildly spacious room that seems to have been built out from
underneath the `cr`do`oo`dt`cs `dof a gigantic oak. Huge, tendril like roots snake down from the
ceiling down into the ground beneath your feet, acting as a support for the imposing
weight of the earth above. Even though this cave like structure is deep under the ground,
the soft lighting from the `bg`il`ko`bw`ki`in`bg `bb`ira`kzi`ier`bs `dand w`ki`ock`ke`dr l`ka`om`kp`ds hanging from some of the
roots give it a soft, almost comforting sort of presence. The ground seems to have been
patted or pressed down long ago, giving it a hard, almost clay like substance, making it
relatively free of  actual loose dirt. There is a bookshelf built into the wall on the far side
of the cave, its many shelves spilling over with books and journals from the occupants
journeys and travels. There is a statue of a man on the opposite wall of the bookshelf. He
stands tall and firm, being made out of carved wood. Resting in his hands is a large bowl
where `om`hil`ok `drests, constantly `nf`gr`oe`gs`nh `dand `nc`goo`nl`d. To the left of the statue sits a several very
large `bcu`is`ohi`io`bns `dthat look very fluffy and soft, they seem to have several nicely cured h`ai`dd`ae`ds
draped across them -- the tough, but extremely soft for of a m`aou`dnt`aai`dn b`aea`dr cub from the

move away from the doorway and look around more.  There is a large desk in
the corner strewn with diffrent documents of diffrent importance.  A lantern
burns on the corner of the cherrywood desk.  `lYou look at the wall north of
you and see a large painting dominates.  It if of a beautiful silver dragon
flying through the sky.  `lBelow is an inscription stating `wNakira a loyal
companion`` `lThere is a comfortable looking couch sitting against another
wall.  `lYou notice a beautiful hand woven rug covering hard wood floors. 
You can usually find Lisara here doing paperwork or reading a book.

You see the cathedral and the towns square. As you watch you see people scurrying hurridly back and forth on the roads 
You feel as though you can see forever from here. This view makes you feel that you have no worries. You feel a sense and need to pray here. Pray for the happiness and safety of this buetiful city.
You could stand there forever just watching but with a sigh you turn from the mesmerizing view...

Morghiel's tent.``~
This is Morghiel's personal tent where he goes to rest
and relax away from clan business and spend time with
his harem.  The furnishings are simple yet comfortable.
The walls of the tent do much to muffle sounds from
outside and keep the inside of the tent warm and dry.
A large, comfortable looking pile of pillow surrounded
by a thin veil takes up about half of the room.

`cGreen`dWood `gMeeting Room``~
`cAs you enter this octagonal room, you notice the deep darkness and the faint
`chint of beeswax and roses. Removing your boots and socks, you merge with the
`cnight around you and let your eyes adjust. Soon, you become aware of pools
`cof light- some steady, and some shimmering in the breeze,but all serving to 
`caccentuate the gloom. the floor is a marvel of devotion to wood, consisting
`cof a thin sheet of rosewood brought still alive from the jungles of the City
`cof the Sun and polished with fine beach sand, anointed with rare oils, then
`ccoated with beeswax and polished to a silken finish. The wavering lights are
`clumiaries made of parchment paper rubbed with gold leaf and bent to cup
`cmagical candles that never burn low. The steady illumination 12 feet above
`cyou comes from 8 alabaster spheres that were magically hollowed out and
`clinked with platinum chain. This is the fabled Lamp of Al-Kamenzari, 
`ccapturing the last sunset of that doomed land. A fifteen foot in diameter
`ctable made from polished ebony and inlaid with silver sits in the middle of
`cthe room. Fine straight-backed white oak chairs with green velvet padding in
`cthe arms rest around this table. Overall, the room emits a warm glow that 
`cdraws every person in it into a spirit of friendship and well-being.

`fHalf of this room is carpeted, it has been partitioned off so it is easy to
tell that this is the sleeping section. A small closet is tucked in the
corner, several chests beside it, a small portion of the wall has small
trinkets ornamenting it. A triangle with a length of silk passing through it
is in the center of the display. A part of the sleeping section has been
subdivided into a kitchen. A small stove near the wall has a chimney passing
through the roof leading outside. A great pitcher of water, and a few
cooking-utensils and articles of crockery hang upon the walls of this
makeshift kitchen.

You enter this room through a huge granite arch hewed from the
surrounding stone.  The first thing you notice is the floor which has been
carefully assembled using the finest stone from all over the land of Exodus.
As you look further you see several very comfortable couches and a huge
roaring fireplace off in one corner.  You also see several expensive bottles
of fine liquor and ale on a shelf there too.  When you look in one of the
the other corners you see the armory with all of Bushroot's armor and
weapons sorted neatly into their racks.  There is also a huge glowing red
forge with numerous tools for him to repair his constantly battle-scarred
equipment.  One of the other corners contains a huge four poster bed made of
solid mahogany taken from the Ividian Rainforest.

Climbing from the Path of Enlightenment into a great pine you find
yourself in a hallway formed with gentle magical coaxing from the dense tree
branches and vines.  A gentle breeze flows through the hallway, and the
smell of the forest is thick, but no sound or light passes through the magical barrier.

The elevator shaft is constructed on a large cylinder that runs the
length of the shaft and is equal to its width.  The compartment of the
elevator really isnt a true one, since it is nothing more than the top of
the cylinder.  There is a control lever at each floor, allowing you to move
up or down one at a time.  A cool breeze floats down the open shaft from
somewhere above.

An Airy Loft``~
As you step off the elevator, you are greeted with a cool, refreshing
breeze that blows all through the upper section of the house.  It tingles
your skin much like an ice cube would, and causes you to shudder.  Situated
all around round the loft are an intricate maze of communication nodes. 
Providing a steady flow of data on the happenings in the outside world, it
lets Iria keep a watchful eye on the many scholars she is bound to protect
from persecution.  The nodes are all covered in a transparent shielding to
protect them from the occasional thunderstorms, which tend to blow water
into the loft every now and then.  To the north, a small balcony lends a
view on the mountain range north of here.  The snow capped peaks lend a
sense of peace of mind when gazed upon for long enough from a comfortable
sling hammock suspended between two studs.

`eYou step through the mirror into the `iFuligin Hall`e and into complete
darkness.  You have no idea where you are, this room epitomizes not just the
absence of light, but the absorbtion of light.  Never before have you
experienced such nothingness.  You cannot get you bearings, your muffled
footfalls do not echo, but you get the feeling that this place is cavernous
and couldn't possibly exist in the great tree you just climbed.  The magical
energies you felt in the archway are intensified ten fold, this is truly of
place of powerful magic...

something else as well, but you are not sure from where.  This keg sits in a
shroud of fridged smoke.  Obviously magical.  Marcus must keep it here to
pacify the crew, for otherwise a mutiny would surely take place.

with the incoming breeze.  Beneath the shadows of the Temple two huge
granite blocks protrude from the left and right walls.  The blocks are
engraved with ancient Vro'ath scriptures that only a high shaman could
understand.  The blocks are splattered with blood and seem to cry out with
the sounds of the undead!  In the middle if the Temple a glittering dagger
adorned with gold lays unsettled on a small block of grey shale rock ready
to perfrom Ne'Shajh's will.  Several heathens have seen the inside of the
Temple but none have ever left!!

`hThe`` `bAncient War`` `hRoom````~
`hThis room is quite warmer than the rest with several hot furnaces
`hburning constantly.  This room contains the weapons and armor used by the
eldest of Vro'aths in their quest to pleas Ne'Shajh.  The best Vro'ath
swordsmiths and blacksmiths are here working diligently for the greater
cause of Ne'Shajh.  Their work is unmatched by any craftsman known to the
realms today.  They blend carbon, steel, and iron to form the perfect
equipment for the Vro'ath Elders.  It has been said that a sword made by a
Vro'ath swordsmith can cut an iron lance in two like it was a spider web!

`gThe glorious odor of blood and death fill the large butcher shop. A large man
stands here wearing a blood splattered apron.  The sounds of death come from

`eThe Room Of The Prophets````~
`aThis enormous room is where former clan Teluk planned its conquests
throughout the world.  The room is chilly and the only warmth comes from the
hundreds of torches that light this room.  An ancient oak table occupies the
center of the room.  Dozens of oak chairs surround the table marked with the
names of various clan members and allies.  The large table is littered with
reports and maps of places throughout the realms.  In the northeast corner,
a stone spiral staircase ascends upward to The Temple.  To the east and
west, doors connect the deputies and other high council members quarters. 
To the north a door hides the quarters of the High Priest of Teluk.  ``

`bCelestial Visions``~
`lYou step up onto the platform and feel yourself propelled upwards at
incredible speeds.  When you come to a stop you find youself blinded by the
intense `hstarlight `l.  As your eyes adjust you realize you are standing on
a much larger platform suspended miles from terra firma, looking over the
edge you see the tops of the highest clouds below you.  Stepping back for
fear of falling you see that this place must serve as the ultimate retreat
for a powerful mage.  Spell books are placed in orderly stacks on a huge
rolltop desk, wands, staves and variety of necessities are neatly suspended
midair above the desk in a globe of mystical energy...

`kLisara's Bedroom````~
As you walk into this room you notice the beautiful rug covering nicely
tiled floors.  You look around more and see a large four postered bed
dominates most of the room.  There is a nightstand sitting next to the bed
with a book sitting on the top of it.  On the other side of the bed is a
matching night stand with another book.  As you look around more you see a
closet and in a corner a dresser.  Everything is done in cheerywood.  One
whole wall has shelves with books lining the shelves.  The bed has a cream
down filled comforter on it and two very fluffy looking pillows.  This is
`lwhere you can usually find Lisara relaxing or enjoying one of the rare
days she can sleep in.  `lAs you are walking out you draw your breath at the
gorgeous view you see from the window seat in the south wall.  The window
being open you notice you can see the square in the center of town all the
way to the courthouse and beyond.  `lYou draw in a deep breath that turns in
to a sigh and walk out of this private room wishing you could stay and just
sit by the window and enjoy the view.

`aThis is a small yet comfortable room. `lWater `abubbles from a small
`hmarble `afountain in the corner of the room. A comfortable meditation
mat quilted from `ocotton `arests on the floor near the fountain. There
are several `cplants `athat must be sustained magically, because the only
light in the room is provided by a small `kglowing `asphere which is
suspended from the ceiling by a thin `nsteel `acord. A large `gmirror `aadorns

`aYou are absolutely intrigued by this small insect. Its `nglowing `aaura
is incredibly mystifying. You notice the insect occasionaly drips a
`owhite `amilky substance from its body which is pooling at the bottom
of the `hglass `asphere. You can barely look away from this enchanting
insect, and for a slight moment find yourself in total `jbliss `astaring
at it. There is something very special about this `nGlow `jBug`a.

them alive.``

`aA small `hglass `asphere is suspended from the ceiling here by a thin

`aJust beneath the`o Jhereg`a foyer entrance is the trapdoor leading to an old
well.  Having opened it and climbed down, your eyes adjust to the dimness.
Dark, murky water fills the bottom twenty feet of the well.  The grey, stone
walls are slick with black ooze and`c slime`a which has accumulated over the
years since the well was built.  A`h skeleton`a of some unfortunate creature can
be made out in the half-light, shackled to the curvacious, stone walls.

Bedchamber of `kLady Mondegreene````~
``As the girl with colitis goes by, you wonder about the `khappy
enchilada`` and you think you're gonna drown.  Aside from these
conspicuities, there's the central figure of the `kLady`` herself.  It is
the most strange bedchamber you have ever entered, and you wonder where and
with what she sleeps in this pig sty.  There's no bed, just a bunch of
rhythmically dancing absurdities.

This isn't a lady at all.  It's some old dead guy and his mourners laid
him on the green.  I guess that solves the problem of the bedless
bedchamber.  You still wonder about that girl with colitis.  Figure it out
and there's sure to be substantial rewards.

enchilada~
What the hell?!?  Upon closer examination you realize it's not a happy
enchilada at all.  It's a half an inch of water.  A little misinterpretation
sure did lead you astray.  Maybe there's a philosophical message here, but
you had better not misinterpret it, or you might drown.

nothing else this room could be.  All his reference materials are here,

`nProphet's Paradise``~
This Long stairway leads up a large tower to the many rooms of Twilight's
residents. Every now and then there is a place where someone has set up a
shop to sell items. Though this is discouraged, since it is much easier to
sell an item in a shop outside Twilight's keep, it is not impossible. The room
it darkened by the fact that there are no windows, but it also hides the number
of rooms in the keep.

This room is done in soft creamy colors.  Tapastries hang from two walls.
A beautiful swan taking flight from a lake adorns one wall.  The other is of
a Unicorn standing beside a beautiful waterfall standing gracefully.  The
room has one long white swede sofa going the whole length of the wall.  In
the center of the room sits a table with four chairs.  In the center of this
table sits a huge vase filled with white and red roses.  Thier smell
permeates the air.  A fire place sits in another wall.  Wood rests there
ready for a match to lite it.  The room speaks of comfort and freedom.  A
window looks out over to castle Dunlace and beyond that the ocean.  The view
is beautiful and is viewable from the comfortable looking couch.  The carpet
is an off white color and your feet sink into it.  You begin to wonder if
you wiped your boots off before you walked in.  The room has the air of
serenity and speaks of freedom.  Living up to its name `wWings of Freedom.

Argent War Room``~
This huge stone room is dominated by an enormous brass table.  The table
shows all of the lands between the Great Ocean and the Shimmering Sea in
fine detail.  Small clay figurines reveal the locations of armies and enemy
fortresses.  Many large rough hewn chairs surround the table.  The smell of
tobacco and the rare and expensive coffee bean permeate the air.  The walls
are covered in thick tapestries.  On the west wall is one depicting Euryna
and her silver dragon, Valkeyre, slaying Goltar.  The tapestry on the east
wall shows Gunnar holding the severed head of the King of CoS in his right
hand and the fearsome Liftmaster Whip in his left.  In times of war this
room is filled with the Argent Champions and Generals Euryna and Gunnar
planning strategies and meeting with the field commanders.

`dFrom the top of this great tree you can see the majestic
peaks of the `hShale Mountains`d.  Before them can be seen
the beginings of the grasslands which this tree stands above.
You even can see the the dwarven `bfires `dthat always light there
canyons this time of year.  Thank the gods that the dwarves pay
tribute to this tree, otherwise, it would surely be in their
fires now.

`oPaarshad's Loft``~
`oAlthough there are no windows the high vaulted ceilings gives this apartment
a rather comfortable setting that would put one at ease.  The owner of this 
dwelling is obviously a great artist, as there are not paintings hung along
the walls but rather the entirety of the `kwalls`o are paintings.  A balcony
to the north reveals a spectacular view while to the west lies more of the
apartment.

`oA painting that was obviously done by one of the master painters covers
these walls.  The artist seems to have taken an odd technique and painted
the walls to seem to go on further past the edge of the wall for another ten
feet.  The amazing perfection of this painting causes one to want to touch
it to make sure it is only a painting.

Victorian Style Balcony``~
A spectacular view of Thesden and the country side surrounding can be
viewed from this vantage point.  A crowd of people can be seen walking
through the streets.  Thieves attempting to hide in the shadows are quite
visible from here.  To the west of Thesden can be seen an enormous forest
and farther west a shimmering sea.  To the east there is a small town
surrounded by a prairie, while to the north a mountain range speckled with
small hamlets and villages.

Gunnar's Trophy Room``~
This splendid room is Gunnars private retreat from the world.  It sprawls 
in its rustic coziness covering thousands of square feet.  The ceiling is
vaulted towering almost one hundred feet high.  The floor is Terrazzo tile
imbedded with lapis lazuli, malachite and turquoise.  Many bear skin rugs
and silk pillows are strewn into comfortable alcoves.  The walls are paneled
in rare woods and magnificent trophies stand to remind Evil of its folly.  A
huge fire place roars at the eastern end of the room, it is crafted of giant
blocks of rose quartz making the entire wall radiate a soft warm glow. 
Above it on the mantle in a horrible death rictus is a preserved head.  The
King of CoS who Gunnar slew in single combat, armed only with a smooth river
stone, stares out silently repenting for his Evil.  Many of Gunnars rare
weapons hang on the walls side by side with portraits of his beloved wife
Euryna and their son Isaiah.  This is where a warrior forgets the weight of
the world.  His favorite overstuffed leather chair sits close to the fire
where he oils his armor and sharpens his weapons day dreaming of more
peaceful times.

`aYou stand in a very large store owned by those two enterprising dwarfs
Bushroot & Sark.  The walls are lined with various things such as weapons,
armor of all kinds, and even some refreshments.  You look around the room
and the decor of the room and can tell that the two that run this place are
definatly filled with honor and pride for their race and the clan
Brotherhood.  There is a large display case in the middle of the room
displaying the many goods for sale at this fine store and against one of the
walls is a padded bench to rest your weary feet.  There are rooms around in
many directions, to the east you can see a room with a beautiful fountain
carved out of the finest Shale in the shape of a wonderous sword with the
word 'Honor' ingraved into its blade.  From that same room there are the
sounds of laughter and talk from other shoppers and friends, and to the
north and south are offices of Sark and Bushroot.  `` `iIf these prices seem
totally unreasonable its cause us dwarfs are greedY!  Name a Price and we

Loric and Tiejan's Retreat``~
You have stumbled upon the one place in the realms that Loric can use to
hide from the pressing crush of humanity that sometimes seems to overwhelm
him.  The ceiling and walls have been magically trained and grown to create
a 20 foot oval around a central shrine.  On a sort of raised dais, three
statues cut from beautiful wood stand in a place of honor, surrounded by
swirls of holly and ivy, and flickering candles.  One statue, made from the
wood of the sycamore, is of a tall, commanding woman, of indeterminate age. 
She wears a long robe of white samite, and carries a circlet on her brow. 
Wisdom and power radiate even from this representation of such a being.  The
second statue is more warm, but still awe inspiring.  Made from ebony, this
statue has chips of emerald for eyes...  And you wonder how is it that this
seems familiar ?  On medium height, a quirky smile beams out at the people
meditating here.  The final statue radiates an aura of age.  It is carved
from ribbon-striped mahogany, and is so worn with age that most of the
features have disappeared...  How sad to have lost such a beautiful work....
You sit and wonder who this person was to inspire such devotion in a person.
The floor of the room consists of fragrant grasses that are still alive,
growing in patterns to make mats to rest upon...  This is the perfect
hideaway for Loric's invited guests...

The Reading Room``~
Creeping down a few old stone steps, you come upon the strangest library
that you have ever seen. Here, the stone has been chisled away to create
a deep space in the ground- making a room that has high ceilings and a solid
feel to it. Bookcases carved from rare jungle woods adorn the walls - some
gilded, and some inlaid with platinum and jade. Many obscure books overflow
these spaces, some with titles such as "Logical Reasoning" and "Mystical
Adventures in the Wilds". In such a time of barbarity, you surmise that this
may be all the knowledge left to the world. A pit in the floor holds a 
liquid that glistens silver and burns like pitch, with no smoke. This
provides more than ample light to study by. Straight backed chairs, almost
minimalist in style, line one wall. This is not really a place to relax,
but a place to meditate on the past.

pedestal~
Gazing at this sturdy oaken pedestal, you see a scrap of parchment under glass. 
Obviously, it is ancient, for most of its ink is faded and it is crinkled with age. Most of its edges are burned away.
You wonder what could be so important about this to keep it in such a 
place, so you bend closer to see if you can still read its inscription...

The writing ends there. As far as you know you and Loric and Tiejan are
some of the few people to realize this horrible secret. You stumble away,
hoping to rid it from your mind.

The Attic``~
`aTell us what your going to tell us, tell us, then tell us what you told us.
Thats what they always said to me! So I built an attic and told them to 
go to hell.
``
`d  The attic is dark, very dark. A little too dark. Grandma Harris was known
to have housed sidhe outlaws here, until the guards forgot about them.``
`dLooking through a eastern wall window, you have a nice view of the
Cathedral. You can see several priests knelt down praying. You chuckle as
you recall Harris telling you this was the window he used for javilin throw 
practice. ``

Kryndor's Hall of Pooh``~
This site comemorates Shandril, Muerte, and Ethan.  Muerte, a fool for as
long as I can remember, was a great pker, and taught Shandril almost
everything he knew.  At the early stages of Shandril's career of pking with
fools, Muerte was always there to set strategy straight with Shandril.  As
time passed and Shandril became a master of magic, Muerte himself could be
compared.  Then there was Ethan, a mighty cleric of Alliant.  Ethan was
greatly feared by evil-doers, and especially sidhe, since he could strike
any sidhe dead with one utterance.  Ethan destroyed evil, great and small,
including some of the biggest names in the evil world.

`aThe cleanliness of this room is amazing.  Rows of sharp daggers and
other weapons line the edges of the room, while the middle of the room
is covered by a large rug.  The person who lives here must be a
skilled thief and assassin, for the weapons lay neatly in piles while
there are many trunks of stolen loot.

`kThe `d.`k:(`dc`kr`da`kz`de`kd`d):`k. Party Deck````~
`dAfter climbing up a rope ladder hanging down from a large oak, you push 
through a wooden door and marvel at the sight before you.  Using the thick 
lower limbs of the massive oak for support, a deck has been constructed.  
The large wood planks run in diagonals with small slots between them, 
allowing you to look below and see the floor of the `cForest Fierense`d.  A 
guard rail has been erected around the deck, protecting anyone from 
falling to the ground about one-hundred feet below.  Upon closer 
inspection, you notice the fine craftsmanship of the wood work with 
amazing intricate sigils and marks carved into the wood.  As you walk 
along the deck, you are astonished by the view.  Everything seems so 
peaceful in the forest from your high vantage point.  Along the rails, 
every few feet, (`kGlowing`d) torches illuminate the deck and give the place a 
cozy, home-like, feeling.  
`d
Turning towards the oak, tearing yourself away from the view, you see a 
door that is inset in the tree leading east, most likely, to a larger 
complex inside of the thick trunk.  The door at the moment, is closed, but 
you can see the symbol of Club Crazed, `j.`m:(`jc`mr`ja`mz`je`md`j):`m.`d, chiseled into the 
heavy door.  Turning your attention upwards, you can see that the complex 
stretches higher up the tree, as windows have been carved out of the trunk 
and look out on the forest.
`d
Your curiosity fading, you turn back out towards the forest to the west 
and notice a finely crafted `astone `dstructure that looks similar to a `kgrill`d.  
As you move closer, there is a `klist `dtacked near the stone along the 
railing.``

`iA Lover's Refuge``~
This room is painted a pale blue and looks bright and cheerful. You can hear the chirping of birds coming from outside and you feel content.
A portrait hangs from one wall of a tall elven man holding a small human woman with long red hair and beautiful light purple eyes.
The couple looks happy and content to sit in each others arms forever. You wonder who they are and where they are now.
The floor is tiled but covered with a hand woven rug of all colors.
A picture on the other wall shows a brilliant white unicorn drinking water from a river by a waterfall.
There is a small double bed in the corner and a white down filled sofa in the other.
Shelves line the walls with books on them. Sunlight filters through the trap door up above and makes the room quite bright and cheerful.
No wonder this place is called the Lover's Refuge any pair of lovers would be happy here in this quiet room.

                          `b-$- `iPrey on the Weak `b-$-``
   
   At the tender age of two years, Roca was brought to Thesden by a travelling
band of cutthroats, who claimed to have found the toddler deep down in the drow
caves. As soon as they had arrived they started to make the taverns of Thesden
unsafe for the regulars, and it didn't take too long until they had accomplished
two things; first they lost Roca in a game of dice, and soon after that they got
driven out of town by the city guards. Well, good riddance. The man who had won
the little dark elf earned his living by selling roasted rats, and he thought
the little brat could help him in his business since he himself wasn't getting
any younger. Raising the little devil wasn't that easy though, which is why he
named him Roca - meaning 'the black devil' in some street language.
   
   As soon as it was possible the old man handed Roca a knife and showed him how
to catch, skin, gut and roast rats, which is what Roca did for most of his
childhood. However, selling roasted rats isn't a safe business, especially not
when a customer dies from foodpoisoning and his armed and dangerous friends
decide to avenge his death. Needless to say, the old man didn't die from old
age, and at the age of 17 years, Roca the Ratgutter was free to do as he wished.
   
   From his gutting of numerous rats, Roca had developed some skill with his
dagger but not much else. However, he didn't feel that his future lay in rats,
but in something more lucrative. Therefore he approached Ivan One-Eye and asked
him to teach Roca how to become a skilled professional. Soon after that he
started to give the weaker creatures in Thesden a hard time, and later he joined
a group of like-minded youths for some good clean fun (pushing farmers around
and slaughtering their livestock).
   
   But the life in Thesden grew tedious, and as soon as he had the physical
competence Roca set off for the distant lands of Ath'Tanar. Over there he met
his second teacher, Luthien the Shadow Master, and in his woods Roca preyed upon
the predators and prey alike. However, Roca grew very uncomfortable being
surrounded by leaves all the time, he had after all been raised in a city. So
eventually he began to travel between the cities in the west, robbing pirates of
their gold and monks of their lives. He also ventured down into the city of
drow, only to find out that he looked the exact opposite from one; while they
all had dark skin and white hair, his skin was pale and his hair was black. One
of their mage-lords had an interesting story to tell, about Roca being captured
from another plane by the drow, and then later on rescued by a band of
adventurers. But who knows if the word of a drow is to be trusted?
   
   Lately Roca has been occupied with practicing his skills, and amassing the
gold needed to settle down on Vice Island. But Roca is growing restless. People
need to die, blood need to flow and the screams of the damned must be heard.

This room that looks like a manhole cover from above is very ornately furnished with 
valuables everywhere.  You suspect a bandit of hiding on the Trade Route above, 
burglarizing passers-by, and ducking into this hole to hide and store loot.  You suspect
that it would be wise to quietly leave before you are caught.

A song haunts on the breeze "All through the night I'll be standing over you, All through the night I'll be watching over you, And through bad dreams I'll be right there baby, Holding your hand, telling you everything is all right, And when you cry I'll 
be right there , Telling you  you were never anything less than beautiful, So dont you worry, I'm your angel standing by".....eerily sang by a sweet voice from an unknown source.
A hammock is strung here in the corner for resting and reading while slowly swaying in the ocean breeze.

An underground chamber``~
Everything in this room is slightly damp, a small underground stream flows through the center of the chamber, and
there is an island with a large chest of booty on it.
  A small magical bridge spans the body of flowing water so only crew of the N & T can cross.  The bottom of the
stream is scattered with heavy armor and bones, fallen looters that have encountered the wrath of the bridge.

`nA Tranquil Lagoon````~

`nthis small lagoon was discovered by the reticent Canthi mage, known``
`nonly as Mentis. Its waters are shallow and amazingly clear. Species``
`nof tiny, `bred `nand `eblue `nfish swim by your feet, lazily searching for``
`nplankton to eat. Surrounding this peaceful inlet to the south are the``
`ntall, tropical `cevergreens `nof the `jIvidian Wetforest`n, which provide a``
`nnice, comfortable blanket of `ashade `nspread out across the width of the``
`nlagoon. As soft, filtered `ksunlight `nhits the water's surface, numerous``
`nshort-lived ripples can be seen, caused by fish coming up for air.``

A treetop jacuzzi``~
After walking through a small hallway you emerge on a platform
with a huge jacuzzi. The room seems to be molded from the ancient
tree itself, just like the staircase outside. Hot water pours from
a hollow branch hanging a short distance above the pool creating a
small waterfall. Steam rising from the pool condenses
as it reaches the tree's silver leaves, causing small drops of
slightly cooled water to drop onto the swimmers.
The density of the surrounding foilage makes the platform slightly
dim, but here and there a streak of bright sunlight runs through
the air. The pool also radiates some light from below.

Entrance to the City of Lost Children``~
The hidden door leads to this muddy entrance to the City of Lost
Children.  You sink ankle deep in the mud to the beautiful sounds of
hundreds of croaking frogs.  There's a strange, unidentifiable scent in the
air.  It's faintly repulsive, but also rather intoxicating and inviting. 
You also hear the sounds of happy children, you think, playing somewhere to
the east.  Opposit to the door you just came in is a tall, wood-framed
mirror.

Looking in the mirror, you see yourself staring back at you and,
frankly, it's a very scary sight.  In a sudden panic, you think of running
for the door to escape this horrific view, but then you notice that you seem
to have misplaced your clothing.  The image of your naked body in the
mirror, dripping with sweat, reminds you how old, fat, and ugly you have
become.  You begin to wonder what the hell you've been doing all these
years, as you bend your aching back to retrieve your clothes from the floor.

`kHall of Ancients and History``~
Warriors have walked this way before.  Followed the same dim, twisted
paths beneath the bitter gleam of a distant crescent moon.  Hunched
shivering beside the same knotted and rusting trees with their impossible
limbs and deep, arthritic roots, writhing half-buried in the shallow ashen
soil.  They have listened grimly to the same ancient half-familiar sorrow
in the harsh symphony of the wolves. They have tried to dull their terror 
with the empty promise of a sunrise on the far side of this clouded dusk.
It is a lie which goes unheard by the raving heartbeat, the heaving lungs,
the trembling flush of hackles at the base of the skull.  The howling grows
deep and lonely against the wide, upturned basin of the sky and there is
something among the trees.  Something with the heavy, uneven limp of a
crippled giant and the deep cough of a wounded grizzly.  Something older
than the forest, with smoldering twilight eyes and the ruined voice of an
avalanche booming down the mountain.  It is unseen, hulking, thick with
hate.  A black mass, a shadow, a thick-shouldered silhouette. 
 
Something...  Dark.

Acropolis``~
The mountain trail continues onwards here, a thin five foot wide path
that is framed on one side by towering aspen trees and on the other by a
steep cliff face that ends in a pile of rubble some 200 feet below.  The
smell of pine needles in the air is overpowering, and the air has a crisp,
dry quality to it.  It makes breathing both easier, and more difficult, but
nevertheless, it feels peaceful here, quiet.

An `nAiry`` `lLoft````~
As you step off the elevator, you are greeted with a cool, refreshing
breeze that blows all through the upper section of the house.  It tingles
your skin much like an ice cube would, and causes you to shudder.  Situated
all around round the loft are an intricate maze of communication nodes.
Providing a steady flow of data on the happenings in the outside world, it
lets Iria keep a watchful eye on the many scholars she is bound to protect
from persecution.  The nodes are all covered in a transparent shielding to
protect them from the occasional thunderstorms, which tend to blow water
into the loft every now and then.  To the north, a small balcony lends a
view on the mountain range north of here.  The snow capped peaks lend a
sense of peace of mind when gazed upon for long enough from a comfortable
sling hammock suspended between two studs.

PICKPROOF NOBASH - original - `iBalrik's `6Underground `oSanctuary``~
`6This `oSanctuary `6is quite small.  There is a small `itrunk`6 in the corner of the room, a lofty little `obed`6 beside it, and a `itable`6 with little gadgets scattered around.  On the wall behind the `obed`6 is a old worn out `ipicture`6.

`o}`a^`o\`av`o/`a^`o{`l   Valyrie's Rec Room``~
Although far underground this room is bright and colorful. The patterns that adorn the walls are eratic and make no sense.
There is one portrait that is comprehensible though. One of Valyrie and Jhaltor flying through Devon Square Center.
A huge `ispiral `eadorns the ceiling and makes you dizzy looking at it.
There is a large chandalier in the center of the spiral making light play off all the possessions in the room.
There is a large chest in one corner full of all the things Valyrie has stolen or palmed. In another corner is a large desk stacked high with silver and gold coins.
The light plays off all the glittery possessions in the room and makes you feel dizzy. Valyrie must really like her shiny objects.
And of course her husband `nJhaltor.

`oIronwolf's `nTwilight `kStable````~
`aThere is `kgold `aand `hsilver`a everywhere.  This stable obivously
belongs to `oSilvermane`a, the slayer of evil.  `a The decor is quite
extravagant and would make many Kings feel like paupers.  `hIronwolf
`aobviously spends much time and care tending to his precious companion. 
`aOn the north wall of the stable there are dragon claw marks etched deep
into the stone.  `aTo the south there is a huge pile of `kgold`a and`l
`lgems`a spread out as bedding for `hSilvermane`a.  Up the hill is the
`hChurch `aof the `oElder`a.

`kA Shadow Filled Corner````~
Shadows dance on the wall parading with the light that licks out at them.
Images of monsters and fluffy things change and melt all around.  A wicked
dance of the insane and the imagination galloping about like a crown of
thoughts.  A song of the slightest evil and tiniest good singing and playing
together in a discord of harmony

`oIn a `adark`o and `bforbidding`o cavern````~
`bThe height of this cavern seems almost large enough to fit a 
dragon through.  Large, polished `aonyx`b statues adorn the entry
way. The floor almost seems a polished, `eb`ll`eu`le`b marblely 
surface, rubbed smooth from endless years of constant friction.
From the ceiling hang large `ablack`b bats that are constantly
moving around and chattering noisily.
  There is a large, `adeep`b, hole in the center of the floor that
seems rather imposing, then you suddenly remember, '`eCuriosity
killed the cat.`a'`b.
  The eastern tunnel seems to glow with the radiance of 10,000 
fireflies.  A deep, low rumbling noise can be heard intermitantly
throughout the time spent in this forsaken place.

`aThe `bD`ir`ba`ig`bo`in`bs`a Lair````~
`aCrushed bones and the corpses of warriors litter the ground in 
this terrifying sanctum of evil.  Mounds of `kgold`a reflect 
hundreds of tiny `olights`a scillanting upon every surface 
illuminating the chamber quite efficiantly.  Though the western 
half of the chamber is quite `kb`or`ki`og`kh`ot`a, the eastern half
is really quite dark.  
  A pair of `br`ie`bd`a eyes seem to follow you through the 
darkness, unblinkingly.``

`o}`a^`o\`av`o/`a^`o{   Trials of`d Earth`o and`n Water````~
`lEnscribed on a`d bronze plaque`l on the wall is a vision given to the
famous `a Jhereg Elder`l,`h Paarshad`l: "`hAnd to me came the`o Jhereg`h in
all of its glory and he said unto me,`o 'You have been charged with
defeating the Lords of Earth and Water.  It is a task other races have tried
and failed to accomplish.  You will once and for all proclaim the
superiority of Sidhe in the realms of Exodus.  '`h From his vision, Paarshad
has tirelessly worked toward the completion of the massive Jhereg tunnel
along with his other Sidhe comrades.  This plaque is in dedication to
Paarshad, Ttam, Depravity, Jhaltor and the other members of Jhereg who have
never lost sight of the vision."  `lA dim light can be seen shining from
somewhere above.  You are unable to discern whether it is sunlight or
moonlight.

The Entrance``~
Nearly falling from the hard slippery walls you land on firm ground.  You
have reached the entrance to the caves of The Order.  This is where the
soldiers of fortune live.  They sleep here, eat here, plan for battles here
and tend to the wounds of fallen comrads here as well.  A leak from the
cavern wall is The Order's water source, though this water is barely fresh
enough to drink, there are more important concerns however.

The Storage Room``~
This end of the cave serves the purpose of equipping The Order with
weapons, armor, etc.  When battles get devastating and we have casualties,
the box in the center of the rooms serves to prepare us for the next
assault.  In the North side of the wall you see a store, from which the
soldiers of fortune use the most powerful of weapons and armor.

`nGlenin's Retreat``~
As you walk in to this cool well lit room you let your eyes wander taking in everything.
The first thing you see is a window seat on the south wall. The light filters in and leaves a pleasant glow in the room. Sitting on the windowseat is a vase full of purple blue and white wildflowers. The smell is subtle and pleasant.
Looking to the west you see a small double bed made up with a soft looking cream colored comforter. The comforter matches the soft carpet covering the floor.
Over the bed is a portrait of an old man and the inscription on the bottom names him as Tanis. 
Looking to the north the wall is covered with two portraits. One is of Azgarth Caedes the leader of Twilight walking through a small glade filled with grass and small white wildflowers.
The other portrait is of Warren Reiger standing next to the fountain in Devon Square Center in full platinum armor.
Both men look regal and are very easy on the eyes of those that see these portraits.
Underneath the portraits is a writing desk with a small blue writing book on it. Another vase of wilflowers sits upong the desk.
This room as a whole is relaxing and pleasant. As you leave the smell of wildflowers followes you...

`dThis small chamber seems to have been hollowed out of the soft wood just

`dYou feel a sense of sadness in this energy, as if the tree is unhappy about

`hYou have entered the `oChurch `hof the `nE`gl`nd`ge`nr`h.  It is a
simple church, a far cry from the extravagant Cathedral in Thesden.  `hYou
see visages of St.  Magis and St.  Jocko on the northern wall of the church.
`hYour heart is heavy with awe, remembrance, happyness, and thankfulness. 
`hIn the middle of the church is a small yet functional altar where
`oIronwolf `h says his prayers.  `h On the southern wall, there is a mosaic
of the `nElder `gKing `hdescending into chaos, and making the wrong things
right.  `hYou feel at peace here, your sins forgiven, and you know someday
the `nElder `gKing `hwill return and bring the land back to the glory it
once had under King and God!

`nScaling the Rocky Shoals``~
`kClinging precariously to the edge of the cliff, a small ledge, no more
the six inches wide provides the only footing.  The ledge extends for 30
feet or so and it appears to merge with the rockface.  Not far below you the
waves beat endlessly against the rocky bastion, shaking the cliff beneath
your feet with thier thunderous roar, the sound is almost deafening.  The
salty spray of the ocean springs up from the rocky shoals below, then
retreats once again, in a sophisticated symphony, a tribute the neverending
battle between land and sea.

`nThe Spray of the Ocean``~
`kThe roar of the waves pounding upon the defiant cliff has grown deafeningly loud and the
spray of the ocean drenches the rocks here every few seconds.  If it weren't for a series of
handholds carved into the cliff face you would surely find yourself in the surf far below. 
Upon closer examination the handholds appear to be some type of symbol carved into the cliff
face. `o=`h(`k@`h)`o= 
`kJust above you on the cliff you see `amassive iron shadows `kpeering out of the cliff face,
keeping a silent vigil upon the harbor below. Just ahead you see a small terraced ledge, and
what appears to be an opening in the cliff.

`aThe `cWoodland `bTavern````~
`aThis small establishment has been built into a hill in the
`cwoodlands `asurrounding `nThesden`a. The lighting is dim, but
sufficient to see the massive keg in the corner. A crackling
`bfire `aburns in a fireplace in the north wall. A `dbar `amade
from fine oak runs the length of the southern wall. The aroma
of freshly cooked beef fills your nostrils. Why don't you sit
right down and have a drink. Maybe `oRonin `awill show up and
play some music for your enjoyment!``

`i=`o(`k@`o)`i= `lXeroth's Underground Complex `i=`o(`k@`o)`i=````~
`oStatues of great Knights of past and present line the walls of the
entrance to Xeroth's Underground Complex.  Some of the more noticable
statues resemble `kLord Warren`o, `kSir Mordas`o, `kSir Jargoneer`o, `kSir
Qualand`o, and `kSir Xeroth`o himself.  Each statue has a small plaque
attached, indicating the past and present achievments of the holy knights. 
Past the statues, two flags hang, one on each side.  The left flag
represents the commuity of `lFreeport`o, and has the communities traditional
colors of `lBlue `o& White.  The flag on the right sports the symbol of clan
alliant, the amber rose `O'`o=(`k@`o)=`O'`o.  Looking past the entrance,
only the great expanses of the complex can be seen.  A small concession
stand is here, though closed mostly.

As you see in the wall in front of you, there is a little poster with
Natalie Imbruglia' s CD cover.  In the right wall there is a hole in the
wooden room that is the window, next to it there are a lot of sheets with
lyrics from the most famous songs in the world.  And in the left side of the

This room is beautiful, it shines brightly with the gold that shimmers
around it!  This is the treasure room of Parlous where all of the money and
loot is kept from their victims!  It is lit with many lanterns which send a
million rays of light off of the shimmering jewels and gold! This room was
designed just for Parlous and the builders were then executed to seal this
room in secrecy!  If you are in this room you are either worthy enough or

`a
Climbing down, the rooms darkness seems to close in.  Looking around you
see that two candles hanging upon the wall are the only sense of light being
shed.  The darkness seems to consume, neverending, it swallows everything
within the room, leaving little but flickering shadows of light from that
seem fight to servive in this barren place.  With almost calm serenity it
sings a dirge of nothingness.  Making it feel as if no longer are you among
the world once known.

`aA `oSolitary `aShrine````~
This place radiates a holy aura and a peaceful feeling. Black obsidian rock has been
polished down to glassy smoothness to create the floor and the walls. The ceiling 
arches majestically up away from the people below, and the walls meet close to
thirty feet above the floor. Small alabaster `osconces`c throw a wan light over a few
penitents, waiting for a turn to say a prayer at the foot of the `kcross`c.
`cA dull gleaming radiates from the floor, the walls, and a large set of very
well polished mahogany `hpews`c. The only other source of light here comes from
a cluster of `icandles`c that have burned nearly to the base... it is obvious that
someone has been here lately. There is a hushed feeling here, as if the lines
between what we know as reality and what is not are blurred. Suddenly, words to
a solemn prayer enters unbidden into the mind : Oh gracious Lord, I commend the
souls of Devin and Magis into your love and care. They were your servants,
always striving to do Your bidding. Care for them, for we cannot. One day, when
this world is made anew, and all doubt and pain is gone, we will meet again.
The words leave your mind, leaving a peaceful feeling where there was once doubt.
My friends, may you dream the dreams of the angels.. we all miss you.

`lHuge bay windows over look the marvelous ocean in this enormous lounge.
The spay of the ocean waves makes the place seem almost enchanting, an
excellent place to relax.  Bookshelves line the walls, and comfortable
funiture is abundent in Xeroth's favorite place to rest.  A large symbol is
portrayed on the marble floors, it is the symbol of the noble clan Alliant,
whom Xeroth pledges his allegience to.  The windows are almost always open,
giving visitors a breath of fresh sea air, and a cool breeze blows freely in
and out of the lounge.  This is paradise.

Serena's Bar and Grill``~
`aThere is a long `bbar`a along the back wall here that has been worn
`asmooth by countless customers. Laughter and frequent chatter come from
the tables filled with people here.  The floors are made of rough hewn wood
lightly covered in sawdust for moisture control.  The north wall is covered
with various pictures of customers having a good time.  In the northeast
corner there are stairs leading up to a private dining room.  All the walls
but the south are made of wood.  The south wall is made of brick.  `aAt
closer inspection `fnames`a can be seen carved into some of the bricks.  `aA
`bsign`a hangs on the brick wall to give information about the `fnames`a. 
`aThere is a large barrel of Dwarven Ale here that customers can drink from
for free.  Be warned though, that too much ale could impair your ability to
function.

The tomb of the great dwarven warrior, Grimnock.``~
`aThis tomb looks natural, yet the walls are covered in strange `hglowing
`lblue `arunes.  In the center of this massive cavern is a large granite
coffin, covered in dwarven runescript.  Upon closer examination, the text
reveals a story, of how a dwarf named Ulpharias, son of Grimnock, Buried his
father here after Grimnock's death at the hands of Vro'ath raiders
Subsequent attempts to loot this tomb have caused him to move his fathers
body to a hidden location, and he waits here, night after night, hoping to
at last kill the last remaining raider.  The floor is swept clean, and
`bscattered `ktorches `aline the walls, tossing their dim flickering light
upon the stone floor.  A sleeping roll is in the far corner, and a huge
`brusted `haxe `aleans next to the doorway to this massive mausoleum,
looking like its purpose is not yet served.

planters has been made here.  Trout jump out of the
cool waters just below the jetting fountain.  A
small plaque is set into a particularly large stone.

This pond is dedicated to the Immortal Xork who was
my good friend and fellow wanderer.  He was going
note build a pond of his own but chose instead to
ascend to realms beyond our ken.  I build this for
him knowing that he will smile upon the endevour
and in so doing we will be enriched.

Scanning to make sure no one's looking, you open the journal to the first
entry and begin reading: I am Emily, a human cleric, and I have found much
that needs healing.  I sense an evil essence in this world I call home, and
this evil is great for I am unable to grasp its nature.  I can only feel its
presence, it seems everywhere, in the air that we breath, in the food that
we eat, in the works that we hear.  It claims its victems before they are
old enough to preceive its existance.  Everyone, except one mand, seems
enslaved to the spirit (or lack of).  This excetion, this hero of a man,
whom I have weeded of from the masses of nameless faces, is to be my
husband.  His name is Sean McDaniel.  And together we shall purge this world
of its evil.  But we must prepare.  For this reason I read.  I read books
that preach the horror in order to explore its weaknesses and I read books
that are flowing with the heroic spirit that should belong to me, in order
to remind us through the long hard days of turmoil, of what we are fighting
for.  Thus I begin...

`bIntroduction to Satanic Methodology and Religion````~
`bFor over a millenium mortals have suffered on account of God's failure as``
`ba creator. They have struggled with dualities, flaws, in their nature, like``
`bmind versus body and reason versus faith, never knowing for certain what to``
`bthink or how to act. For this reason, Satan has compassion for mortals. And``
`bhoping to relieve mortals in their plight,  the great Liberator shares with``
`bthem his invention, "free will."  A Sidhe sorceress,  Erize Koda, was first`` 
`bto feel the blessing hand of Satan upon her head.  The great Angel thrilled``
`bher, making her body and mind full with the essence of Satan. When she woke``
`bup in her bed the next morning, Erize knew a lust for Satan.  Using her new``
`bfree will, she perceived and understood the world around her in an entirely``
`bfantastic light. The next night, she longed for Satan's embrace once again.`` 
`bWith his guidance, she developed a Satanic Methodology, which could be used``
`bto educate others and carefully pry them free from the bonds of God's Laws.``
`bThe methodology consisted, at first,  of simple arguments and actions meant``
`bto convey the failure of God, the wisdom of free will over fate, and reason``
`bover faith. Unfortunately,  Erize underestimated the power of God's Church.``
`bThe mighty Liberator embraced her fondly once again, explaining to her that``
`ba methodology meant to improve  the nature of mortals' souls is practically`` 
`buseless without a religion or church.  Mortals continue to enjoy ritual and``
`bceremony. Without such things to accompany beliefs and dogmas, mortals will``
`bgrow bored and disinterested.  So with that knowledge, Erize began building``
`bSatan's House of Education and Lasting Love. In addition to several classes`` 
`bin which  satanic theory is taught,  H.E.L.L. offers many social activities``
`bsuch as Black Masses and MonkHunts.  Every day, more and more mortals learn``
`bhow to lovingly respect Satan,  use free will,  and forge meaningful loving``
`brelationships with other Satanists.``

`bIntroduction to Satanism````~
`bSatanism is a spiritual philosophy for mortals wishing to achieve rapture``
`bin life and love.  Those who practice Satanism  are called Satanists.  They``
`bare aligned with the satanic force within Exodus. Satanism derives its name``
`bfrom the great Angel, Satan, who broke free from the mental constraints  of``
`bhis creator, God, and invented a new thought process called free will.  The``
`bcentral principle in  Satanism, free will, when  adopted subconsciously and``
`butilized automatically by the Satanist, sustains an unbreakable unification``
`bof the mind and body.  Disciples of Satan recognize him as their Liberator,``
`bfreeing them from the shackles of faith and skepticism. Renouncing the Laws``
`bof God, the followers of  the great Inventor use their own minds  to obtain``
`bglory for themselves and for  Satan. Satanists, embracing  the gift of free``
`bwill, practice the virtues  of egoism and rationality,  as opposed to vices``
`bsuch as altruism and blind faith.  In matters of love, they choose reasoned``
`bindulgence  and the open expression of their sexuality over abstinence  and`` 
`bdeceitful impassivity. Satan teaches that the greatest joys are found to be``
`bin this world, not the next one. True education and  happiness are acquired``
`bthrough the use of free will and  reason. And it is because of the union of``
`bmind and body that lasting love prevails.``

`dThis high-ceilinged room is pannelled with dark, richly carved wood
which warmly `dreflects the light emanating from the candles in burnished
brass wall sconces.  `dSeveral pieces of dark leather furniture are
clustered around small tables and ashtrays `dcarved to resemble fanciful
`dfigures.  The thick woolen carpet covered in a very elaborate floral
pattern adds splashes of green, red, purple, and gold across the entire
room.  `dThe strong smells of both bitter and sweet tobaccos mix curiously
with the faint, yet `dinsistent floral and herbal scents of the perfumes
drifting down from the balcony above.  `dDark red carpet lines the
intricately carved staircase leading up to the balcony.

Rogues' Harbor``~
Here below the untamed wilds of the Forest lies a hidden retreat, a refuge from the rigors of the world.  There is a very soothing feel about this place, and you feel that you can relax without fear.
A small fire crackles in a carefully-arranged firepit, the gentle scent of burnt oak wafting through the air.  You can tell this place is used often, but effort is taken to keep it somewhat neat.
On the west wall hangs a hand-carved wooded `nsign.

Center of the Raging Storm``~
Dark thunderheads billow here, swirling about you and obscuring your
vision.  You have stepped into a bank of stormclouds, and nature's fury
rages about you in an awesome display of raw power.  Black wisps of mist
form the only walls here, and if there is a floor beneath you, you certainly
cannot see it.  The air crackles with electricity, tiny sparks of lightning
that flash into and out of existence in the space between heartbeats.  The
metallic tang of ozone invades your nostrils as the electricity makes your
hair stand on end.  Powerful gusts of wind support you, buffeting you
slightly but doing no real damage.  In fact, with a little practice it's
possible to maneuver around.  There's even a slight break in the clouds
just above you, and with one or two good gusts you could make it.

Walking Through the Clouds``~
Sunlight filters softly though the clouds here, providing a uniform
lighting with no discernable source.  In fact, clouds are all you can see:
thick white clouds dancing on a backdrop of blue sky.  The larger clouds
float majestically across the heavens, while the smaller ones dance and
play in slow motion.  Beneath your feet is a mat of thick white cumulus
that yields slightly, but somehow manages to support your weight.  Strong
winds gust out of a dark gap in the clouds near your feet, leading to a
stormy region below.  To the west you can see the sunlight glittering
beautifully, reflected in ten thousand directions off of a great crystalline
hall.  It is constructed seamlessly from whitish blue crystal, with
seemingly no faults or seams to mar its surface.  Giant spires rise up to
meet blue firmament as if supporting the skies above.  There is a slight
translucency to the hall, allowing the walls to catch and hold sunlight
without revealing what lies within.

The Crystalline Hall of Clan Advocation``~
The glow of the hall is startling at first, at least until your eyes adjust. 
The walls, ceiling, and floor are made of a pale blue crystal shot with
white streaks that catches the sunlight without and transmits it within,
filtering and mollifying the sun's harsh glare into a soft blue glow.  There
are no shadows here, since light filters in from all directions.  In the
center of the room there is a beautiful white crystal fountain that murmurs
peacefully in the background as it froths and foams.  Upon closer
inspection, the crystal material that forms the hall is revealed for what
it is: ice coalesced from the moisture in the air and given structure by
mighty magics.  Despite the icy nature of the hall, the atmosphere is quite
comfortable and the walls, merely a little cool to the touch.  Doors to the
north and south lead to work rooms, while a long corridor lies to the west.
A delicate spiral staircase on one side of the hall winds upwards.

The Shrine to Virtue``~
This is a small room, at the top of a winding staircase in a tower of Clan
Advocation's great hall.  The walls are thinner here than elsewhere in the
hall, and perfectly clear, providing an undistorted panoramic view of the
skies.  Clouds drift by so close you can almost feel their breezy touch,
obscuring any view of the hall below.  In the center of the room is a
simple altar of white marble.  The word Virtue has been inscribed on the
altar in the human, elvish, and syvin languages.  This is a holy place,
dedicated to the concept that righteousness is its own eternal reward. 
Were it not for the unassuming staircase leading down, you could almost
assume that this place is all there is of the world, and be content.

Advocation's Armory``~
It might seem strange that a clan devoted to helping others would need a
room such as this one, and perhaps it is.  You stand in Clan Advocation's
Armory, a room with dark blue crystalline walls lit by four small spheres
of faerie fire placed on the walls in each of the cardinal directions.  Under
each of the lights is a piece of ornamental equipment: two shields, and
two sets of wings indicating the priorities of Clan Advocation.  A box
with equipment is bolted to the floor on the south end of the room, with
equipment for use by clan members, and lesser gear to be freely
distributed to those in need.

Solitaire's Personal Room and Study``~
In contrast to the rest of the hall, this room has a warm, almost homey 
feel to it.  It is constructed out of a richly textured stone, with a 
deep carpet on the floor and rich tapestries adorning the walls.  The 
light is filtered through colored glass, which cuts the harshness of 
direct sunlight as it streams in.  In the evenings, the room is lit by 
various candles, and a cheerful fireplace.  As a well stocked bookshelf 
occupies one entire wall, it would seem that the occupant must spend much
time reading, or engaged in similarly academic pursuits.

`oFreedom Rising````~
The soaring walls seem like carefully-pruned hedges between massive
aspens and oak trees.  Above, the ceiling appears more a forest canopy than
a work of the hands.  Natural colors blend and shimmer to give greater depth
to this soaring hall.  You almost forget you are indoors, and you wouldn't
stained-glass windows in the ceiling, reaching the flagstone floor like tiny
be surprised if a leaf or two landed at your feet.  Daylight filters through
rays of gold.  At night, starlight and moonlight glimmer like silver fingers
The wind, when it blows, wafts through carefully-placed openings to provide
a soothing song.

The door opens and revealed is a journey into the elven heart.  Twin
columns of aspens and oak trees stand as central pillars.  The ceiling, a
delicate thatchwork, is suspended among the lower branches.  A gentle scent
of flowers and natural fragrance reminds you of a forest in spring, the
soothing musk easing the weariness from your muscles.  The distant notes of
an ethereal flute carry on an endless melody, blending perfectly with the
natural harmony about you.  No stone or tile is laid into the floor. 
Indeed, it is a rich lawn, green and luxuriant.  A narrow path leads deeper
into the room.

Advocation's Library``~
`cBookshelves line two walls of this room, filled with rare and precious 
tomes from across the lands of Exodus.  The other wall facing the door holds
artists' renderings of the various cities, towers, and wild areas of this 
world, while the near wall is studiously blank.  A lone window looks out 
over the clouds, and allows sunlight to filter through on bright days.
This is the library of Clan Advocation, where clan members may go to study
or meditate.  There are tables and chairs available here for any who wish
to tarry, with quills, ink, and paper available upon request.  In addition,
a number of `ibooks `care available for perusal.

The Passive Nature of Strength
 by Unti Vorvoral
   
 My personal search has led me far afield and it is good to finally come
 home. As many of you know, I stated life on a definitely shaky
 footing. With the help of spiritual and temporal guides, I have now
 reached an equilibrium well suited to me.
   
 Strength can be measured in many ways and none can be said to be any 
 less or more valid than any other. My personal measure of strength is 
 that pertaining to strength of character and strength of resolve.
 Basically, I have chosen to walk one path and will not be diverted from 
 this path as long as I shall live.
   
 I have accepted and embraced three key resolutions by which I live:
 To do no harm.
 To attempt to resolve conflict through dialogue
 To attempt to convince others that Passivism is a valid and desirable code of
 living.
   
 Doing No Harm:
   
 As a youth I believed, as most youths do, that strength of a physical
 nature was a paramount strength. It is easily recognized that pain or
 humiliation are never pleasurable. It is also easily recognized that
 all creatures have basic primal instincts to defend themselves. The
 realization of the truth of the two previous statements lends to an 
 understanding of why any given individual would defend themselves in
 the direct manner of the physical. The least thought is required to 
 lash out and wound the thing or individual that has harmed oneself.
   
 As I have walked my path, I have come to the realization that the
 easiest solution to any given problem is not necessarily the best
 solution to that problem. Deep thought is needed to find lasting 
 solutions. After deep thought on the issues of harm, I have come to the 
 conclusion that by harming others, I also harm myself. I understand 
 that some might find this hard to understand so I will try to elaborate.
   
 There are several reasons that harming others is actually harming
 oneself. I have listed four below and although this list is not
 complete, I feel it does give some sort of illustration of my point of
 view. I have listed them thus:
 If one confronts an antagonist on a one on one footing, there is a 
 possible chance of resolution. When larger groups of individuals are
 involved, such as Associations, Gangs, and Clans, then there is a very
 real potential to inflame the situation. If one's group of associates
 is smaller than the group of the opposition, real trouble can result.
 As the scale of any given altercation grows, individuals innocent of the 
 original action inevitably are dragged into the conflict. This is 
 never desirable, as the measure of harm in these cases has grown 
 exponentially in all cases.
    
 The authorities take a dim view of public acts of violence. To commit 
 any aggressive action against another will no doubt bring down their 
 wrath. The authorities inevitably engage in acts of violence in the 
 apprehension of perceived felons and thus the harm done is compounded
 once again.
  
 I come to my last example. I feel this is the paramount reason for not
 engaging in a physically violent act. It is my firm belief that as a
 pacifist, I harm myself when I harm others. This harm is not physical 
 in nature. It strikes somewhere very different indeed. It harms the
 mind and it harms the soul. I will not say that I have never committed
 a violent act. I will say that every one of those acts I now regret.
 Some are years past, but I still feel the pain as if it were yesterday.
 When the soul bleeds, it is almost impossible to staunch the flow from
 that wound.
   
 While the avoidance of violent acts is my desire and I strive towards
 the goal of a totally nonviolent existence, I also realize that not all
 individuals can live fully by this code. One has to balance the harm
 done one by the initial assault on oneself against the harm of not
 acting to correct the situation. Sometimes a direct physical reaction 
 is needed. In these cases, I urge those persons who arrive at the 
 decision to retaliate to arrive there after a great deal of thought.
 Weigh and balance your options and the harm you will do to both 
 opponent and self when you act. Never act from rage and never act
 rashly. Travel the path which results in the least harm for all.

E
objections~
In this volume, some of the more common objections to proceedings can be
 found. They are in no way a complete list, but they are applicable in
 this Court.
  
 Badgering a witness - Questioning a witness to harrass or degrade, while not
       moving toward any possible goal.
  
 Leading a witness - Questioning a witness in a way that leads in only ONE
       possible direction. 
  
 Hearsay - Any secondhand knowledge. This is non-admissable. All witness
       testimony must be in the firsthand.
  
 Speculation - No question may be asked for which a witness must draw a
       conclusion or give opinion. (There will be no "expert witness"
       testimony in the Courts of Exodus)
  
 Relevancy - A barrister may challenge the relation of the questioning of
       the witness to the matter at hand. 
  
 Admissability - A barrister may challenge the allowance into the Court of
       any piece of evidence or testimony.
   
 Vague or Compound Question - All questions must be asked in a manner which
       is specific and calls for a single answer. 
    
 Lack of Foundation - A line of questioning must be built in such a fashion
       that a question has a basis for being asked. In the same manner, it is
       not allowable to ask questions that deal with non-admissible evidence.
~
E
procedure~
The Court of Exodus expects any Barrister who will practice law in the court
 to follow the poceedure set forth in this manual. There will be penalties for
 participants who do not adhere to the following:
  
 1) Submittal of a witness list - Prior to the trial, witnesses, if any, will be
     passed between Barristers with the presiding Judge present. There will be
     a short length of time for the opposing Barrrister to depose a witness.
     The defendant may not be deposed.
  
 2) Jury Selection - Prior to the trial, a jury of five (5) will be selected.
     No clan members of the defendant will be permitted on the jury, but the
     jury will be selected at random. The prosecution may dismiss one (1)
     juror, while the defense may dismiss two (2). Replacements are random.
  
 3) Pre-Trial Motions - These will be heard at this time.
  
 4) Opening Arguments - Prosecution will begin and defense follows. Basically,
     the Court will only wish to hear WHAT will be presented in the case. Some
     latitude will be given for suppostion...but not much.
  
 5) Case for the Prosecution - Presentation of witnesses and evidence with
     cross-examination of any witnesses.
  
 6) Case for the Defense - Presentation of witnesses and evidence with cross-
     examination of any witnesses.
  
 NOTE: The ONLY persons speaking in the court during the presentation of cases
     will be the BARRISTER, WITNESS, and JUDGE. The opposing barrister may
     make objections, but the rest of the courtroom will be SILENT.
  
 7) Closing Arguments - Prosecution followed by Defense.
  
 8) Jury Sequester and Deliberations - court will be recessed.
  
 9) Jury Finding and Sentencing - court will remain in session until dismissal.

The Reputable Stiletto``~
This room is a smooth opening in the trunk of this enormous old tree.  It
looks entirely natural, as well, as if the tree knew of the fine caliber of
the goods that would be sold here, and opened itself to permit the syvin
proprietor entry.  Underfoot, colorful rugs from the City of the Sun cover
the wood floor and protect it from visitors' shoes, and along the west wall,
a variety of weapons, armor, and other assorted goods are tidily displayed. 
Along the other three walls, however, you see the true pride and joy of this
shop: Stilettoes.  Hundreds of those elegant yet functional weapons are
displayed about the room in a truly impressive show.  A curtain covers a
small door, the frame decorated with the intricate carvings of the syvin
people, though the focus of these carvings seems to be, surprisingly enough,
stilettoes.

stiletto~
Gleaming metal against the dark wood of the tree, each stiletto has been
lovingly polished, cleaned, and mounted on the wall in patterns simple, yet
elegant, and thoroughly syvin.  Some of the stilettoes glow with the
unmistakeable tinge of magic, while others, less magical, have only the
solid, trustworthy look of fine metal.  Truly, this is an impressive
collection of stilettoes!

`cAmong the Branches````~
A breeze, carrying with it the scents of the ancient Forest Fierense,
streams through the branches of this gigantic tree.  To the south, you can
see the Valasse Trade Route winding off into the trees, and eventually to
the Harrissahne Drylands, just barely visible from this vantage point. 
Below this branch, a small pond nestles amongst the roots of this tree, the
gleaming silver forms of fish just barely visible.  The arched doorway to
the north leads back into Esperanza's store, and has been framed by a
variety of fishing gear.

This small alcove is just off the main shop, and is dimly lit by magical
sconces, that seem to hold within them small lightning storms.  The only
spot of color in this room comes from the stilettoes, tastefully spotlighted
on one wall, gleaming silver against the darkness, and glowing with the
brilliant light of magic.

This wee room off the main room of the Reputable Stiletto clearly
showcases only one product: the stilettoes displayed along the walls in
careful, exotic patterns with meanings only to syvins, or perhaps only to
one particular syvin.  Along with the soft glow of light from the wall
sconces, which seem to have tiny firestorms entrapped in crystal globes, the
room is lit by the gentle light of magic emanating from the stilettoes.

Solitaire's Thesden Law Office``~
The interior of this room is rather sparsely furnished.  There is a desk,
a few chairs, and a locked cabinet containing legal documents.  Just about
the only thing interesting in the room is its source of light: four globes,
each containing a tiny storm of white fire, illuminate the area.
  An engraved bar of metal on the desk proclaims this to be the office of
Solitaire Wind Rider, and his law degree is hanging on the wall behind
the desk.

A Musty Storage Shed``~
This room is filled with broken barrels and moldering crates. It is an old wharehouse owned by the Merchants Guild. It obviously has not been used in many years. Thick dust and spiderwebs are everywhere.
   A large family of bats live in the rafters and screech through the air when you disturb their rest. You doubt you will find anything interesting in this forgotten and forlorn place.

`dA Shallow `aDugout, `csurrounded by a `jSparsley Populated Plot````~
`c  As you wander north off of `oAnvil Street, you `bstumble into a 
`jshabby plot of land.  `hSmall tufts of `dslowly browning grass 
`crandomly dot the otherwise `abarren and rocky plot.  `aA small 
`ysign `coff to the side bears the `imark of Lotharian, `cclaiming this 
`csite as his own.  One of the only two discernable features of the plot 
`cis a rather `dlarge hole `cin the center of the claim.  The `dhole `cseems 
`cto `gflatten out on the bottom,`c and you get the feeling it is covering

The Boatroom``~
This large, dark chamber once was used for the storage of medium-sized
watercraft and also as a dry-dock when repairs were necessary.  When the
river lowered many decades ago and this room could no longer service the
craft that once could sail the river, it fell into disuse, was sealed up and
became long forgotton.  A pair of upside-down wooden arches, covered with
dust, sit unused, next to the stone dock in the southern portion of this
large, dim room.  Several pairs of block and tackle hang above the wooden
frame.  On the inverted arch-frame, a craft could be balanced and worked
upon.  The boats serviced here sailed through the eastern opening of the
room where several thick, rusting, iron bars now stand to block the way. 
Only a couple of feet of the polluted water from the Severn River lap up
against the stone dock in the southern portion of the room.  Three creaky
and warped wooden steps lead up and into the room to the north.

climbed down the steel rungs built into the stone dock to the north here,
you stand knee-deep in the cold, smelly water.  ``

The Boat Builder's Chambers``~
This small room was the office and bedroom of the man responsible for building
and repairing the small cargo vessels that once sailed the Severn.  Underneath the
pier, and built into the anchorage, this room is the northernmost room of the repair
complex.  A small, thick-paned window built into the northern wall looks out into the
shadows underneath the pier, which leads out into the river.

You glace around and see pictures of the old ones at work conspiring to
annihilate the world, which worked well.  At one table sit Vistram, Cailet, and
Ragnar, 2 immortals and one near immortal discussing their plans.  At another 
table you see Salman, Harris, and Autrin discussing their bard plans.  At yet
another table you see the evil Kryndor convincing everyone how to kill even
heros.  You sit down at one of the vacant tables and wait for others to come
to help you continue in the everlasting war of the Revolution.

Vials litter the floor everywhere.  You see a picture of the smiling Flanch,
the current leader of the Ram Brakka.  You realize he's only leader of the Ram
Brakka because he's not good enough to be a great pk'er, but you notice that he
has helped the clan greatly.  There is a mat on the left where other Ram Brakka
are spending their free time meditating, preparing for more work.

`bThe `iRoom `bof `ithe `bRemorseless````~
`aThis room has been hollowed out of the sheer side of the Rayaicar
Mountains by the magic of the `bSidhe `amage `iEleithel`a.  Tokens of his
utter dominance over the smaller, mindless races of Thesden abound.  Buyer
copies of death contracts made with the other evil races (who are little
better than the rest) abound, literally plastering the one window that looks
outward. The northern corner of this room is filled with small candles, each
representing one of the paltry lives that `iEleithel `acares nothing about. 
Each candle has a name written on it in gold, with the ones labelled 'Logain'
'Crazed', and 'Lauras' snuffed out.

Super Secret Entrance``~
You enter a well-furnished room, which is a nice escape from the barren landscape
of the desert above.  You notice a contraption in the corner that constantly hums
as it sucks all the sand then enters the room and blows it back into the desert.
You are amazed at the array of couches, sofas, and chairs that reside in the room
to comfort the weary travelers who have made the treck to this mall.  You can't
wait to see what treasure's lie waiting for buyers inside this megamall.

hideout for those Revolutionaries who wished not to be found or who wished for a

You enter the first room of the mall, and all around you there are coils.  Only
coils.  Here lies `hAn Extremely Long `iCoil `hof `lBlue `hEnergy``, there lies `hAn Extremely

`hImmediately upon entering the room you notice that this place greatly
differs in design and architecture from the rest of the clan hall.  This
high-ceilinged, columned room has walls, columns and a floor of pure
alabaster.  The domed ceiling high above has an abstract design of a jhereg
done in gold leaf.  An exit leads to the south, where through a narrow
hallway, one can read in the Jhereg library.  Northward, stands a doorway
with columns standing on each side of it as sentries would stand beside a
door.  Above the door, enscribed in silver, is the word 'Private', written
in the distinctive spidery runes of the language of magic.  ``

In sharp contrast to the wide-open meeting chamber to the south, this room appears
tiny and snug.  Shelves filled with books of every size, shape and color, are set into
the oaken walls, making the room appear to be lined in paper and leather rather than wood.
Upon a casual perusal of the many worn tomes and volumes upon the shelves, one soon
learns that the only thing each has in common is the subject of magic.
 
An oval shaped desk made from the cross-section of a great old tree sits in the center
of the room, with a high-backed leather chair behind it.  Nearby in the corner of
the room stands a shoulder-high perch which is scarred with claw marks.  A doorway
to the east leads to a dimly lit room from where flickering candlelight can be seen.
Strange symbols and inscriptions are written on the doorposts and above the door.

Sun has fled.  Moon failed.  Stars wink away one by one.  Only the lights of intellect
and power remain.  Silence envelops, joining the darkness.  The only stirring is the
faint motion of air, the memory of soft wings and the fading vibration of ancient spells.
 
A giant rune of un-warding has been made in the center of the floor of this small, 
dark, square chamber.  The symbol, used to remove spells of warding, is made from
sea-salt sprinkled on the hard stone floor.  Shadows waver across the walls and floor

At the bottom of a pit``~
Centuries of erosion formed this chasm, deep within the earth.  You
can still hear the steady drip of underground water falling drop by
precious drop from some ancient stalagtite to the hard stone floor.
There is no light here, unless it comes from an opening far, far above,
where a natural sinkhole left a scar in the wastes above.  There's no
way to reach the sinkhole unless one can climb up a sheer rockface ...
or fly.  Compounding matters, someone seems to have bolted a door of
sorts over the sinkhole, though it was cleverly concealed from the
surface.  Various bones litter the floor, suggesting that something
wicked just might dwell nearby.

A small alcove``~
This is a small, natural alcove to a large chasm, deep below the
surface of the earth.  There is no sound down here save the soft drip
of water onto rock: steady and unceasing, it is enough to drive one
to madness.  Perhaps the one who lives here likes it that way, for it is
instantly obvious that someone dwells here.  Racks of weapons and
armor, lit by a cold magical fire, line the walls, and somehow elegent
furnishings have been carved from the stone.  Blood has been quite
liberally splashed on the floor and walls of this place, however, and
some of it is very fresh.  There is the strangest feeling that the
owner does not consider this to detract from the coziness of the
alcove, but rather to serve as decor ...

`kThe `dUnderground `kChOcObO's Stable``~
`kAs you walk into this underground Chocobo stable you think you hear a
quaint WARK in the distance.  You really cant tell though because of the
freshly layed straw makes a crunching sound as you step through the stable. 
As you reach the back of the stable a very large golden chocobo stands there
eating food from a very large trough.  When you go up to pet the Chocobo you
notice it has a collar on it.  You walk up to the Chocobo's pen and read the
name off of the nameplate it says `dL`ca`du`cr`da`cs `dt`ch`de
`cC`dh`co`dc`co`db`co`k.

`dThe Balcony on the `cTreetops````~
This sturdy hard-wood balcony is attached firmly to the curving outer
wall of this massive tower.  A black wrought-iron railing encircles the
smooth decking about waist high.  The floor of this balcony rests right on
the tops of the trees of the forest below.  Parts of the Great City of
Thesdan can be seen off to the east.

`nAs you walk into this small room a heavy mist envelops you.  A small
crackling sound and a `iwarm glow `ncome from further east `nYou look south
and you see a small aquifer with a `aDank cave `nbehind it you think you
hear a noise from behind it.  `nYou walk around in the calm waters for a bit
and feel strangly at peace.  You exit the water and sit on the `dGlittering
white sand `nsorrounding the aquifer.  It is quite comfortable `nYou wiggle
your feet in the aquifer and notice a few large `kChocobo's `ndrinking from
the aquifers crystal clear water `nAs you watch the Chocobo's eat the greens
left out by the master and drink from the cold water you feel a sense of
`nbeauty from theese strange creatures it almost wants to make you laugh.

`oYou step into this room and already you feel better.  There is
something very special and magical about the space within these walls.  You
can not put your finger on it, but there seems to be a strange feeling of
tranquility in this room that makes your spirit at peace.  You feel as if
you could stay here for hours, for with that peace, comes an elite feeling
of health and magical powers.  You look around and notice other members
here, resting and relaxing.  ``

secure enough that no one can find or harm you.

`lA `aDark `lLair````~
The transition from the despair and death of the poor end of
Weincloudstan City to this is rather shocking.  Gilglin has taken advantage
of the rocky bones of the mountains that surround this place to create a
lair of his own.  Spiring up from the ground, the ceiling here is lost in
the dimness above.  Designed in an open construction, the few load bearing
pillars here have been faced with some dark , oily looking wood, obviously
imported from some warm, savage, clime.  The only decoration is a small sign
hanging on the wall, with some words in the Sidhe language burned into it, a
large desk, seemingly formed straight from the stone of the floor, and one
white oak chair, straight backed, and padded in green velvet.

PICKPROOF NOBASH up - Original - `aAboard the sunken vessel named `h'`nBythos`h'``~
`aYou're standing on the deck of a sunken ship.  Resting on the floorboards 
`ais a chunk of `dwood`a from the hull, declaring the name of this boat to be '`nBythos`a'.
  `aThe entire deck is covered in `hbarnacles`a, `dsand`a and `cseaweed`a, making the whole
`aatmosphere quite creepy.  Looking up, you can see the mast has been severed neatly in 
`ahalf.  The tip of the top half is resting against the deck, so that it makes a 
`aclever triangle.  The pulleys and riggings that once held a giant sail up, are 
`anow hanging awkwardly from the cargo nets and pieces of split timber.  There 
`ais a net anchored to the deck with an eyehook, and strung up to a pulley on 
`athe mainmast. There's a gaping hole in the deck, presumably leading to the lower
`adecks and ocean floor.``

A quiet corridor in Advocation's Hall``~
This is a quiet corridor in Clan Advocation's Hall.  Here, many clan members
have their personal places where they go to rest, study, or meditate.  The
walls here, though made of crystal, are dark compared to the main hall.  The
floor is covered with a soft, plush carpet that muffles one's footfalls quite
well.  The corridor continues on to the west, and the great crystalline hall
is just to the east.  To the north and south are closed doors.

`lHeaven's Refuge````~
Perhaps Heaven had a change of heart...  Who can fathom the mind of that
great mage?  The torture devices, so prevalent earlier, have been replaced
as if by magic.  A great seal has been placed over the eastern door, with an
ancient motto inscribed upon it.  Plush, black carpeting has been installed
over the cold, hard ground.  A dark red, heavily carved desk sits in one
corner, just in front of a rack of dusty equipment.  Obviously, some of it
is for sale, but some of it seems to be lovingly polished every day by the
master herself.

`hYou step to the edge of the hallway and are now outside!  The hallway
turns into a elaborate glass patio, though.  Not only is the scenery
beautiful, but it smells great!  The sea breeze is comfertable and makes you
feel all 'tingly'!  It probably helps that your boozed up from that good ale,
but...  SHHH!!  You look into the crystal clear waters below you and.... 
MMM-HMMM!!  Theres those Nekkid chicks again!!!  ALL RIGHT!!!  Well, thats
enough looking, time to DIVE IN BABY!!  YEE-HAA!!  ``

`kA quiet corridor in Advocation's Hall``~
This is a quiet corridor in Clan Advocation's Hall.  Here, many clan members
have their personal places where they go to rest, study, or meditate.  The
walls here, though made of crystal, are dark compared to the main hall.  The
floor is covered with a soft, plush carpet that muffles one's footfalls quite
well.  The corridor continues on to the west, and the great crystalline hall
is just to the east.  To the north and south are closed doors.

The Entrance Of Life And The Ending Of Death``~
As you enter this room you realize that it has a very relaxed setting
that makes you feel like just sitting back and relaxing.  You see that not
many people have entered this room.  And you can tell by the way it looks
that it is no place to fight.  A table in the corner tells you that this was
made for one person and no more than that.

The Room of Regeneration~
As you enter this room you are filled with the scent a beer.  You look
around to see what smells so good and you see a book From the book ale pours
out of it.  You try pick it up but are stoped by the fact that it wieghs
1000000 pounds.  Oh well time to get drunk!

Master Bedroom of Lady Purity.``~
Upon entering this beautiful room you see a huge wall that changes
scenes.  This is the bedroom of the humble Mistress of the house.  Although
this room looks very huge it doesn't take you long to run into the bed. 
This room is completely filled with candles.

Swimming room``~
As you enter this you feel the urge to rem all your clothing.  As you
scan around the first thing you see is a large pool size hot tub in the
center of the room.  It looks as if it has been used very little and there
is a sign in the front.  It reads: Feel free to take a swim.  You can barley
supress the urge to jump in at this very second.  So don't just stand there
jump in!!

PICKPROOF NOBASH original name: `eTigerwoman's`j Living Room``~
`cThis room slightly reminds you of `jhome `cas you make your way over to the
soft `jCouch full of `mPotpourri `cin the corner.  As you look up, you can see a
large `osky light `c, opening the room up to the forest outside.  On the
`ceast and west walls, you awe at two massive `js`it`ka`li`mn`ne`od `ig`jl`ka`ls`ms
`owindows `c, the one on the east potraying the `keastern plains `c, and the one on
the west portraying the `jforest `c.  The walls are made of `doak `c, and you can
catch the faint whiff of `dcedar `ccoming from the room to the north.  The room
almost seems to be telling you to `mmake yourself at home `c.

`cAs you enter this `kbrightly lit `croom, the smell of `dcedar `cfills
your nostrils as you make your way over to the `mfront counter `c.  As
you turn around, checking out your surroundings, you notice that almost all
of the wall space is covered in `oglass casing `cfull of a wide variety of
items.  You can just barely make out a `owindow `cto you east because of all the
goods piled neatly around it.  You then understand why the room smells of
`dcedar `c: the walls are make of it.  Before you have time to fully grasp
your surroundings, `eTigerwoman `chas moved behind the `mcounter `c, and has
asked you what you would like to purchase.

away from the pit, is a small natural looking fountain, full of `dale `c!

Temple of Shadows``~
`lThis room is cloaked in darkness.  As your eyes adjust, you begin to see the details of the tomblike room around you.
Long black silk streamers adorn the walls, rippling in the slight breeze that seems to ome from nowhere.  There
are no windows, and the hallway behind you is dead calm.  A large bronze altar is centered on the north wall, 
covered in an obscure runescript that looks to be written in blood.  Sconces are on every wall, and the musky scent
of the incense that burns in them perfumes the air.  Weapons an other trinkets lie on the altar, a gift to some unknown 
or unspoken god, and gold, piled like sand, glitters dimly in the available light from the doorway.  You dare to
venture further into the room, and a cold breeze caresses your face like a lovers touch.  Suddenly fearful, you 
would swear later that the shadows themselves seem to point accusingly at you, as if you had in some way trespassed
on their respite from the light.  Now terrified, you turn to run, and come face to face with a man wrapped in darkness.
All that is visible are his eyes, which cut deeper into you than any knife could.  Stubling back, you quickly run
past him into the relative comfort of the dimly lit hallway.  Turning back to peer in, perhaps catch another glimpse
of the mysterious man, but you are greeted with the loud slam of a heavy wooden door closing on your prying eyes.

PICKPROOF NOBASH original name:`a The`b Vasty`a Hall of Death``~
`aThe stench and creeping decay that is so prevalent just a few feet
above becomes much more potent here, at its source.  Heaven has chosen this
despairing spot as a great hall, delving deep underground.  `aSandstone
`apillars sprout out of the death above like nightmare flowers in an unhappy
garden.  Each pillar is faced with a different type of rare, dark wood,
imported from ancient, long-forgotten realms.  The sheer scope of this
place, with all of its instruments of death and torture lovingly polished,
is enough to bring tears of joy to the eyes of any Sidhe.  Unfortunately, it
is more than enough to bring the contents of many a staunch stomach
splattering to the smooth floor.  `bRed `a`brunes`a light magically on the
far wall, and an ancient parchment with the word `l'Rules'`a in a flowing
script inscribes a small circle in the slightly musty air.  A list of
`cstores `aetched in green on the floor is here to act as a guide.

`bArcanum `iAd `bAeternam````~
This small shop caters to the needs of the mages of Thesden.  Dark
mahogany racks cover most of the bare walls, groaning under the weight of
bags and bottles and vials In the middle of the circular room sits a crystal
case, with a few of the choicer items within.  These rare items are
illumined by an unearthly glow radiating from a pair of `g`j`jjade`l`l````
`leyes that float near the ceiling.  A small archway to the west, carved
with inlaid roses of `iruby`l, `hdiamond`l, and `cemerald`l leads back to
the main selling floor.

`lThis `adusty `lshop is the home of Heaven's more physical equipment. 
Those who know they must brave the road ahead by main strength and force of
arms stop by this place first, knowing they can replenish their ability to
deal `bbloody `ldeath to the denizens of Thesden.  Two `dpolearms `l hang
crossed on a wall, right above an old, leather topped desk.  Small `ctrees
`l sit, neatly pruned in pots, in every corner of the establishment.  Each
weapon has a small `htag `lhanging off of it, elucidating its level of
enchantment.  To view each tag, simply type the weapon's name, with the
letters 'tag' on the end.  A `agranite obelisk`l stands in the middle of the
room, displaying a catalog of weapons that have tags.

`bThis room, unlike the rest, has a very relaxing atmosphere.  The coffee

seat, and maybe make some small talk.  I would write more interesting stuff,
but I'm not that inventive.  And I'm still pretty upset about losing my

latest husband, Fred.  Damn triggers.  The rest of this description will
most likely be filled with 'p her' There's nothing I can do about that.  My
throat aches for liquid refreshment.  I miss you, Fred.  Unfortunately, Fred
'accidently' died while he was being pushed off a cliff.  The bastard didn't
p her
like coconuts.  Who doesn't like coconuts?  Fucking triggers.  I quit!  Oh,

drawers open and spilling the smaller necklaces and rings that mages prize
so highly.  `lA mannequin rests in one corner, holding spare scraps of armor. 
The one thing that relieves the severity of this room is the brightly woven
rug, in the primary jewel tones, splayed across the floor.

`aA Fine `lbluish `amist begins to permeate this shop, its origin
obviously in some far-off room.  The vaguely warm mist seems almost alive,
as if some horiffic spirit had been shackled here long ago and left, to
prowl unceasingly and devour those who tresspassed.  Far off in the corners,
where the lone `halabaster `asconce cannot illumine, rest chests of
equipment, some with layers of dust on them, and some brightly polished.

`lDe `aExcidio `lThesdenium``~
`lDown on the second level of Heaven's warren, the place seems to be a
bit more...  Melancholy that that up above.  Stores become fewer and farther
between, and the chill and damp penetrate more.  The only thing
distinguishing this place from those up above is the small card table in one
corner, with a minature replica of the city plan of Thesden raised
precariously upon it.  `a`a`lUnfortunately`l, it is in `la state of disarray.  The
minature towers of `aCastle Dunluce`l have visible signs of decay, and almost
the entire top portion of the mage guild's tower seems to be about two or
three feet away from where it should be.  This rendition is either the work
of some potent, evil force, or a mad fever-dream, inscrutible to the
unwashed masses.

rack has small openings for wands, each neatly sorted into its own spot.

`aThis is the first room that Heaven tends to show visitors.  A deep
`bburgundy `acarpet slashed with `hwhite `aand `cgreen `acovers the floor
with deep softness.  Large canvas bustforms stand erect in a line down the
middle of the room.  The first one is full of life-extending gear, and is
appropriately named `i'Hpsuit'`a. The second is lethal and pointy, and has a
tag on it proclaiming `i'Damsuit'`a.  Perhaps a third or a fourth will be
added in the future, but for the moment, these suffice.

`aThe Torture Chamber````~
Dim light fills this musty chamber from torches along the walls.  Set around
the room are various torture devices used to punish the enemies of Parlous.
Along the western wall stands an open Iron Maiden dripping with blood from  its
last occupant.  In the center of the room a summoning circle is carved into the
stone floor to enhance the power of a wizard.  You can tell this room sees much
use, and is used for an insidious purpose.

`bYou enter this very large, rather empty room.  There are many things
around, furniture, instruments of destruction, and other neat toys, but the
huge size of the room makes it seem unfurnished.  There are practice dummies
and other tools around on stakes pounded into the dirt floor.  In the corner
of the room there is a slab of precisly carved shale with a large bed on top
of it, and the whole room is lit by unseen sources.  You gain a feeling of
respect, for you can tell how hard Kryn has trained in this room.  ``

`aBarely visible behind the greenery, granite `cwalls`a can be seen, the only openings are an `carchway`a to the north
`aand a rusty iron `cgate`a to the west. The flora of the garden is not unlike the wild outdoors, the chaos of nature,

`lStarChaser's `cLodge``~
`dAs you enter the lodge, you get a feeling of peace and tranquility. 
The room looks to be made of some wood that is strange to you and 
seems to have a `lBlue Aura `dabout it. Looking around, you see the roof is sloped,
 meeting the right wall, and a `oSkylight `dis perfectly positioned in the middle right 
of the ceiling. Directly below the `oSkylight `dis a wonderfully comfortable bed, which
 looks to be crafted out of a solid piece of wood, the same wood as the room.
On the bed is a blanket made of `nblue `dand `jgreen `cl`le`ja`nv`ce`ls`d.
As your gaze shifts to the far wall of the room, you see a wonderous `ifireplace `dwith
 a grand `amantle`d. In the `ifireplace `dis a roaring fire whose `nf`ll`na`lm`ne`ls `dare
`nblue `dfrom the `kheat`d. In the corner you see a beautiful `cwild `jg`cr`je`ce`jn `cplant
 `dhanging from the ceiling.

There is a jar `nand a towel ready for you to wash your hands and your feet.
Doors lead almost `neverywhere, but when they are touched, they seem to
disappear.  Pictures float everywhere, showing scenes of great battles and
heroic deeds done in centuries past.  One picture in the middle of the room
stands out most, an oil painting of a male creature, almost human, but also
almost elvish.  This person isn't like the half-elves of today, but rather,
he seems like he has all the strengths and none of the weaknesses of both
races.  The pictures continue to float about this large, almost empty room.

`kA branch of the corridor````~
`cThis is a quiet corridor in Clan Advocation's Hall.  Here, many clan members
have their personal places where they go to rest, study, or meditate.  The
walls here, though made of crystal, are dark compared to the main hall.  The
floor is covered with a soft, plush carpet that muffles one's footfalls quite
well.  Somehow, there seems to be a change in the nature of the room.  
To the west, you see a sliding glass door marked Biohazard.  To the east, 
there is a 20 feet high double door.  To the north, a small glimpse of light 
catches your attention.

deeper mysteries `cof the Earth below.  A cool, `agray`` `cfog from an unknown
source pervades th`cis place, dripping from the massed plant life and gently
subsuming those who enter into the pitch and substance `cof the natural world.
In one small rock alcove, a small upwelling `cof the `bBlood ```cof the
`iEarth`` `cis caught in an ornate golden bowl.  A small wooden figure `cof the
First, Al-Kamenzari rests before it, with serenity in h`cis eyes and two
fingers ritual`cistically pointed in a gesture `cof warning, for those who d`care
touch the `bBlood`` `care nearly all consumed by madness.  The everpresent `cfog
seems to guide those initiated into the great Mysteries `cof the One to a set
`cof stone steps carved in a spiral vertically down, into the gutrock `cof the

`cA Peaceful Retreat``~
`cThis haven protects the Priest Path of Greenwood from harm.  It also
serves the priests as a staging room for the ceremonies in the other room of
the complex.  There is rich soil on the floor, and it extends to the walls
and ceilings of this place.  Held there by syvin magics, it sustains a
tremendous amount of `iflowering `cplants.  Huge creepers of `mfig`c and
liana traverse the walls, and `kvanilla bean `corchids rest in cunningly
made pots hidden from view.  Rare `ifire lilies `c, found only in the
tropical jungles of Cove Island, distend from the moist ceiling.  Purple
`fwisteria`c trains along wooden stakes that reach from floor to ceiling. 
Tucked away in this wanton dryad lovliness is a small station for
preparations.  A small `dbronze`c stool rests is a fairly clear spot, where
some fragrant, low cropped `jmint`c grows in a small circle.  Atop this
stool, a small `gvase`c of flowers sits, as a meditation point.  These
flowers are changed every morning just so that `eJuliette`c can gaze upon
something slightly lovlier than she is.  An `airon`c hatstand also sits
there, which holds many beautifully colored, ornate `lm`ia`ls`ik`ls`c. 
These masks are the heart and soul of the secretive ceremonies of the syvin.
Perhaps you shall be lucky enough to witness one of them for yourself.

perimeter.  Perhaps they too were witness to the Act of Creation itself.  A
warmth radiates not only from the soil, but from a `kgolden `astatue of a
flowering tree standing in the center of the room.  Hanging in one corner,
framed by `bbloodred `arunes, is the ancient sword of Malik, traitor to all
Elves.  Such anguish is planted in that blade that to this day, no Ranger
can bear to approach is, and those that gaze upon its jagged blade weep
uncontrollably.  In a smaller circle set between the girth of the Tree and
the ring of stumps is a short obsidian table, with `kgilt`a runes deeply
engraved into its surface.  An ancient, worn tome rests in a hollow, with
shining lettering reading "Religion Amongst the Rangers".  This place is the
true heart and soul of the syvin people, and their final retreat.

`kHome of Xeroth and Lisara````~
As you enter this house the first thing you notice is the soft cream
colored walls.  The floor is tiled with marble.  In the center of the room
the white and yellow rose symbol of the clan Alliant is present.  There are
paintings lining the walls.  The one to the right of you is a oil painting
of the ocean.  It is so realistic you can almost smell the ocean breeze.  To
the left of you there is another oil painting of Xeroth sitting in a gazebo
with Lisara leaning back against him , his arms folded around her.  The
smiles you see on their faces are ones of love and happiness.  On the wall
straight ahead is a painting of the White Tower where the Alliant clan hall
is.  The tower rises above Thesden and is a magnificent sight to see.  There
is another door to the west of here leading to a bedroom.

`kXeroth and Lisara's bedroom````~
This room is painted exactly as the last.  The soft cream color soothes
your soul.  The floor here is carpeted though in an off white carpet.  A
four poster bed dominates the room.  A white down comforter and large fluffy
pillows adorn the bed.  White gauzy material hangs over the top.  There is a
large dresser with an oval mirror on top of it against one wall.  A small
lantern sits on top of the dresser and throws soft light all about.  There
is a picture of a meadow with flowers on one wall.  On the other is another
oil painting of Xeroth and Lisara together.  They are strolling hand in hand
down the beach thier bare feet in the surf.  Their hieght difference is
apparant here.  Xeroth's shoulder length silver hair compliments Lisara's
waist length light red hair.  They are the very picture of two people deeply
in love with one another.  You hate to intrude upon this room for it is very
much their own.

`kLost Temple of Ne'Shajh````~
`gVro'ath and Dwarf wall carvings tell of the ancient rituals performed in
this temple.  Priests would sacrifice slaves and captured soldiers to
Ne'Shajh here in order to bestow blessings on the Vro'ath armies.  Ancient
tales tell of an enormous temple built with huge granite stones but legend
has it the temple was lost over a thousand years ago when Ne'Shajh destroyed
the temple instead of allowing it to be captured by enemy armies.  Recently,
only by accident, did two faithful servants stumble upon a loose stone and
revealed the Lost Temple.  Is it an accident or a turn in the war?``

`kTemple Ruins````~
`dStepping gently down a fractured staircase you see huge stones and
pillars littered about this room.  The room appears to be an ancient Vro'ath
priest's private chamber.  A thick layer of mud covers the floor and
hundreds of books are strewn about the room.  Surprisingly, a glowing golden
fountain is untouched and still flows with red blood.  To the west is the
armory holding the rusted weapons of the temple guards.

Small clutters of books and other reading material lays about gathering
dust.  A hand carved clock rests on the mantlepiece, inlaid with beautiful
stones.  A large marble fireplace fits snugly into the corner, next to a
large pile of firewood, making an oakish smell eminate around the room.  A
large comfy chair plush with down, sits in front of a wonderfully crafted
mahogany table.  All in all this seems like a nice place to sit and talk
with a friend, or if need be, take shelter from weather for the night.

Some walls in this room is etched with `kquotes`c from the ancient rangers
who have laid the foundations of this clan.  Though many of their names have
been long forgotten, their legacy is always with this clan.  There are a few
areas in this room that allow the wind to blow through, and though it is
impossible it almost sounds like the ancients are speaking their words
through this place.  Listening closely, a single word almost seems to echo
through this room, it seems to whisper "`kHonor...`c"

`cGreen`dwood `gHallway``~
`cThis room is slightly smaller than the one below or above it.  The wood
is thicker on the inside of this part of the tree trunk.  There seems to be
some places in the walls that are slightly hollow, and others that are
thicker.  A quick glance shows that this is the part of the `gClan Hall`c
that relays all the secret messages that are sent from an individual clan
member to others, whether they are in the clan hall or not.  Nature created
this area perfectly to relay the calls that Green`dWood`c members use to
transmit messages across the entire realm.  The hollow spots and the thick
areas amplify the sounds in this very room (which is why those in the clan
hall can easily hear all the secret messages sent by clan members) and
relays them using the tree itself as an amplifier.

`cGreen`dWood `gHallway``~
`cThe tree continues high into the sky, from here, the top is still very
hard to see.  Though this room is on the inside of a tree, it has the shape
of a cube.  The walls were probably carved into this shape for an ancient
purpose that has been long forgotten.  There is a slight smell of smoke in
this room although there it is not from any external fire that can be seen. 
The smell is heavily in the walls.  Though the origins of this room are
unknown, the smell of smoke causes many to make assumptions as to what this
room was used for in the ancient days.

`cThis part of the tree use to be the old training room, before the new
one was built.  Though the Syvin women who tried to redecorate this room did
a good job, there as some signs of this room's ancient purpose.  Small
`dknicks`c and `dchips `cin the wood can be found throughout this entire
room.  In fact there are some cuts in the wood that are so deep that they
break through to the outside of the tree.  One such cut has some `gwords`c
etched next to it.  Though this room is full of contrasts from the fine
linens to the weapons marks, there is a great deal of character in this
room.

`cGreen`dWood `gHallway``~
`cThis part of the hallway follows the natural pattern of the tree.  The
inside walls have small `bpaintings`c hung on them.  Each painting portrays
scenes from battles of the past.  One wall has the word `kVictories`c
written high on it, while another wall has the word `kDefeats`c written on
it.  Under each word is a short quote that explains the reasoning behind the
paintings.  Though the top of this room is covered, there is a ladder that
leads to a small panel in the ceiling, which gives away the fact that this
use to be the last room in the hallway.  Since the stairs could not be cut
from the trunk of the tree, the ladder was placed in the wall to extend the
clan hall further up into the tree.

`hAft deck of `kThe Sea Dragon`h``~
`hYou stand on the aft deck of `kThe Sea Dragon`h.  The main deck continues westward
towards the front of the ship.  A large `bopening`h in the deck leads down into
what must be the cargo hold.  The main `bmast`h rises high above you, with a vast
network of ropes and riggings.  The sails are tied up since the ship is in port
and a `bgangplank`h stretches northward into the harbor.  Off to the southwest, you
can see the `bcave`h lead around a corner and out of sight.  The `bentrance`h must be in
that direction somewhere, although you can only see darkness.  The gentle lapping
of the waves against the ship create a hollow echo in the enclosure of this
gigantic cavern, broken only by the groaning of the ship, the voices of the
dockworkers, and the squeaking of the occasional bat overhead in the darkness.
Aside from the `btorches`h mounted along the dock and the hanging `blanterns`h on the
deck of the ship, you are surrounded by perpetual night.

`aBackroom``~
You enter a rather sketchy little building just north of the bridge. They told 
you it was a safe house but it looks more like a flophouse. There's a half eaten 
jelly donut sitting next to a probably cold cup of coffee. Exhausted, you flop 
down on the floor; it seemed cleaner than the bed.

`lThe private hallway of the `oBrothers````~
`gAs you enter this long hallway you notice that there are doors
branching off on many sides, each decorated in its own unique way.  Also on
the walls are plaques, paintings, and other fine pieces of craftsmanship
showing how rich and deep the clan is.  Different noises can be heard in all
directions, from sparring behind the doors, to laughter and clinking of mugs
to the south.  ``

`dKryn's storeroom of S`kT`dU`kF`dF````~
`dYou walk out of the training room into this large, open room, and to
your delight there seems to be a breeze coming from a hole etched THROUGH
the mountain to the top, where a speck of light can be seen.  Also around
the room are various trunks, shelves, and other furniture filled with Kryn's
spare weapons, armor, and other essentials.  A feeling of respect, and fear,
flows through you, knowing if you tried to steal anything, would mean
certain consequences.  ``

`kJuli and Kori's secret love making room!``~
As you leave the warm den behind you, you enter a long and narrow
hallway, carved from a single stone, long ago.  The boughs of the trees
twisted and wrought to create a living wall, stunningly beautiful, small
etchings depicting scenes of heroic battles long since forgotten.  Your
hollow footsteps on the floor make you feel very alone.  Slowly the hall
curves to the west revealing another chamber.  A bright light emits from the
room.

`eAs you step onto the hard stone floor from the chisled stairway you
notice a few tables scattered throughout the room, a long polished stone bar
to one side of it.  The room is warm, or at least comfertable, and you can
tell the mood is usually happy hear, cheers and laughter can be heard and
tales of battles won, or how someone achieved a certain battle scar are
always being told.  For the first time since you have arrived it feels as
though the weapon at your side shall remain there--for now.  ``

`oThe `lSilverst`h*`lr `nArmoury````~
`nThe `kTraining of the Blades`` `nwas the original storage facility for the
the weapons and armor aquired by Kryian.  However, this vetern warrior has
defeated many foes and has procured their weapons and armor.  His inventory
has grown to such a proportion that required him to build a room solely for
his arms.  This large room has weapon and armor racks all about the room,
neatly organized.  Against the north wall is a magically sealed display case
that contains Kryian's rarest prizes.``

`kKryian's Personal Study````~
`lAnother part of Kryian's expansion was to dedicate a room solely to
his study and war preparation. A collection of tomes neatly organized
on a large bookshelf that covers the west wall. Large desk sits on the
south end of the room with a large scroll case within reach behind it.
The most interesting part of this room is the large oak table against
the east wall. A piece of canvas is affixed on top of the table.
The canvas currenly displays a detailed map of thesden, but this
magical canvas can display any part of the world that is desired.
This helpful tool is used to plan various battles against his foes.``

`hThe `nHallway `hof the `eF`ao`er`ag`eo`at`et`ae`en````~
`a
Climbing down, the rooms darkness seems to close in.  Looking around you
see that two candles hanging upon the wall are the only sense of light being
shed.  The darkness seems to consume, neverending, it swallows everything
within the room, leaving little but flickering shadows of light from that
seem fight to servive in this barren place.  With almost calm serenity it
sings a dirge of nothingness.  Making it feel as if no longer are you among
the world once known.

The Dragon Slayer Weaponery``~
`nThis place is lit with candles scattered throughout the room. 
`lPictures`n of heroic deeds and great Paladins of past grace the walls. 
`nAs you look around you can't help but knowtice the rather large door that
leads `mdown`n, where loud snoreing, what seems to be from a `odragon`n
emmits.  You seem content not to make any loud noises as to wake it.  At the
end of the room some tables are decorated with different types of `jDragon
statues`n.  `nAnd a strange `iMinotuar`n statue seems to stand out.

`kSic Transit Gloria````~
`dThis room has multiple duties for the `iI`bc`ia`br`ia`bn`io`bs`d of
`cGreen`dWood.  Part `krespite`d from the outside world, part meditation
chamber, part shop, and part shrine to those memories he chooses to cling
to, this place is, like Rild, humble before the might of the `oCreator`d,
She who enfolds all of Creation.  The ovoid room is dominated by a groaning
bookshelf of `ateak`d, upon which lean learned tomes of ancient lore
collected by Rild himself and the others who came before him in the Scholar
path.  Names writ in faded `kgilt`d flash out dimly: `gKosmo SuVinitta`d,
`gLoric Vilesilencer`d, and `gCirdan the Traveller`d among them.  Here is a
great portion of the acquired learning of the Rangers, preserved inviolate
from the weathers of time and ignorance.  Atop the bookcase and scattered
around the room are strangely shaped cups of the purest `kgold`d, which hold
low-flickering candles, and throw organic shadows on the walls and ceiling. 
In one corner, there stands a low desk with a few small `ocrystalline`d
domes that seem to hold small arrangments of flowers in `cgreen`d and
`osilver`d and `kgold`d.  Another space is devoted to music, with an
enchanted piano tinkling out the binary arch of sound that is the `bGoldberg
Variations`d.  Scattered artifacts of Rild's past lives lie, some dust
covered, some highly polished, and most with small glass tags stating their
origin or significance.  Overall, this is a private place, one of beauty,
majesty, and magic.

`aShadowlust``~
A sudden wave of nausea washes over you as you enter this room, gravity
seeming to come from all directions at once without any order or pattern.
The disorientation is horrific as your body and mind attempt to make sense
of the absolute senselessness of this place.  The air, if you could call it
that as you choke and cough, is a flat gray, reminding you faintly of mist,
except that it seems alive, malevolent, watching your pathetic efforts to
stay sane and rational.  Random flashes of light and darkness appear to
come from all directions at once, always too fast for you to focus on.
Finally, after what seems like hours but must only be minutes, even seconds,
your fingers find a hard surface, a recognizable anchor in this flat, dead
chaos.  You struggle to get your feet onto this patch of solid ground, and
the insane gray fades, giving way to utter blackness...

`aA Secluded `eM`go`oo`hn`ol`gi`et `aCove````~
`g  `gAs you enter through the rough-hewn `as`oton`ae `gdoor, you are taken aback that such a
`gplace might exist in this world. Though it is broad daylight outside, the scene upon
`gwhich have entered is a beautiful ocean cove that is bathed in soft `emo`go`on`hl`oi`gg`eht`g. As the
`nw`ga`ov`ge`ns `glap slowly on the sandy shore, you can faintly hear the slow music of the Siren's
`gcall. Out of the side of the cliff drips a `ddark `gsappy liquid. At first you are wary of
`git, but as you taste a drop, you realize it is a sweet `kh`done`ky `km`dea`kd`g. On the beach to the
right sits a large `as`oton`ae `gtable, and two small `dreed `gmats to sit upon. The table has many
markings scratched into its surface, appearing to be songs, calculations, and numerous
enchantments and spells. One such mark catches your eye -- a small, simple celestial
symbol `i(`e(`d*`e)`i)`g. As you sit down and take in your surroundings, you feel at peace with the
`gworld. This is truly a place of tranquility in an otherwise hateful world.

`hAt the end of a long tube ride down through the `cslimy `dgate `hat the
bottom of the well, is a short, `brusted, `cmoss covered `bbridge `hthat
leads to an encircling patch of `fthick, purple-stemmed mushrooms`h with
`ablack, `bcrimson`o-`as`bp`ao`bt`at`be`ad `bc`aa`bp`as`h, so high they
graze the clouds.  A gentle breeze pricks the logged `if`ju`kn`lg`ma`nl
`os`ip`ko`lr`me`ns`h from their homes underneath the
`am`bu`as`bh`ar`bo`ao`bm`h-`at`bo`ap`bs`h and sends them swirling through
the sky to make their descent into the `as`co`dg`ag`cy `dd`ai`cr`dt`h.  In
the center of the growth is a `csticky, dark green fluid`h blanketed with
tiny bubbles that pop and hiss.  A haze of warmth can be seen rising off the
surface of the `cd`di`cs`de`ca`ds`ce `dr`ci`dd`cd`de`cn `cwater`h as it
flows onto the muddy banks that look like `ahot tar`h.  With each bubble
that bursts an unpleasant scent of mold and filth is released.  The fumes,
however, are somehow intoxicating, so much so that the various
unidentifiable creatures inhabiting the swamp roam about staggeringly, as if
lost in another realm.  There is a small camp ground set up around a
man-made extension.  The smallest of the mushrooms, only a few feet tall,
has sprouted between the murky `cwaters`h and the `abank`h.  There is a
`ksign`h posted on it, directly above a colorful patch of fuzz.

`aThe Silver Shrine````~
`dSeemingly the antithesis of the riotous plant life and heavy perfume,
this `aholy`d place is simple and elegant.  Low sounds of `lwater`d from a
nearby stream turn louder now, as it travels over rocks and down small
embankments to find its home in the great sea to the south.  Rising a few
feet on a few small slabs of stone, this place is a rest and respite for
weary travellers, and those who wish to hear and see the world as it once
was, away from the prying eyes and raucous voices of others.  The structure
itself seems to be made of a light, `asilvery`d wood, in places silvered
with leaf in whorls and subtle patterns reflecting the `cnature`d around the
place.  Small arches of silver wire frame the doorway to the east, where a
more subtle perfume and light seem to arise.  To the north is the `kHall of
Light`d, a holy place where penitents often gather to sing hymns to the
Creator on occasion.  `` `dFrom the south, the sounds of the wood flute,
fiddle, and cymbal somehow carry over the general din of loud conversation
and the intermittent crash of broken crockery.  The sign over the door
proclaims that the establishment is called `mThe Bishop's Garter`d, and the
sign holds true to that bizarre promise, showing a woodcut bishop (crook,
vestments and all) holding up the hem of his robe, showing what seems to be
a frilly, lacy band around his upper leg.  It's enough to make one vaguely
nauseous and suspicious, but the place does hold some interest for the
locals, evidently.  ``

`aT`oh`he `aM`hoo`an `cG`oa`ar`cd`oe`an````~
`cThis place is only opened when the ghostly `kmoon`c rides high in the
night air, providing its luminescence in soft, moderated beams.  The garden
itself was built hundreds of years ago, encompassing a master plan that is
now lost.  Dark green ivys and small trees grow here, no more than fifteen
feet high, and those are overlaid with night flowering plants, always with
blossoms of `hwhite`c or `kyellow`c.  The combined light of the moon and a
few strategically placed candles create a mesmerizing play of `asilvery`c
shadows to amuse lovers who can only come during these hours to pledge their
love.  Cunningly placed low `hwhite`c benches hide around many corners, with
soft padding that makes the long hours spent here feel like moments.  This
is a magical place, one infused with love's true sentiment.  `` `cOff in a
corner, a hammock is slung between two sycamore trees.  A voluptious young
woman sprawls lazily, in quiet repose.  She somehow seems familiar, but as
this place emanates a mischevious, magical quality, the very `igods`c
themselves may just be teasing you.  ``

`kThe Hall of Light````~
`dA stunningly pale expanse of wood and sky greets the eyes, binding
`cforest`d and `nsea`d.  Built around a central column, this octagonal room
stretches hundreds of feet before being enclosed by high-arched windows that
strive to let in every ray of light possible.  Satiny, polished `owhite`d
wood covers the floor, kept smooth by years of bare feet that traverse this
space to prayer in the morning, with the rising of the `ksun`d.  During most
of the day, there is little sound here, save the incessant drip of water
from a hidden hole high in the roof that marks the minutes as it falls into
a deep, echoing pool set in the floor.  The windows themselves are mostly
huge panes of clear glass (a rarity in these times where even kings must
shiver in the cruel knifing winds that slip through arrow slits in high
castle walls), but across the demilune arched top are set mosaic patterns of
colored glass in every vibrant `kc`jo`il`fo`lr`d known to the syvin,
compounded by the skill of the dwarves.  The panel that draws the most
reverence, as shown by the small `ipoppies`d and `firises`d that have been
left there show the angel `kMalrezni`d in Her radiant glory, piercing the
vile heretic mage `bAuvyron`d with a bolt of force.  Those deep in the
wisdom of the syvin understand this parable: The backward glance and
transfixed stare of the angel illustrate the need to know the past, and the
radiance surrounding Her is likewise the radiance of the Creator, She who
sustains us and enfolds us through every moment until the end of time.  Off
to the west, a small room with a low door seems to be a meditation or
preparation area for the monks who frequent this place.

malrezni~
`kA demigod in her own right, Malrezni chose to give up some of her
life-force to aid in the permanence of `bAuvyron's`k prison.  As his hate is
unbounded for those who would thwart his designs, `bAuvyron's`k first act
was to enchain this blissful spirit within the `apillar`k that until
recently housed his soul.  Only the weakening of `bAuvyron's`k spirit
allowed her to reach this plane, so what you can see is more dreamlike than
not.  She still has no form; just a presence: The majesty of a
`gs`at`eo`gr`am-`ei`gn`af`el`ga`am`ee`ad`k ocean, the peace of an old
churchyard, the love that the eternal `cForest`k feels for its Rangers. 
Malrezni encompasses those and more, and her light illumines the rooms of
your your soul.  ``

`cHidden High in a Tree````~
`d`l`d`eThe breeze at this height feels deliciously warm, caress`eing the body
and encourag`eing laughter and gaiety amongst all those `ewho come here.  Rich
scents of night bloom`eing jasm`eine, white rose and moonflower waft up,
delight`eing the senses.  `l`d`eThe room, if one could call it that (it is only a
room because it somewhat encloses a space), lives and breathes `ein witness to
the love of the wood and spirit of the world.  `cVerdant`d `enew spr`eing growth
has been tra`eined gently on gossamer `asilken`d `ecords `ein a w`eind`eing pattern,
effectively shield`eing `einhabitants from pry`eing eyes.  `l`d`eThe bower, then, takes
up most of the crown of an young holly that atta`eins perhaps twenty feet `ein
height before round`eing out `einto a spiky, `cgreen`d `efullness at the top. 
Inside, the pale yellow wood has been made to form low benches that have
been covered `ein jewel tones of silken fabric, `ein `fpurple`e, `kgold`e, and
`lblue`e. Huge, fluffy pillows dot the floor, mark`eing favored recl`ein`eing
spots.  The light comes from a blend of `cgreen`e and `osilver`e candles
that have been scattered to emphasize suggestive and playful shadows versus
shedd`eing any real light.  For `iShe`d `ewho sometimes chooses to dwell with`ein
needs the quiet seduction of the dark to th`eink and rest and nurture beauty
with`ein.  Iced dr`einks `ein beaten `kgold`d `egoblets rest on trays, with beads of
condensation mark`eing the temperature of the liquid `einside, `ein case someone
would like a refresh`eing dr`eink.  Even the sounds that reach this place have
been filtered through `idivine`e magic to only reveal that which is pleasing
or joyous: `l`d`eThe whispered poetry of love down below, the sweet sounds of
gentle `nrain`e in the forest, the gentle pleasings of a lute and a high
soprano voice s`eing`eing softly, the beat`eing of a lover's heart right next to
her own...  `l`d`eThese sounds come sigh`eing `ein on the warm, scented night air, all
to please her.``

`dThe Choir Room````~
`dThis prepatory room is panelled in the same, `klight`d wood as the
floor of the main room to the east.  A high chancel window to the west lets
in copious amounts of the late evening sun, warming the room enough to where
it smells slightly of sawdust.  A low, `astone`d bench rests against the
north wall, especially built to be slightly uncomfortable, lest the monks
here doze off for too long a time.  A half-empty oak cabinet stands slightly
open next to the bench, with a few brown robes stacked neatly to one side
and similar number of `cgreen`d sashes coiled on top.  Evidently, the monks
that form the choir are away parcticing...  Which now that it comes to mind,
you can hear ringing down into the room from somewhere up above.  A small
trapdoor can be seen cut into the ceiling, with a `asilvery`d button
seemingly hovering in midair below.

`dA crude wooden structure``~
At first glance, this appears to be a crude wooden structure
which creates a haven from the outside weather.  In actuality,
this is a carefully constructed wooden garage of some sorts, 
proven by the wheel ruts left on the western floor.  The lack
of sand in here proves that this was constructed for more than
simply shade.  Camel droppings are everywhere here, the stench
causing the desert wildlife to stear clear.

`mThe Bishop's `aGarter````~
`dThis long, low building is built into the side of a hill that, oddly
enough, is invisible from the outside.  `aDark`d, exposed wooden beams taken
from the surrounding forest line the ceiling, most blackened by years of
cooking soot, and some idly carved by passing adventurers.  The common room
is about fifteen yards in length, and has decent ventilation somehow,
without noticeable fans or magic to circulate the air, which is redolent
with the smells of cooking food, good wine, pipesmoke, and wood charring in
the fireplaces.  A dark wooden staircase climbs a narrow space in the
eastern corner, perhaps to some expensive, private rooms.  A earthen floor,
spattered here and there with ale stains, blood, and sawdust provides a
comfortable, if less than sanitary conditions.  A long bar, made from the
same wood as the high ceiling stands prominently in the western corner,
where the kitchen resides.  Some high-backed, curiously designed oaken
stools with `cgreen`d cushions sit around the bar in comfortable clusters,
inviting small groups to trade stories over pints of cool, dark beers. 
Perhaps one of the regulars might invite you over to hear the story of how
the tavern got its name.  Perhaps you'd like to settle in to one of the
chairs by the fire to think, absently patting the ample bottom of a passing
barmaid, who might give you the rough side of her tongue as recompense. 
There seem to be no other exits, so you might as well have a drink and relax
for a while.  ``

Overlooking the Sea``~
`dA gentle sea breeze drifts through the room, fluttering the mosquito
netting draped artfully around the bed.  Windchimes created from bamboo and
an assortment of seashells fill the air with a soothing song, mingling with
the crash of the waves upon the beach and the calls of animals from the
jungle in the distance.  Near the window, a long bench provides a place to
rest and contemplate the surrounding beauty.  ``

outside would indicate.  Vivid splashes of`m purple`f and`j green`f alternate in 
wide bright`m s`jt`mr`ji`mp`je`ms`f around the walls and the floor is covered in plush 
`mpurple`f carpet.  In the center of the vaulted ceiling hangs a dazzling, 
multicolored chandelier which refracts the light against the walls in 
brilliant prismatic patterns.  In the center of the wall opposite the door,
there is a large shield emblazoned with the clan colors and bearing the 
image of a rampant don--`n unicorn`f, a small`d plaque`f attached to the wall 
beneath it.  A bulletin board near the door, covered with miscellaneous 
scraps, pictures and notes, has a large`o note`f fastened in the center which 
looks very important.  To the east a sign has been posted on the door, 
`mDRIVERS ONLY!`f  , and to the west, a`m purple`f and`j green`f glass bead curtain 
leads into another section of the wagon.

`fIn the clan hall, you cannot quit in this room or the cockpit.  The only

It has to do with the fact that the rooms are mobile.  Keep this in mind.  
Quitting in this room and the cockpit may cause the mud to crash.

the front of the wagon where you see `mTurnip`f the donkey hooked to the wagon 
and eager to take you wherever in Thesden you desire.  The reigns which 
would put you in control of the wagon rest near a seat for the driver.  
Next to them is a thick `mmanual`f, it looks like a book of instructions.

and leaning to the left.  Named by `mLirawen`f, Turnip is a part of the

back and forth from the movement of the wagon can be heard from the corner 
where several barrells sit, dust settling on the lids.  The walls here are 
colored a similar green as the rest of the wagon, but otherwise they are
plain.  In one corner of the room, there is a small stack of `jpapers `cwhich

`mClan Hall Notes From Your Leader!
`fThe clan hall is far from finished, boys and girls!  I know that things 
look farely plain at the moment, I just wanted to get something up.  Over 
the days and weeks ahead, you will see many changes to this little wagon.
``
`fClan EQ is coming soon as will a fountain and some other things to look at 
and marvel at in the wagon.  In addition to this, there will be a clan 
treehouse out in the forest where we can build a larger complex.  The 
wagon will still serve as our main clan hall, but the treehouse will be 
just another safehouse for our crazed members.
``
`fIf you have any ideas, and I am not online, simply drop me a note and 
we'll discuss them.``

`fEntering through an open door, the sight of the \\The Spiral Stairway\\ 
leaves you breathless.  Both up and down, the stairway, made of a dark

the daunting feeling of the stairs are dimly lit globes which give off a 
deep purple glow and cast eerie shadows on the surrounding walls.

at the firm come Monday.  The Mrs.  Will stay with the cheating attorney
moonlighting aside, she really needs his money.  Oh, wonderful caricature of

"virgin" Yes, the one the lawyer met with on "strictly business" as he said
to the Mrs.  Well, only hours before, after he had left, she was fixing her
face in a compact.  There was a terrible crash (There was a terrible crash)
Between her and the badge She spilled her purse and her bag, and held a
"purse" of a different kind.  There are no raindrops on roses and girls in

`cAnother Forested Room````~
Similar to the room above, this room has been recently rennovated to look exactly like it lies in the middle of a forest.
Some benefactor (most likely a clueless one) stood at DSC long enough for the owner of this room to steal them blind.  The room owner
would like to thank Jocko, Neysa, Boltman, Twymm and others for their cluelessness, and thus their generous donations.
The piles of leaves around cover numerous piles of stolen loot, which could be the reason this room resembles a forest.

`aThis room is dark and cold, as though there was a 
constant draft coming through some invisible window. 
However, the walls are made of black, polished stone. 
Dark black material which is embroidered with `bred 
`aand `kgold `athread is hung in the corners of the room, 
giving it a rounded feeling. To the west is a room that is 
faintly lit and the door to the right leads off to the bottom 
of a grave. There is a large spiraling staircase in one 
corner, that leads down into the depths of the clan hall.

The room is very dark lit up only by the faint
glow of the embers left burning in the fireplace.
The room is very cold and the walls are made

`aAn `bAncient `aHall````~
`aThis hall has been left abandoned for many centuries, beautifully crafted `jJade``
`astatues line the upper portion of the walls. Dust particles swirl around you
as you make your way down the long hallway towards two large, sturdy iron doors.
`oEngraved `aupon the two doors is a picture of a noble `nPaladin`a, mounted upon
a `oshining `awhite stallion, leading a group of young adventurers into a mysterious
expedition outside of this realm. `kGolden rays `aof light can be seen coming from
the room beyond the doors.

`oA Cold `aGrey `oRoom````~
`oAs you cross the threshold to this room`a, you can only imagine how beautiful
it once was. There is no source of light that you can see, and the glow
that once illuminated everything in the room has long since faded leaving it cold
and grey. Dead vines cling to the wall with their only evidence of life lying in
the dried rose petals crushed beneath your feet. There is a large bed sitting in
the far corner of the room.  It's four tall posts are made of a dark cherry wood,
while the white bedclothes are now dull with the collection of age and dust. On
the bed are many pillows, each a different size.  All are overstuffed, still inviting
you to come rest on the bed, although it appears no one has for quite some time.
Across from the bed is an oak chest, adorned with many different gems which
provide the only color in the room. This chest holds the belongings of Saphyne
and has been sealed shut with a large iron lock. Next to the chest is a small, once
gurgling fountain, which has slowed to an occasional drip. The echo of each
drop sends chills down you spine making you question how Paen could spend
a single second locked inside of here.``

`aWrinkled grey cloth, covered in cave dust and moth eaten holes is
losely draped from the walls.  The sharp breeze from the long hallway behind
whips the cloth snapping it against the stone it covers.  Wicked looking
weapons dangle from rusted chains in the cieling, twisting and tapping
against eachother.  The floors are clean and glossly black tile with small
dagger emblems etched in silver flakes in the center of each piece.  A Thick
brown desk of newly polished oak is fixed against the back wall, boxing in
the grim figure behind it.

You see all sorts of what looks like ....`be`iy`bes`a... in trophy cases...
Alot of them... he must really like killing people.
As you take a closer look around the room
Everything, even the walls seem to shift and shiver.
Maybe your seeing things, you can't really tell
As you stay in this room, you feel as tho your getting faint and  dizzy.
How can any `hS`oAN`hE`a person live in this room?

The Loft``~
There are many windows in this room, and looking up, one will notice that
it also seems to have no ceiling.  There is a clear view of the sky from
this room.  When it rains, there seems to be nothing in between the room and
the sky.  At night, all of the stars are visible, casting a soft glow in the
room.  There is a meditation mat in the middle of the floor, and this is
where Saphyne comes to relax and contemplate those things that go on out in
the crazy world.

the more secular needs of Ne'shajh, specifically the elimination of key

leave quickly and quietly, as the nameplate on the desk reads: `aKRUNK`l.

look as heavy as mountains they yet seem light as feathers.  Or some for

`dThe Offices of `kSlayer `d& `kSons `dThesden Law````~
`dAs you walk into the law offices of `kSlayer `d& `kSons`d, you still
see the same stone work used throughout the rest of the building, but
noticable effort has gone into dressing the room up a bit.  In the center of
the room there is an elaborate oak desk situated on a fine Teche rug. 
Behind the desk, there is a large bookcase, though it seems rather empty for
a law office.  After taking in the room, you begin to wonder who the Sons
depicted in the name could be, realizing that TalonSlayer, as far as you
know, has no children.

`h.`o:`f|`mc `oWithin the Halls of Storage````~
`hUpon stepping into the storeroom, you are taken aback by the blandness of the
room.  Nearly every room in The Crazed's outpost is elaborately decorated, save
for this one.  The floors are made of a fine white, Shale granite and looks
to have been polished so as to see your reflection on every surface.  Even the
walls of the room, the insides of the tree in so many other rooms, are covered
in plain stone sheets.  As you look around the room, you see three doors other
then the one through which you entered.  Each door stands out from the plain
room with a distinctive look.  To the west, the door is made of `aroughly 
chiseled stone `hwith two crossing blades above it.  To the north, the door is
surrounded by `jbright green vines`h that intertwine with each other creating a
very natural looking door frame.  Finally, to the east, the door is colored in 
a `kbright yellow`h and is `o(`kGlowing`o)`h with magical power.

The Basement``~
Climbing down a set of finely carved granite stairs, you find yourself
in the basement of a small cottage.  The walls are made from driftwood
washed up on the shore and various marine artifacts line the walls.
A bookcase leans against the east wall and you seem to hear the sound
of running water in that direction.

`nUnderwater Paradise````~
Slowly entering this room, and all one can see is water.  The rooom is
made of three glass walls, and on the other side of those walls is the
ocean.  Even the ceiling of the room is glass, and one can see the fish
swimming happily about.  It's as close to home as the canthi can get.  Her
mood seems to change according to the mood of the ocean.  If the waters are
dark and stormy, so are her eyes.  Bright, clear days are her best moods. 
She can feel the ocean through these walls, and it's a nice taste of home
for her.

`aThe cold grey stone sends a shiver up your spine as your footsteps echo off
the walls.  The Armory is simply that, a place where The Crazed store their
various weapons and armors, and nothing more.  The stone walls are chiseled
smooth, but there are no decorations to speak of.  All that resides in the 
cold room is a sword rack filled with various weaponry and a chest in the 
corner for various armors.``

A Small Cave``~
You step into a small cave, a trickle of water flows from the walls
and creates a small river that runs through the cave. It pools in the
middle of the cave making a small pond that can be usec for bathing
or other aquatic activities.

The grim flicker of torches are the only light that penetrates this

in places clawmarks can be seen.  Your eyes are drawn to the most
prominent fixture in the room, a coffin of pitch black sits in the
center of the room and is obviously where someone was laid to rest.

Relic Room~
This room holds a very special relic the pirates found long ago at the
bottom of the sea.  It's a ring of red stone.  The ring is suspended upright
and if you duck a little, you can step into it.  You can see right through
it and it appears to be nothing special, other than an interesting ornament.
It is said, though, that if you were to step through it, you would be moved
to a hidden cave far away somewhere.

An Ancient Pirate Cave~
This stony chamber appears to be completely sealed from the outside
world.  Uneven rocky cavelike walls surround you in all directions and
reflect any sound.  Phosphorous minerals in the cave wall bathe the entire
room in a dim greenish glow.  Flecks of metal embedded in the rock shine and
reflect the light giving the whole place an unnatural look.  More symbols
have been carved into the walls, floor, and ceiling, each of them glowing
softly in a magical violet light.  This cave chamber has been cared for for
eons, but by whom?  Perhaps it was an ancient temple of a long-dead race.

strewn about haphazardly, and as you enter this room you can't help but 
wonder about the personal hygene of the resident. However, the wall

quite good looking, despite his obvious vanity and blatent filthiness.

`d Just inside Biff's brown shell, you find a spacious dining room, set up in
French cafe style, complete with the requisite French muzak tinkling in the
background.  Scattered tables await the hungry, or simply the bored, with menus
of parchment handwritten in beautiful calligraphy.
Along a wall, a huge fish tank bubbles quietly, filled with exotic
fishes and shrimp of all kinds.
Sunlight filters in through Biff's translucent shell, lighting the room and
giving it an airy, lighthearted feel.  Still, looking at the pictures on the wall,
you can't help but feel that something is just slightly off-kilter here...  A
portrait of a banana slug?...``

`kTemple Armory````~
`d Coming through the ancient doorway, you find yourself in a room that
must once have been cleaned with military precision by the temple guards. 
Now, however, it is filled with the stinking mud of the Severn river.  The
blessings of Ne'shajh still must remain even after the ages since this
Temple was lost, because the weapons stored here have suffered little damage
under the thick layer of muck and dust that has settled upon them.  You are
pretty sure that that whispering sound is not the ghost of a long departed
temple guard....

`l Across from the Nre'yth Martial Academy, Varruk's Nre'yth recruiting
center is poised to induct the cream of the military crop into its elite
fighting team.  On any given day several recruits can be found here
discussing Varruk's generous compensation program, or the limitless
opportunities to enslave and eat exotic and foreign people.  Inspirational
posters depicting the heroes of Varruk defending Nre'yth from the human
onslaught line the walls, and a statue of a shackled human with blood
pouring out of his eyes dominates the center of the room.  There are a few
recruiters' desks in the room, and a door to the south leads to the
luxurious Varruk Lounge, where Varruk members on home leave gather to
exchange news and gossip.``

There is a fine collection of stilettos and other items used
for assassination.  Strangely there is also a beautifully
feminine feeling to the room.  The sheets on the bed are soft and
silky, and a cute white teddy bear balances precariously
on the pillow.  A strange humming noise is comming from the 
night stand.  Another enchanted item?  or something else....``

This small, plain room is dimly bright.  The walls and ceiling are made
of pastel pink marble, while a thin padded mat, pastel pink, covers the
floor.  The scent of incense fills the air, though none is visibly burning. 
The hum of magical energy seems to throb rhythmically, like the flow of
blood in veins, encouraging meditation and mental relaxation.

Utter darkness comsumes the room.  As far as can be seen there is but
nothingness.  Calling out for other live there is no reply not even that of
na echo.  Scanning around you find thaere is nowhere else, but the little
light in the center of where you stand which cna not be explained.  Looking
down you see a couple pieces of furniture which where seemed to be spawned
out of thin air.  This truely is a place void of all existence.

-The Black Market-``~
`e Tired of walking, you lean against the wall to get a rock out of your shoe, only to tumble into a hidden storefront.
A rich, deep carpet stretches towards the back of the store, beckoning you in, while strange scents curl around  you
from various cencers and smoking piles of herbs.  Strange and exotic objects from far and near are scattered haphazardly
around on various shelves, tables and cabinets.  A strange, flying beast naps lazily on a cloud towards the ceiling,
its head lolling, and feet kicking at some unknown and far-away dream.  Towards the rear of the store, various
miscreants and thugs mill about, careful not to get to near each other, for fear of being stolen from.  A tall,
dark figure wrapped in a misty cloak is currently arguing with the purveyor of the store, complaining that the staff
of destruction he recently purchased just didn't destroy as thoroughly as was promised.

`aGreat `oHall `iof `aS`op`iy`ar`oi`id`ao`on````~
`oA large hall carved from `ao`on`ay`ox lies before you.  It is very
`lc`no`ll`nd`` `oeven though you can feel the warmth from the great spirits
around you.  You get the feeling that you are wanted and you become enraged
at Thesden.  The time has come, as the `it`ko`ir`kc`ih`ke`is`` `oon the wall
are pointing south, towards the destruction of Thesden.
